2||"The image is spectacular, aglow in DUSK LIGHT: a beautiful BABY,
just born, held in a WOMAN'S HANDS. It is being cleaned; warm
water runs down its face and body.
TIGHT ON the MIDWIFE (female, 60's) who holds and cleans the
baby as it CRIES. Another, younger, Midwife can be seen behind
her, assisting with the pitchers of water. As she cleans the
baby, she says to someone OFF-CAMERA:"|unknown
3||"He is strong.
The baby, now calm, gets SWADDLED.    He is then gently held out
to the new MOTHER:
AMANDA GRAYSON, late 20's. An original beauty. She lies on a
divan, spent but eager to hold her first child. She tenderly
takes the infant into her arms, tears in her eyes, mesmerized.
She holds the wrapped baby tight and whispers sweetly:"|unknown
4||"... hello.
CLOSE ON the YOUNGER MIDWIFE, standing at the rear of the room.
She raises an eyebrow as she quietly speaks:
YOUNGER MIDWIFE
The baby is healthy. Why does she cry?
MIDWIFE
(a beat; then)
She is human.
A distant, quiet BUZZ -- and the elder Midwife stands, looking
into the distance. And this is when we see, for the first time,
that the Midwife has POINTED EARS."|unknown

The Midwife moves away -- we PUSH IN on Amanda, who looks up for
a moment, clearly disquieted.

LEARNING CENTER -- white ""bowls"", sunk into the dark ground,
where PROFESSORS walk, hands behind their backs, surveying this
mass ""mental martial arts"" test.
We're on ANOTHER VULCAN CHILD as she gets an answer wrong -- AND

question. Gets it right. PUSH IN ON HIM as the COMPUTER SAYS:

Your score is one-hundred percent.
Congratulations. Spock.
Off his face, we CUT TO MOMENTS LATER, as Spock collects his
things. As he does, three young VULCAN BULLIES walk up behind
him. Spock glances at them, then back to his things.
YOUNG SPOCK
I presume you've prepared new insults for
today.
VULCAN BULLY #1
Your mother lies with many men.
Spock just NODS.   Tries to ignore the fact that IT STINGS.
YOUNG SPOCK
I have no such information.
VULCAN BULLY #2
You are neither human, nor Vulcan -- and
therefore, have no place in the universe.
YOUNG SPOCK
(swallowing that too)
This is your thirty-fifth attempt to
elicit an emotional response from me.
Logic dictates you would cease by now.
VULCAN BULLY #1
Look. He has human eyes. They look sad,
don't they?
VULCAN BULLY #2
Perhaps an emotional response requires
physical stimuli.
And Bully #2 PUSHES Spock -- who stumbles back, almost falling
into one of the bowls. He looks up as:
VULCAN BULLY #2 (CONT'D)
He's a traitor, you know. Your father.
For marrying her.
Spock stares -- we see him fighting the urge, but he's unable --
AND HE CHARGES THE BULLY AND TACKLES HIM INTO THE BOWL! They
land inside -- Spock cries, flailing as he punches Bully #2!
The other two stand atop the bowl, stunned -- shocked -- unsure
what the hell to do -- and we CUT TO:

tease him -- every day.            physically injured --
-- Which is precisely when
reason must guide his actions

Vulcan, you know that... but
he has to be himself-- which
means, occasionally, being         -- His ""humanity"" is very the

-- When Vulcans get disgusted
with each other, they never

And Amanda walks away, leaving Sarek standing there. He turns --
sees his son down the corridor. Approaches. And we're PUSHING
IN on Spock, studying the fear in his eyes. His father stops in
front of him, looming there, looking down stoically:
YOUNG SPOCK
I did not mean to create conflict between
you and mother.
After a beat, Sarek seems to soften a little.     No anger in his
face. Takes a seat beside his son...
SAREK
In marriage... conflict is...
YOUNG SPOCK
... constant?
SAREK
Natural.
(a beat)
Emotions run deep within our race. In
many ways, more deeply than in humans.
Long ago, they nearly destroyed us...
that is why we followed the teachings of
Surak. Now you must choose.

the house, carrying a duffel. His angrier, redneckier UNCLE

GEORGE JR.
Anywhere but here, far as I can get!

the VULCAN HIGH COUNCIL. Among faces on the dais: his FATHER,
seated beside the SCIENCE MINISTER and other VULCAN LEADERS.
SCIENCE MINISTER
You have surpassed the expectations of
your instructors. Your final record is
flawless. With one exception. I see you
have applied to Starfleet as well.
SPOCK
It was logical to cultivate multiple
options.
SCIENCE MINISTER
Logical but unnecessary. You are hereby
accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy.
A distinction all the more significant
given that you will be its first half-
human pupil. It is truly remarkable,
Spock. That you have achieved so much
despite your disadvantage. Welcome to
the Academy.

""disadvantage"" are you referring to?

father to say something, but Sarek's the consummate diplomat.

the first spontaneous -- human -- decision of his life --

Council -- ministers.    I must decline.
Everyone STOPS.   A solid BEAT.   Confused looks turn cold:

this academy.

Then as I am half-human, your record
remains untarnished.

Spock. You have made a
commitment to honor the Vulcan       At the moment, Father, I can

KIRK (CONT'D)
Okay, so you're a cadet. Studying.
What's your focus?
UHURA
Xenolinguistics. Lemme guess: you don't
know what that means.
KIRK
Let me guess: study of Alien languages:
phonology, morphology, syntax-- it means
you've got a talented tongue.

And for a moment I thought you were just
a dumb hick who only has sex with farm
animals.
KIRK
Well.    Not only.

told me who you are.
KIRK

PIKE
Your father's son.
(then, smiles)
For my dissertation, I was assigned the
U.S.S. Kelvin. Something I admired about
your dad... he didn't believe in no-win
scenarios.
KIRK
He sure learned his lesson.
PIKE
Depends on how you define winning.
You're here, aren't you?
(off Kirk's look)
That instinct to leap without looking--
that was his nature, too. And in my
opinion it's something Starfleet has
lost. We're admirable, respectable. But
overly-disciplined.

competent officers -- but you can bet
your ass they'll run home to momma the

443||"So your daddy dies... you can settle for
a less-than-ordinary life.
(beat)
Or do you feel like you're meant for
something better? Something special?
And that just hangs there for a beat. Because Pike just hit a
nerve. Kirk does his best not to show it -- still absent-
mindedly fiddling with STARFLEET SHIP SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS.
KIRK
Come to think of it, I do want to feel
special. You know what? I'm gonna go
start a book club--
PIKE
Enlist in Starfleet.
KIRK
Enlist. You must be way down on your
recruiting quota for the month--
PIKE
If you're half the man your father was,
Jim, Starfleet could use you. You could
be an officer in four years, have your
own ship in eight.
He's getting under Kirk's skin -- but Kirk keeps up the 'tude,
grabs his jacket, stands --
KIRK
We're even, right?   I can go.
PIKE
Riverside shipyard. Shuttle for new
recruits leaves tomorrow, 0800.
(Kirk turns, Pike grabs
him)
Your father was Captain of a Starship.
For twelve minutes. I dare you to do
better.
Eyes lock... and it's now Pike who stands and walks off.   And
that's where it hangs. Off Kirk, brooding...

fighting it -- he cranks it, ELECTRIC ENGINE SCREAMING --

63   EXT. STARFLEET CONSTRUCTION YARD - SUNRISE                       63
Kirk pulls up to us, kills the bike. Camera starts to MOVE
AROUND HIM -- he's dramatically BACKLIT and we COME AROUND for
an INCREDIBLE REVEAL of a SHIPYARD -- at its center, the
skeletal frame of a NEW SHIP under arclights. UNMISTAKABLY, THE
U.S.S. ENTERPRISE. Unformed, raw, like its future captain. Our
MUSIC SWELLS, we PUSH IN ON HIM, considering Pike's offer, his
future, his fate.
64   EXT. STARFLEET SHIPYARD - MORNING                                64
The shipyard is abuzz with activity -- cadets loading into a
shuttle -- and Pike, staring off, waiting. The PILOT
approaches:
SHUTTLE PILOT
Waiting for something, Cap?
PIKE
... No.   Guess not.
He climbs in. The pilot rapidly flips through switches, running
a pre-flight sequence. Pike straps in. Glances through the
viewshield... SEES SOMETHING... and he smiles. From his POV:
KIRK on his MOTORCYCLE, driving into the shipyard --
PIKE (CONT'D)
Hold her a second...
Kirk rides past a WATERFALL of cooling tanks -- stops the bike
near the shuttle -- steps off, has nothing -- no bags -- just
the clothes on his back.
SHIPYARD WORKER
Nice ride, man.
Kirk kicks the stand, tosses the guy the startcard --
KIRK
Live it up.
Kirk walks past the startled worker and approaches Pike.
KIRK (CONT'D)
Four years?   I'm gonna do it in three.
Pike grins as Kirk passes him.
Inside the shuttle, Kirk moves down rows of new recruits, some
of them ALIEN. Passes UHURA and the BARFIGHT CADETS, who PERK
UP when they see him -- one has a BANDAGED HAND.

KIRK (CONT'D)
At ease, Gentlemen.
(then, to Uhura)
Never did get that first name.
UHURA
(can't help it: a grin)
And you never will.
He smiles as he takes a seat at the back of the shuttle.   Straps
in as it RISES...
MAN'S VOICE
Are you people deaf? I told you I don't
need a doctor, damnit! I AM A DOCTOR!
Kirk turns to see a MAN being forced OUT of the BATHROOM by a
FEMALE FLIGHT OFFICER -- at 34, he has a Southern lilt and looks
like a prisoner waiting for the guillotine to fall:
FLIGHT OFFICER                          MAN
-- you need to find a seat --     -- I had one, in the bathroom,
Darlin', with no windows --
-- Sir, for your own safety,      -- I suffer from Aviaphobia,
siddown, or I will MAKE you       case you don't understand big
sit down... do you hear me?       words, it means 'fear of dying
RIGHT NOW.                        in something that flies.'
They GLARE at each other, then the man drops into the seat
beside Kirk. The ship TORQUES to one side and the man GRIPS his
armrests, pale, sweating -- glances at Kirk:
MAN
I might throw up on you.
KIRK
I think these things're pretty safe--
MAN
Don't pander to me, kid: one tiny crack
in the hull and our blood boils in
thirteen seconds -- solar flare might
crop up, cook us in our seats -- Hell,
some of the damn passengers are blue.
And wait'll you're sitting pretty with a
case of Andorian shingles, see if you're
still so relaxed when your eyeballs are
bleeding-- space is disease and danger,
wrapped in darkness and silence.
KIRK
I hate to break this to you, but
Starfleet operates in space.

KIRK
Enlighten me again.
SPOCK
The purpose is to experience fear. Fear
in the face of certain death. To accept
that fear and maintain command of one's
self and one's crew. This is a quality
expected in every Starfleet captain.
Kirk absorbs that.   Then --
KIRK
So you're telling me the point.      Of the
whole thing. Is to be afraid?
SPOCK
Fear is necessary, yes.
KIRK
Have you taken the test, Commander Spork?
SPOCK
Spock. As a Vulcan, I require no
additional training to control my
narcissism when making command decisions.
No he DIN'T!   Kirk's hit guys for a lot less -- The crowd all
but ""OOOOOOHs."" But Kirk ain't fucking done yet.
KIRK
You keep reminding me that you're Vulcan.
And I'm sure you're really proud of that,
who wouldn't be-- but isn't it true you
people don't experience fear at all?
ON SPOCK. He raises that eyebrow. And Kirk sees... no matter
how subtly... that he has fucking made CONTACT. Smelling blood -
KIRK (CONT'D)
And if that's the case -- What's that say
about your ability to make command
decisions?
Well. Looks like Kirk just hit him in HIS fucking weak spot.
And before this lovefest can continue --

A REDSHIRT bursts into the HALL -- Kirk turns to look -- they
all do -- now we're SPEEDING IN behind the REDSHIRT, who runs to
the President, hands him a DATAPAD. President reads it.
Everyone watches, on edge -- finally, quietly:
ACADEMY PRESIDENT
(to all)
We've received a distress call from
Vulcan.
(Spock reacts concerned)
Cadet Kirk -- you are on academic
probation pending the result of your
hearing. Cadets, report to Shuttle
Hangar One immediately -- this hearing is
at recess until further notice --
dismissed.
Everyone's on their feet, MOVING QUICKLY, Kirk suddenly
irrelevant. PIKE passes by him, all fucking business, but
before he goes --
PIKE
Cheating isn't winning.
And as that settles on Kirk, McCoy now joins him. The two
exiting with the rest of the cadets as Kirk eyes SPOCK --

You're on academic probation. That means

Kirk is POLEAXED as Leader heads off -- McCoy, needing to run:
MCCOY

Most likely.
(Kirk is just rocked)
Look, Jim -- I gotta go --
KIRK
... yeah-- yeah, you go... I'm good.
Kirk forces a half-smile. Torn, McCoy hurries off. PULL AWAY
from Kirk, alone as the mass of newly-minted cadets criss-
crosses around him. At the hangar entrance, McCoy suddenly
STOPS: a lightbulb. He quickly returns to Kirk, pulls him off:
MCCOY                              KIRK

Uhura serpentines through the group to SPOCK --

Spock moves away from the officers, a private moment with her:
SPOCK
Yes, Lieutenant?
UHURA

UHURA
