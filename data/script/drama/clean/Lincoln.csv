feet deep. Cannons and carts, half-submerged and tilted,
their wheels trapped in the mud below the surface, are still
yoked to dead and dying horses and oxen.
A terrible battle is taking place; two infantry companies,
Negro Union soldiers and white Confederate soldiers, knee-
deep in the water, staggering because of the mud beneath,
fight each other hand-to-hand, with rifles, bayonets,
pistols, knives and fists. There's no discipline or strategy,
nothing depersonalized: it's mayhem and each side intensely
hates the other. Both have resolved to take no prisoners."|stage direction|||

the fireplace, in which embers are dying, there's a long
table, eight chairs around it, settings by each chair of
inkwells and pens.
Dozens of maps cover the walls and the crowded bookcases.
Lincoln opens the door and enters to find his 10 year-old son
TAD LINCOLN near the hearth, sleeping, sprawled on a very
large military map. Lead toy soldiers are scattered across
it.
A large mahogany box, imprinted ALEXANDER GARDNER STUDIOS,
is open near Tad's head. The box contains large glass plates,
each framed in wood; these are photographic negatives. Tad's
been looking at several, which lie near him on the map."|stage direction|||

scrutinizes the precisely drawn blue and grey lines.

firelight: it's a large photographic negative of a young
black boy. There's a caption, in elegant cursive script:
""Abner, age 12 - $500""
And another: ""Two young boys, 10 & 14 - $700""
Lincoln puts the plates back in the box and closes the lid.
Carefully brushing the toy soldiers aside, he lies down
beside Tad. He touches Tad's hair and kisses his forehead.
Tad stirs as Lincoln gets on all fours; without really waking
up, knowing the routine, Tad climbs onto his father's back.

powers are. Some say they don't
exist. I don't know. I decided I
needed them to exist to uphold my
oath to protect the Constitution,
which I decided meant that I could
take the rebels' slaves from `em as
property confiscated in war. That
might recommend to suspicion that I
agree with the rebs that their
slaves are property in the first
place. Of course I don't, never
have, I'm glad to see any man free,
and if calling a man property, or
war contraband, does the trick...
Why I caught at the opportunity.
Now here's where it gets truly
slippery. I use the law allowing
for the seizure of property in a
war knowing it applies only to the
property of governments and
27.
citizens of belligerent nations.
But the South ain't a nation,
that's why I can't negotiate with
'em. So if in fact the Negroes are
property according to law, have I
the right to take the rebels'
property from `em, if I insist
they're rebels only, and not
citizens of a belligerent country?
And slipperier still: I maintain it
ain't our actual Southern states in
rebellion, but only the rebels
living in those states, the laws of
which states remain in force. The
laws of which states remain in
force. That means, that since it's
states' laws that determine whether
Negroes can be sold as slaves, as
property - the Federal government
doesn't have a say in that, least
not yet -
(a glance at Seward,"|speech|LINCOLN|M|True
296|THEN:)|"- then Negroes in those states are
slaves, hence property, hence my
war powers allow me to confiscate
`em as such. So I confiscated `em.
But if I'm a respecter of states'
laws, how then can I legally free
`em with my Proclamation, as I
done, unless I'm cancelling states'
laws? I felt the war demanded it;
my oath demanded it; I felt right
with myself; and I hoped it was
legal to do it, I'm hoping still."|speech|||

no amendment abolishing slavery.
Say it's after the war, and I can
no longer use my war powers to just
ignore the courts' decisions, like
I sometimes felt I had to do. Might
those people I freed be ordered
back into slavery? That's why I'd
like to get the Thirteenth
