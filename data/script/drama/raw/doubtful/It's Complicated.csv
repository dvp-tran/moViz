BAKERY/RESTAURANT. The bakery counter could rival any in
Paris. Last year, The New York Times rated Jane's pain au
chocolat the best in the United States. A line waits to get

A very relaxed Jane is behind the busy counter, easily moving
between her young staff. The atmosphere is efficient and
friendly.
Jane adjusts a few signs on the counter, then reaches inside
the display case, pulling out a tray of muffins topped with
powdered sugar. She carries the tray to the open pass-
through to the BUSY KITCHEN and calls to the head Baker.
JANE
Reynaldo...
(nods to the muffins)
REYNALDO
Too much sugar.
JANE
Little bit.
Reynaldo nods as Jane hands him the tray.
Jane notices a line waiting to get up to the bakery counter.
Knowing what to do, Jane's staff has already set out cups of
coffee with lids.
JANE
Who wants coffee while they're
waiting?
Jane and the staff hand out the free coffee.
JANE WALKS THE COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER

Employee)
Check on table five, will you?

the other side of the counter. They exchange polite hellos

JANE

Peter!
PETER joins ADAM, the man who stands across from Jane. Adam
is handsome in a way that sneaks up on you. There's
something reserved and refreshing about his demeanor. He
holds rolled blueprints.

ever met Adam Schaeffer?

No.                             Yes.
