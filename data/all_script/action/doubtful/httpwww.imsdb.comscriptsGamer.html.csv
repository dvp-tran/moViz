September 2007
Some   of   them   want   to   use you
Some   of   them   want   to   get used by you
Some   of   them   want   to   abuse you
Some   of   them   want   to   be abused

Some years from this exact moment...
1   INT. TRAIN - DAY                                                  1
DARKNESS - NOW
The beautiful CHIMING SOUNDS OF SPACE TRAVEL through the
COSMOS... DOTS OF LIGHT whiz past our face.
They could be stars at lightspeed, or... SUBWAY LIGHTS
FLICKER ON - in a flash we see PALE, SULLEN FACES, riding
into a bleak future, and hear the INDUSTRIAL CLATTER. It's
dark, claustrophobic, obscure... the rhythmic beat of track
and wheel-clicks engulf us. The lights flicker back on and
hold as we see a half dozen SOLDIERS in BROWN CAMO, steel-
eyed, prepared for whatever may be at the end of the TUNNEL.
ZERO IN on TWO:
KABLE, 30-something, roughneck... focused, determined; eyes
burning with internalized emotion...
... and SANDRA, late 20s, undeniably hot but tough as hell -
both are in shackles & cuffs, being roughly transported
through underground tunnels, knocked and shoved around.
Uniformed GUARDS roam the train, looking pissed off - their
swagger seems to mask FEAR.
KABLE is meditating, or exhausted - hard to tell.   The GIRL
makes eye contact w/ him.

KABLE'S skull snaps back into the window. The GUARD swings
again, this time nailing KABLE square in the stomach.
SANDRA
(to the GUARD, a snarl)
Putcher dick away...
GUARD
Get some.
CRACKK!! CRACK!! CRACKK!! ... CRACK!!     SANDRA is buckled
over, awkwardly, hands behind her back tethered to the seat,
head dripping blood. KABLE jerks against his restraints,
every inch of him wanting to RIP THE MOTHERFUCKER APART...
He uses his elbow to help her back up, but SANDRA fights
through it, sits back up and spits blood - she can handle
herself.
The CAMERA holds TIGHT on KABLE and SANDRA... KABLE lets a
glob of blood dangle from his mouth, biting his lip, bearing
it... we hear the CRUNCHING SOUND of the CLUB working on the
others... and the METALLIC RUMBLE and CLATTER of the TRAIN -
growing louder, POUNDING, slamming into our brains, blotting
out all thought... until...
2   INT. TUNNEL #1 - DAY                                                    2
POV: we are RUNNING, ragged, full sprint, down a TUNNEL
towards dirty white DAYLIGHT...
NO MUSIC - just heavy breath, KABLE'S HEARTBEAT and the sound
of his boots bouncing off the concrete...
Others are running with us - SOLDIERS with weapons... at the
tunnel's end: vaguely defined shapes of buildings, smoke,
sky...
Our POV WHITES OUT as we...
3   EXT. SPAWN POINT #1 - CONTINUOUS                                        3
... smash into the DAYLIGHT.
Smoke plumes hang from a recent skirmish. KABLE climbs over
burning debris, gun raised, as SANDRA and the other soldiers
disappear into the grey mist.
4   EXT. SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1                                            4

... a DESTROYED CITY - PHILLY? DETROIT? NY? Seemingly out
of character, he LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR SLO-MO and lands in an
OVERDRAMATIC, ROCKSTAR POSE (Nine Inch Nails, Coachella
2005).
In sequence, multicolored LEDs on his weapon COME TO LIFE -
accompanied by a low frequency hum that seems to pierce
somewhere below human hearing. The MULTIPLE TURRETS spin,
then snap into place. GO TIME.
5   OTHER SPAWN POINTS                                                  5
Other BROWN SOLDIERS emerge like SNAKES out of DIRT HOLES and
INTO THE LIGHT. They crouch and spread out.
6   SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1                                             6
What appear like BUZZING FLIES swarm thru the grey air - at a
closer look, they are like tiny BALL BEARINGS that move like
hummingbirds, magnetically controlled. The swarm splits
apart - each FLY connects with a different SOLDIER - they
hover one foot above and two feet behind the SOLDIER'S head.
7   SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - COVER                                     7
KABLE slides behind a shredded telephone pole and TAKES
COVER. The sound of trains, weapons, soldiers all fade
away... until...
NOTHING.   DEAD QUIET.
SUDDENLY - A BULLET WHIZZES by KABLE's face - a pause - THEN
we hear a GUNSHOT.
Another BULLET WHIRS by his leg and another by his shoulder -
after the bullets pass, we hear the GUNSHOTS. See the
lightning, wait for the thunder.
In the peripheral a SOLDIER in DEEP BLUE CAMO runs from
behind an old car to a brick staircase.   Then another BLUE
runs the opposite way, closer in the foreground. BROWNS VS.
BLUES?? The SILENCE is crawling, deafening, and then...
BOOM.
ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. Suddenly we are in IRAQ TIMES TEN...
KABLE'S eyes glance down at his WEAPON - the turrets quickly
shift and rotate - he whips it up in a flash and RETURNS FIRE
into the mist:
THOOM! THOOM!   The shells puncture air and connect
distantly...

The air ripples all around him, his world closing in... he
breaks free and runs toward an open street - THE TURRETS
READJUST - he efficiently wastes two BLUES with automatic
fire.
8   SLAYERS BATTLEGROUND #1 - OPEN STREET                                8
A couple of PEDESTRIANS walk across the street, totally
IGNORING THE VIOLENCE. KABLE makes a perfect 90 degree cut
and wraps around a street-lamp and into the alley. A BUM
holds out a can with a couple of coins and SHAKES it.
From an aerial POV we see the area swarming with BROWN & BLUE
combatants and a dozen CIVILIANS.   In the top right corner
of our frame we see the DULL REFLECTION of a FACE, somewhat
transparent, watching the battle, tungsten red (similar to
your own reflection on a TV).
We SNAP BACK to the ground - the whole area is a BATTLEZONE.
KABLE lines up another BLUE climbing the fire-escape to the
third floor window - and then, coming from the REAR SURROUND
SPEAKERS, behind us:
A VOICE - almost a whisper, too clean and distinct to be
outdoors in this environment... and TOO YOUNG to possibly
belong to KABLE.
VOICE (O.S.)
(clean, disconnected)
Eat shit please.
THWIPPP!! The BLUE drops like a sack. KABLE perfectly cuts
back another 90 degrees and runs for an old store front.
Inside a CLERK ""air"" bags groceries for an empty store.
A BROWN SOLDIER sets up a TRIPOD MACHINE GUN and aims for a
bunker a hundred yards north. The distant BLUE targets seem
almost robotically unaware. The BROWN SOLDIER plants his
left hand on the ground for stability, right hand twisting
the grip-lock - and squeezing the trigger: TAT TAT TAT TAT
TAT TAT!!!! TATATATATATATATATA TAT!! The BLUES fall, some
clumsily colliding into each other before they crash to the
ground, dead.
Another team of BLUES rock their heads around to focus on
him. Uh oh...
BOOOOOSH!!!! The BROWN TRIPOD GUNNER is vaporized from the
knees up... the FOREARM that supported him is standing
straight up, cleanly severed at the elbow. It slowly wobbles
over and connects with the TWO LEGS severed at the knees.
The THREE LIMBS fall into each other, forming a flesh and
bone TRIPOD.

FLIES.
He pokes at it - it instantly jukes left; again - it jukes
right... almost faster than the eye can follow. No way he
could ever touch it.
Semi-satisfied, he holds out the metal dish and clicks the
remote. The FLY drops into the dish - CLINK.
CLOSE-UP: the little gunmetal ball is black and dented on one
side - probably the one we saw get knocked out of the air.
There is a PINHOLE GLASS LENS on the other end.

break off from the choreography to ENGAGE HIM; turns out

CASTLE backs away, whistling the melody, and continues his
SOFTSHOE to the music as KABLE wades into brutal hand-to-hand
