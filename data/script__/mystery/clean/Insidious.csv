5||"A spherical black monolith rises up from a white surface...
white like the moon.
In the darkness, the towers metal skin is barely visible.
We ROTATE AROUND, revealing the tower to actually be a LAMP --
not rising up from a surface, but hanging down from a white
ceiling. The bulb unlit.
Directly below the lamp is the very definition of innocence -
a sleeping child. Chest rising and falling with each breath.
We HOVER over the young boy...watching him. A blanket
emblazoned with dinosaurs is draped across his limbs. His
mouth is slack, eyelids twitching to dreams unseen.
The truly deep sleep that an adult can only wish for.
We move away from him, exploring the dark room. Strewn with
toys. The door is slightly ajar. We float through it into--"|stage direction||

the boys rhythmic breathing, even quieter.
A window at the end of the hall enlarges as we approach.
Someone is standing in front of it.
The murky silhouette of the figure turns and walks away. We
follow it, tentative. Turning a corner, we see the figure.
Standing in a doorway.
Now we can make out the edges of the person. It is an old
woman. Hair in a Victorian bun. A corseted dress.
She stares at us."|stage direction||

12||"Eyes flick open.
A woman blinks awake, gazing around the room. Another
bedroom. Sparse. Just a bed and a cabinet. It is 5.43 AM.
Her eyes settle on the man lying next to her in the dark. His
heaving snores have woken her up.
She is RENAI (pronounced Renee) LAMBERT (36). With a quiet
determination she is holding on to her youthful good looks,
but the lines of age are creeping in.
She has settled into the `comfort' years of a marriage: hair
pinned up messily, wearing dowdy pajamas.
She beholds her husband, taking him in. Considering him. He
snorts and smacks his lips. Very unflattering.
She climbs out of bed."|stage direction||

14||"High ceilings. Exposed beams. Spanish style windows.
Renai treads across wooden floorboards into a sunken living
room. No matter careful she is, there is a loud creak with
each step. A GRANDFATHER CLOCK in the corner ticks steadily.
There is barely any furniture in here, only a BOOKCASE and a
PIANO. What there is a lot of...is boxes. Large moving boxes.
Renai plops cross-legged onto the floor and rips open one of
the boxes, marked BOOKS. She plucks out a handful of books
and lines them up on the bookshelf. Then another handful.
They are all self-help and self-improvement books. Titles
like `Be The Better You' and `Inch By Inch, It's A Cinch: A
Guide To Achieving Your Goals' pop out.
She spots a sealed box labelled PHOTO ALBUMS. She strips away
the tape and wrestles out a dusty album of wedding photos.
Smiling faces greet her as she thumbs through the pages. The
happy couple. Young. Glowing. Sadness washes over her."|stage direction||

Elise inhales and exhales deeply, slipping away. Soon, she is
very still.
Specs nods to Tucker silently, then produces an odd looking
device made from GREY CLOTH.
It almost resembles a gas mask from World War 1, with a cone
shaped muzzle that fits over the mouth and nose. The snout of
the facemask is like an elongated elephant trunk, coiling
outwards and ending in an old listening device, like an early
version of a microphone.
Specs slips two hooks over Elise's ears and gently places the
device over her nose and mouth. He then takes a seat next to
her, behind Renai, who holds Elise's hand.

Dalton stares at them...not a trace of emotion on his face.

Renai SCREAMS into the abyss as Dalton BELLOWS at them, spit
flying from his throat, his tongue hanging down over his
dislocated jaw.
He stamps his foot and the table - and everyone sitting at

by a hurricane, smashing into the wall with crushing power.
We realize that Dalton was not sitting at the table, but
squatting down awkwardly. Painfully.
He stands up, then steps forward. As Josh and Renai watch,
his KNEE begins to BEND BACKWARDS, the tendons stretching and
snapping, the knee bending in the opposite direction.
His other knee follows and he steps forward - both knees
bending back.
Specs is rigid in his chair, rooted to the spot, notepad
still in hand. When he looks up at Dalton, the flashlight
under his chin shines in Dalton's eyes.
Dalton ROARS and advances forward - SLAPPING Specs with the
force of ten men. Specs reels backwards, hitting the wall,
smashing his head and crumpling like paper.
Elise stands to face Dalton. The CAMERA FLASH goes off again,
lighting the darkened room for a split second and showing
Elise the lipstick-smeared face of a demon instead of
Dalton's face.

Elise turns to see Josh. The camera flash STROBES repeatedly

terrified. Josh suddenly LUNGES at her, slapping the camera
out of her hands."|stage direction||

unnerves Renai. When the lion-tamer drops his whip and runs,
you know the lion is vicious.
Elise opens her mouth to speak...but nothing comes out.
Instead, she simply holds up the camera, showing Renai the

Woman!
Elise lowers the camera, horrified. For a beat, the Old Woman
just glares at her...
...then she CHARGES at Elise, arms outstretched, wrapping her
white hands around the soft flesh of Elise's throat.
Elise CHOKES, eyes bulging, spittle flying from her mouth, as
the pale hands of the Old Woman dig into her thorax, droplets
of blood running down her chest where the yellowing finger-
nails have CUT IN to the flesh.
The Old Woman smiles - a merciless harlequin grin that mocks
Elise's pain.
She lets Elise go, letting her drop to the floor.

She lights the candle with a match, holding it beneath her
chin and glaring into the reflective surface of the mirror."|stage direction||
