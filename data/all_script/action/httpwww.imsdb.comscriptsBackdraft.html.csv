as we hear two children arguing."|stage direction

4|YOUNGER KID|Shut up.|speech
5|OLDER KID|You're doing it wrong.|speech
6||"It's hard, but we get a sense of the room in the whipping
beam of light. Huge, dark coats lined up like sides of beef
on steel batons. Bent, stained helmets hung like African
masks.
Beneath them BRIAN, 7, and STEPHEN, 12, are trying to struggle
into a pair of the ludicrously massive coats over their
pajamas."|stage direction
7|STEPHEN|It doesn't go like that.|speech
8|BRIAN|Who asked you?|speech
9|STEPHEN|"If you do it like that it'll open in
the fire. Then you'll get burned and
DIE."|speech
10||"The door suddenly opens, morning sunlight roaring in. It's a
fire station storage room full of fire gear. A fireman stands
in the doorway, tall, athletic, their father; DENNIS
McCAFFREY."|stage direction

14|DENNIS|Well, let's have a look.|speech
15||INT. FIRE STATION 17 - DAY|location
16||"The two boys tromp out of the closet. The rubber turn-out
boots are as high as their thighs. The ends of the coats
drag on the floor. They salute, Brian's arm just an empty
sleeve. Dennis kneels down and re-fastens Brian's coat."|stage direction
17|DENNIS|"Your brother's right. If you don't
fasten these correctly they could
open and you'd get burned."|speech
18|STEPHEN|And DIE!|speech
19|BRIAN|"You wouldn't let me die, would you,
Dad?"|speech

places."|stage direction
41||EXT. FIRE STATION 17 - DAY|location
42||"There's a cough of diesel, a crunch of gears, and the engine
is pulling out of the station."|stage direction
43|DENNIS|Hit the button, Brian.|speech
44||"Brian stamps his foot on the siren button. The red light
snaps on, the siren growls and blares, and they're off down
the street. Brian turns around in his seat and, at the last
instant before the corner, makes eye contact with his older
brother.
They stick their tongues out."|stage direction
45||EXT. CHICAGO STREET - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER|location
46||"The engine howls its way through the city. Brian, sandwiched
between his father and Adcox, looks out in wonderment at
intersections zipping past like picket fences, at people on
sidewalks holding hands over their ears, at the red emergency
lights bouncing crazily off shop windows."|stage direction
47||EXT. BUILDING - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER|location
48||"Lazy smoke curls out the second story of a commercial block.
Medium deal. The engine pulls up and the firemen are jumping
off like ship rats. Dennis opens his door, hops down, and
pauses just long enough to point a serious finger at his
son."|stage direction
49|DENNIS|Stay near the truck.|speech
50||(winks)|location
51|DENNIS|"And keep an eye out for us, huh?
We're short handed today."|speech
52||"Brian nods vigorously, taking the command seriously. Dennis
smiles and is off, dragging a hoseline with his crew toward
a doorway they disappear into. Brian climbs down from the
cab."|stage direction
53|ENGINEER|Don't stray too far, little man.|speech
54||"Brian smiles to the pumper operator. He just wants a better
look. And he gets it: Smoke turned evil and dark now, taking
on purpose."|stage direction
55||EXT. BUILDING - DAY - 20 YRS. EARLIER|location
56||"There's a level of apartments above the storefronts. As Brian
watches, a window opens and out steps his father and Adcox
onto a small fire escape. Their attention's on the next window
over, out of reach, wrapped in leaky smoke.
Suddenly Dennis climbs up onto the fire escape railing, armed
with only an axe, and JUMPS across to the next metal balcony.
A ballsy, dangerous move. He kicks in the window, breaks out
the frame with his axe, and dives in.
A beat later he reemerges on the balcony with a terrified,
smudged little girl. He hands the little girl over the railing
to a fireman now coming up the more traditional way -- a
ladder.
Dennis's face lifts and grins at Brian; dirty, bigger than
life, invincible. He winks a wink only possible between
fathers and sons and he's gone again, back into the swirling
darkness. As Brian stands there, full of love, full of pride,
he sees a piece of awning along the roofline crack; releasing
a sickly yellow tongue of flame that slinks over the roof.
The flame seems to pause, to stare at Brian a beat. Shhh,
don't tell anyone. Brian is transfixed, his little head
staring up in astonishment.
Nobody else has noticed it.
Brian can see his father and Adcox through the window;
probing, looking for the flame lurking just above. Brian
starts to call out in a small, hesitant voice,"|stage direction
57|BRIAN|Dad...|speech
58||"He tries to call louder... But suddenly everything is
happening very fast in slow motion:
-- Brian can see Adcox testing the ceiling with a pike pole
as Brian steps forward, under the power of a flame that
beckons him as --
Dennis suddenly THROWS his body against Adcox, knocking him
clear just as a flame EXPLODES DOWNWARD from the ceiling
fully against him as -- All the building's windows BLOW OUT
and it's like the sky's erupted for Brian, a burning hailstorm
that falls and pelts the ground around him. Plaster, wood,
and something metal that cracks against the pavement and
spins slowly.
A fire helmet.
And Adcox is coming out the door now, blackened and torn,
hopeless tears streaming down his face."|stage direction
59|AXE|"Get us some backup! We need some
goddamn backup!"|speech
60||"And, spotting Brian, he runs towards him. And the helmet
spins and spins and Adcox keeps running, and the sky is
raining fire, and the flame on the roof has risen up now to
its full, horrifying size and it's laughing now, laughing at
the little boy as the helmet finally stops spinning, and we
read the printing on the neck guard.
MCCAFFREY
And Adcox is sobbing and has his arms around the boy,
protecting him from the fire, the world, but it's like Brian
doesn't see him. He pulls away from Adcox, walks up to his
father's helmet, And puts it on.
The scene EXPLODES with a flash as a photographer captures
the instant."|stage direction

LIFE. The magazine jiggles and rocks and we see now it's
sitting atop a box of knick-knacks jostling in the back seat
of an aging BMW. There's plenty of other boxes here, a live
on the move, and in the driver's seat, BRIAN McCAFFREY, now
27. There's piles of empty burger wrappers, Coke cans, and
Florida knick-knacks on the dash board; a little blow-up
palm tree, a cheesy hula girl emblazoned with ""McCaffrey

Tonight the place is firmly in the hands of an army of

hooked up a charged hoseline and are taking potshots at

One of the engine companies is entering the doorway now. He
watches as they willingly crawl into a place any sane person
would run for their life from. Jesus Christ. FLASH -- Brian
turns at the blinding snap of a camera. Several locals are
gathered around a parked car, some taking pictures. Brian
notices that right away. It takes a beat longer to notice
the CHARRED CORPSE stuffed head-first through the windshield.
It's the Porsche driver, his legs sticking out at crazy

Struggling against the insane swirls and the sheets of water
still POURING DOWN, Brian unhooks his air tank. He leans
back, tries to float on the rising column of water. -- His
coat catches on something -- YANKS him underwater. He
struggles feverishly -- finally tears the coat off.
The building GROANS in earnest. Flaming chunks of plaster
CRASH down around Brian, forcing him to duck underwater. The
place is coming apart.
Ten feet above, one of the falling chunks SMACKS a gas main,
SPLITTING then IGNITING it. A white-hot JET OF FLAME SHOOTS
from one side of the shaft to the other.
Brian's floating okay, he's floating right up into the flames.
Brian tries to flatten himself out, to keep everything but
his nose below water, but he's still moving up -- the heat
becoming so intense his face flares and he's ducking under
water now, trying to stay alive, trying to decide whether to
drown or burn --
-- When there's a CRASH. And suddenly another door on the
shaft is tearing open. There's a glint of an axe. A
flashlight.
It's Stephen.
Brian has about two seconds left. In that time Stephen sees
the shut-off for the gas line mounted on the wall opposite.
It's unreachable, a good twelve feet across a horizontal
curtain of flame. Before we can even assimilate that,
Stephen's already jumped. A crazy leap over the fire. He
SMACKS the opposite wall, HITS the shut-off, and FALLS

Nightengale's lost his helmet and it's lying near the flames

where it EXPLODES -- a cloud of extinguisher powder that
STUNS the flames just long enough for Brian to dash through
and TACKLE the hose.
The fire shakes off the powder, rises up to kill -- Just as
Brian spins and HITS it with the STREAM.

with each other -- Pengelly and Nightengale have an opening,

now --
