1||"FADE IN:
In the darkness, we hear a voice, a woman's voice.  Her name
is Evey."|stage direction
2|EVEY (V.O.)|"""Remember, remember, the fifth of
November, the gunpowder treason and
plot.  I know of now reason why the
gunpowder treason should ever be
forgot."""|speech
3||"Her voice has a strength that is metered by a calmness, a
deep centered peace that we can feel."|stage direction
4|EVEY (V.O.)|"Those were almost the very first
words he spoke to me and, in a way,
that is where this story began,
four hundred years ago, in a cellar
beneath the Houses of Parliament."|speech
5||"In the darkness, we find a lantern.  Guy Fawkes, a dangerous
man who wears a goatee, is struggling with a wheelbarrow
stacked with barrels of gunpowder."|stage direction
6|EVEY (V.O.)|"In 1605, Guy Fawkes attempted to
blow up the Houses of Parliament."|speech
7||"The wheelbarrow bumps over the heavy stone mortar of the
cellar floor.  From the dark depths, we hear the sound of
dogs."|stage direction
8|EVEY (V.O.)|"He was caught in the cellars with
enough gunpowder to level most of
London."|speech
9||"Guy sees lanterns coming from both sides.  He tries to run as
the dogs reach him first.  He grabs for his sword as dozens
of pole axes pin him against the tunnel's stone wall."|stage direction
10|EVEY (V.O.)|"Sometimes I wonder where we would
be if he hadn't failed.  I wonder
if it would have mattered."|speech
11||In the dim pre-dawn light, Guy is led to the gallows.|stage direction
12|EVEY (V.O.)|"I suppose the answer is in the
rhyme.  More than the man, what we
must remember is the plot itself."|speech
13||"The coarse noose of rope is snugged up to Guy's throat.  He
looks into the crowd until he finds a face, a woman's face,
staring up at him."|stage direction
14|EVEY (V.O.)|"For in the plot we find more than
just a man, we find the idea of
that man, the spirit of that man,
and that is what we must never
forget."|speech
15||"The lever is thrown and the woman looks down, a tear falling
down her face."|stage direction
16|EVEY (V.O.)|"This, then, is the story of that
idea, of that spirit that began
with an anarchist's plot four
hundred years ago."|speech

morning sun."|stage direction

hair."|stage direction
22|EVEY (V.O.)|"I was born near the end of the
millennium, the year 1997.  My
father used to say that people were
so afraid that the world was going
to end that they were willing it to
happen."|speech
23||"Her father sits beside her mother on the living room couch,
watching the news.  From the look on their faces, the news is
bad."|stage direction
24|EVEY (V.O.)|"I don't remember much of the
century's turn.  I don't remember
the market crash or the plague or
any of the Trafalgar riots."|speech
25||"The television flickers with images of heavily armed soldiers
fighting in a shelled city."|stage direction
26|EVEY (V.O.)|"I've read about them since but I
don't recall how any of them
impacted my life except for the
fear.  They would hide it from me,
like a secret between them."|speech

take hold of each other's hand, clasping them tight."|stage direction

there is one thing I do remember."|speech

she can hear it."|stage direction
33|EVEY (V.O.)|"Very clearly, I can remember that
sound."|speech
34||We hear them, hundreds of marching soldiers.|stage direction

leather that gleamed bright in the
morning sun.  I had never seen such
boots.  All moving in perfect
unison."|speech

father's leg, staring as row after row of boots march by with
military precision."|stage direction

return to a bygone age, an age of
tradition, an age of values that
have been disparaged and all but
forgotten.  What this country needs
is a leader!  A true leader to
remind us of that age.  A righteous
leader with the strength of his
moral convictions to do what must
be done.  I give you that man!  I
give you our leader!  Adam Susan!"|speech
40||"Adam Susan rises and the crowd cheers.  Evey's father looks
at her mother and again they clasp hands."|stage direction
41|EVEY (V.O.)|"It must have seemed so easy to
them.  They offered such a simple

restore order."|speech

Liberals."|speech
45||A loud crash of splintering wood wakes her up.|stage direction

48|LITTLE EVEY|Mommy?|speech
49||"Her bedroom door bursts open and a heavily armed soldier

soldiers.  On the floor of the living room, she sees her
parents being bound with plastic zip-ties."|stage direction

daughter!"|speech

60||"A gay man is dragged violently from his Piccadilly home.
Outside, he sees his lover being forced to the cobblestones."|stage direction

bloody."|stage direction

someone else.  Someone different."|speech

what was happening, who knew it was
wrong but who kept silent."|speech
68||"A young detective named Finch looks down as the van pulls
away.  When he looks up, another man in a military uniform
whose name is Almond is watching him."|stage direction

order was imposed."|speech

71||EXT.  STREET|location
72||Again, we see the marching boots.|stage direction
73|EVEY (V.O.)|"Order that was like those boots,
order that required rigorous
discipline.  Order that is exactly

After a moment, we hear the hiss of spray paint."|stage direction

the year 2019 and this is the voice
of Fate broadcasting on 275 and 285
of the medium wave."|speech
82||"Beneath the loudspeaker is a surveillance system labeled,
""For your protection.""
Bubble eyed lenses iris at the end of stalks that move,
insect-like, racheting and clicking as they watch a little
girl pedal her bicycle.  The little girl glances nervously
over her shoulder up at the mechanical eyes watching her."|stage direction

quarantine zones as of today."|speech
87||"Evey is now a young woman.  She slips into a dress that is

96||INT.  SHADOW GALLERY|location
97||"We move over a dressing bureau, past a wig and over a pair of
black leather gloves, moving until we find the mask; it is
like something from the masquerade ball of another era.  It
has an exaggerated goatee, harlequin cheeks and a smile,
forever fixed, at once be-guiling and be-deviling."|stage direction

women, are currently in detention

together that night.  I had never
been to that part of Westminster

stopped believing in coincidence."|speech
110||EXT.  CITY STREET|location
111||Evey looks up and sees a man standing mostly in shadow.|stage direction
112|EVEY|"Excuse me?  Uh... excuse me,
Mister?"|speech
113||The man turns around.  It is not V.|stage direction
114|EVEY|"Would you like... uh, would you
like to sleep with me?"|speech

steel."|stage direction
149|FINGERMAN 1|He's got a knife!|speech
150||"V attacks and at once we know this is no normal human being.
A single blow sends the largest of the Fingermen flying
backwards.
But more than his strength, it is his speed.
A gun is cocked but before the hammer falls, a knife is
buried in the Fingerman's chest and --
Before the body falls, the knife is gone.
It takes a handful of seconds and three bodies lay on the
ground.  V turns to the last Fingerman who is struggling to
pull his pants up."|stage direction
151|FINGERMAN 3|Jesus Christ!  Don't hurt me!|speech

Evey, I am a performer."|speech
171|EVEY|Is that why you're wearing a mask?|speech

begun."|speech

faintly, we hear it."|stage direction
186|EVEY|I can't hear anything.|speech
187|V|"At first, you have to listen very
carefully..."|speech
188||"He continues to conduct and we begin to hear the music,
violins and horns that seem almost like a whisper or a wind
that steadily swells."|stage direction
189|V|"Ahh, yes.  There it is.  Beautiful,
is it not?"|speech
190||"He turns to the parapet, his gestures growing grander as the
music rises and we recognize Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture.
The music mounts a climax and V points the wand at Big Ben as
cymbals crash --
Big Ben explodes with such force the world seems to shake,
while --
V, smiling, always smiling, points again with another
crescendo and --
The statue of justice is blown to smithereens.
V nods in appreciation while mustering the music towards it's
finale as fireworks begin lighting up the sky."|stage direction
191|EVEY|Oh my...|speech
192||"Everywhere across the city, people stand transfixed by the
dazzling shimmer of the fireworks until --
A strobing final blitz leaves a single, starry image floating
in the smoke filled sky.
It is the letter V."|stage direction

197||"A massive modern building that is the seat of the new
government.
A long, black car pulls up to the entrance.  Adam Susan gets
out, wearing a long black trenchcoat over his pajamas.  He is
the Leader and he looks older, heavier, and meaner.
He hurries past the heavily armed guards, barely
acknowledging the snap and cock of their Nazi-like salute."|stage direction
198||INT.  LEADER'S OFFICE|location
199||"The Leader enters his main chambers and we see the Fate
computer system.
It is a cerebral cortex for a vast intelligence network.
Information can almost be felt coursing through its hard
drives.
The Leader sits, at once regaining a measure of composure.
He takes a deep calming breath and accesses the system.
Dozens of monitors fill with images from all across the city,
most of them are of the damage caused by V."|stage direction

now.  Mr. Heyer, speak for the Eye."|speech

desk inside the command center for the Eye, the governmental
organization responsible for the visual surveillance systems."|stage direction

usable footage, Leader.  It took

dispatch the Finger's vice patrol."|speech
203||"On an insert screen, we see grainy footage of V rescuing Evey
from one of the pole-mounted cameras."|stage direction
204|CONRAD|"As you can see, the suspect's
reflex speed is extraordinary.  As
is his strength."|speech

his shoulder straight into the camera."|stage direction

spooling reels of audiotape wind constantly."|stage direction
211|ETHERIDGE|"We were able to triangulate the
origin of the fireworks.  We also
are currently monitoring a lot of
phone surveillance indicating a
high percentage of conversation
concerned with the explosions.  All
suspect or significant transcripts
are being forwarded to Mr. Almond."|speech
212|LEADER|"Very good.  Mr. Finch, speak for
the Nose."|speech
213||"Finch, no longer the same young man, stands at the site of
the fireworks launch."|stage direction
214|FINCH|"Thanks to Etheridge, we found the
launch for the fireworks.  These
appear to be individually weighted
flares and we have found traces of
the same chemicals at both of the
detonation sites which leads us to
conclude that, despite a level of
sophistication, these devices are
all home-made with over the counter
chemicals, making them impossible
to trace.  Whoever he is, Leader,
he's good."|speech

annotation."|speech

is behind me?"|speech
221|ALMOND|"Uh... the Fate computer system,
sir?"|speech
222|LEADER|"No.  No sir.  It's more than that.
This, this computer is a symbol,
Mr. Almond.  A symbol of the
highest attainable goal of mankind.
Do you know what that goal is, Mr.
Almond?"|speech
223||"Almond does not.  The Leader leaps from his chair while
pounding the desk."|stage direction
224|LEADER|"Control, Mr. Almond!  Control!  The
world around us is a changing,
directionless, amoral morass and it
is up to man and man alone to set
things right!"|speech
225||He moves around the desk at Almond.|stage direction
226|LEADER|"Without control, man is nothing
more than any other stinking,
sweating, brute animal.  Control,
Mr. Almond.  The control that we
have painstakingly built up over
the last ten years.  Now, do you
understand what happened last
night?"|speech
227|ALMOND|We... lost control.|speech
228|LEADER|"Yes, Mr. Almond.  Last night
someone did the unthinkable.
Someone hurt us.  It is imperative

house to her."|stage direction
234|EVEY|Oh...|speech
235||"It is a labyrinth of interconnecting underground tunnels and
rooms.
The gallery is the main room as it is filled with an amazing
collection of human culture.  There is art that spans from
the renaissance to the painted covers of Eerie comics,
literature that ranges from Shakespeare to Spillane,
philosophy from Plato to Bukowski, and a vast collection of
nonfiction.
There are movie posters everywhere and an entire wall is
lined with videocassettes.
A jukebox stands in front of an enormous vinyl and CD
collection of music."|stage direction
236|EVEY|A jukebox?  Where did you get it?|speech
237|V|I saved it.  Like everything here.|speech
238||She punches a button and Billie Holiday begins to sing.|stage direction
239|EVEY|"Oh, it's beautiful.  I've never
heard anything like it."|speech
240|V|"Of course not.  You grew up in
their world.  Art is created by
individuals and there are no
individuals in a world where you
are told what to think."|speech
