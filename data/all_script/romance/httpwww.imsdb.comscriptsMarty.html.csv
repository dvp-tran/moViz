2||"NEW YORK CITY, 187TH STREET. A SUMMER DAY
FADE IN:
Just east of Webster Avenue in the North Bronx, 187th Street
is a predominantly Italian community and the commercial avenue
of the neighborhood. Fruit and vegetable stands, pizzerias,
butcher shops, bakeries, cleaners and dyers and bars flourish.
It is Saturday morning around eleven o'clock -- a market
day.
WOMEN, dark, gesticulative, with bulging cloth shopping bags,
baby carriages. MERCHANTS at their improvised street stands,
hawking their wares, disputing with their CUSTOMERS, roaring
salutations to PASSERSBY.
In the midst of all this, CAMERA HOMES IN on a typical
neighborhood...
BUTCHER SHOP.
Delicatessens hang on the walls, wreathed with garlands of
garlic. PATSY, the boss, a swarthy man of sixty, is flopping
a chunk of beef onto the scale for the benefit of a forty-
year-old MATRON. There are three or four other WOMEN in the
shop, all talking to one another. A four-year-old BOY lazily
chases a cat.
The white refrigerator room door opens, and a second butcher,
MARTY PILLETTI, comes out carrying a large leg of lamb. Marty
is a mildmannered, short, stout, balding man of thirty-four.
His charm lies in an almost indestructible good humor. He
drops the leg of lamb onto the chopping block, reaches up
for the cleaver hanging with the other utensils over the
block and makes quick incisive cuts into the leg of lamb. He
sets the cleaver aside, picks up the saw to finish the cuts
as he chats with his customer, MRS. FUSARI."|stage direction

Sunday, eh, Marty?"|speech

married Sunday, that was my little
brother, Nickie."|speech

Frances, she got married about two

FADE OUT.
FADE IN
NEW YORK CITY, WEST FARMS SQUARE. NIGHT
West Farms Square is a big street in the Bronx, filled with
stores, bowling alleys and bars. Cars push along between the
pillars of the elevated subway structure. The NOISE of the
subway trains ROARS by overhead every few moments.
CAMERA FINDS and ESTABLISHES the Stardust Ballroom. It
occupies the second floor of a large, dirty gray three-story
building. It is a hot June night, and the windows are open
for ventilation purposes. MUSIC manufactured by Dave
Greenglass and His Band blends with the NOISES of the street.
STARDUST BALLROOM. ENTRANCE VESTIBULE/STAIRS.
MUSIC plays in the background. CAMERA views CLARA, a plain
girl in her late twenties; her younger sister, MILLIE,
prettier; Millie's fiance ANDY, 30; and a second young man
DR. KEEGAN, also 30, who is a resident at Fordham Hospital.

STARDUST BALLROOM, ANTEROOM.
This is a small, carpeted lobby with TICKET TAKER in booth,
a cloak room and rest rooms. Painted posters on the walls
announce coming events and caution against smoking. There
are also large blow-ups of musicians who had played this
ballroom at one time and went on to bigger things. About six
or seven PEOPLE congregate in the lobby, engaged in various
indifferent activities.
CAMERA ANGLES include the swinging doors, as Clara, Andy,
Millie and Dr. Keegan come in. As they enter, the doors to
the ballroom proper are pushed out, and a GIRL in a black
dress, quite pretty, comes in. She starts across the anteroom

The dance floor is fairly dark. A romantic effect is achieved
by papier-mâché over the chandeliers. Around the walls are
the stag lines -- the MEN and waiting GIRLS. They stand singly

movement.
CAMERA DOLLIES slowly past the stag line, moving past faces,
short, fat, tall, thin stags. Some pretend indifference.
Some exhibit patent hunger.

the crush of people on the non-dancing margin of the dance
floor and slowly push their way toward the...

his old niche by the wall, leans there. A moment later, he
glances guardedly down to where the short girl and her friend
are.
MARTY'S P.O.V.: The Short Girl is approached by a dapper
young BOY who asks her to dance. She smiles, excuses herself
to her friend and follows the boy out onto the dance floor.
Marty stares at the Short Girl. He shrugs, he's used to this
kind of thing, then turns his attention bleakly back to
watching...
THE DANCE FLOOR.
The band starts up again and the MUSIC blares. It's a Lindy

312||"Dr. Keegan shrugs, moves down the line of stag guys. Marty
turns to watch him, still a little shocked at the proposition.
The Doctor approaches THREE STAGS and obviously broaches the
subject with one of them. This STAG seems more receptive to
the idea. Dr. Keegan takes out a wallet and gives the Stag a
five dollar bill. The Stag detaches himself from the wall
and, a little ill-at-ease, follows the Doctor.
Marty stands against the wall, watching the Doctor and the
Stag, who come in and move past him. Concerned and curious,
Marty stares after them, then moves out of his leaning
position, following in their general direction.
Marty moves through the crush of young men and women in the
area around the dance floor.
ALCOVE NEAR ARCHWAY.
As Marty reaches the alcove that separates the dance floor
proper from the lounge, he pauses and looks off toward the
booths.
LOUNGE.
Clara sits about halfway down the length of the booths. Dr.
Keegan and the Stag stand over her, talking to her. She is
looking up at them, her hands nervously gripping a Coca Cola
glass. Dr. Keegan is obviously introducing the Stag to Clara
and is going through some story about being called away on
an emergency. The Stag is presented as her escort-to-be, who
will see to it that she gets home safely.
Clara is not taken in by any of this, although she is trying
hard not to seem affected. She politely rejects the Stag's
company and will go home by herself, thanks for asking anyway.
Dr. Keegan makes a few mild protestations, and then he and
the Stag leave the booth and start back toward the archway.
ARCHWAY.
From where Marty stands, he can watch Clara, as well as Dr.
Keegan and the Stag. The Doctor and the Stag start past Marty,

he turns his attention toward Clara off-screen.
Clara is sitting as she was, gripping and ungripping the
glass of Coca Cola in front of her. Her eyes are closed.
Then, with a little nervous shake of her head she gets out
of the booth and stands momentarily at a loss for what next
to do. As she glances around, CAMERA ANGLES to include a
sign over an exit that reads ""Fire Escape."" Clara starts
moving toward that door.
Marty is staring off-screen toward Clara. He slowly works
his way down the length of the lounge in the general direction
of the fire escape.

Near the entrance to the fire escape, Clara comes into view.
Background sounds continue steadily.
Marty is walking the length of the lounge and suddenly stops

Clara disappears through the exit onto the fire escape

Marty watches. Then he continues on, crossing the threshold
of the...
FIRE ESCAPE.
It is sizeable, almost a small balcony. It looks out onto
the backs of innumerable five-story apartment houses. Clara
is standing by the railing, her back toward the camera, her
head sunk down. She is crying. Marty watches her for a moment

Marty takes her to him.
They stand in an awkward embrace, Marty a little embarrassed,
looking back through the fire escape doors to the lounge,
wondering if anybody is seeing them. He reaches back with
one hand, and contrives, with some effort, to push one of
the heavy iron doors shut. He returns his hand around the

understand. I used to see them

man, because he was so kind. That's
one of the most beautiful things I
have in my life, the way my father

thought maybe I go to college under
the G.I. Biller Rights, you know?
But I wouldn't graduate till I was
twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old,
even if I made it in three years.
And my brother Freddie wanted to get
married, and I had three unmarried
sisters -- in an Italian home, that's
a terrible thing. And my kid brother
Nickie, he's a one got married last
week. So I just went to pieces. I
used to walk inna streets till three,
four o'clock inna mornings. My mother
used to be so worried about me. My
uncle Mario come over one time. He
offered me a job driving his hack
onna night shift. He got his own
cab, you know. And God forgive me
for what I'm gonna say now, but I
used to thinka doing away with myself.
I used to stand sometimes in the

come out there. So it's a nice little
shop. I handle his books for him, so
I know he has a thirty-five percent
markup which is not unreasonable,
and he takes home net maybe a hundred,
hundred and fifty bucks a week. The
point is, of course, you gotta worry
about the supermarkets. There's two
inna neighborhood now, and there's
an A&P coming in, at least that's
the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade
is strictly Italian, but the younger
Italian girls, they get married, and
they don't stick to the old Italian
dishes so much. I mean, you gotta
take that into account too."|speech

to buy this shop, Marty."|speech

have to take outta loan inna bank
eight thousand dollars. That's a big
note to carry, because I have to

off in the end more than I can make
