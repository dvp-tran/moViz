scroll. Po is oblivious to the effects of crashing down
stairs and in slow motion, his voluminous butt presses down
on Tai Lung's head. As they crash through the Gateway the
scroll is knocked loose. Tai Lung goes for the scroll but Po
snatches it away using a noodle lasso. The scroll flies
towards him and bounces off his head. Tai Lung leaps for it,
but Po grabs his tail and pulls him back down onto a cart
which see-saws Po into the air. In mid-air, Po slurps the
noodle.
Up and over the rooftops, Po lands in a grove of bamboo trees
and into a nearby wok shop. The scroll rolls to a stop in the
street.
As Tai Lung makes his move on the scroll, Po turns the array
of overturned woks into a shell game, sliding the woks around
to hide the scroll."|stage direction

uses his bamboo stilts to block Tai Lung. The leopard swipes
out the stilts and brings Po down on top of him as the scroll
rolls down the steps towards the river.
Po gets thrown into a fireworks booth. As Tai Lung chases
down the scroll, he turns back to see Po flying through the
fireworks-filled sky.
Po slams through Tai Lung and crashes into a rock wall. The
scroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an
ornamental rooftop dragon. He looks back at Tai Lung, who
sees where the scroll has landed. Via the magic of cookie-
vision, Po effortlessly scales the building. Tai Lung is
shocked."|stage direction

punch.

impact crater."|stage direction

come back and strike Tai Lung, sending the leopard crashing

he just did.
Tai Lung rises from the rubble and runs at Po again. But Po
strikes back, using an unorthodox panda-style technique, even
getting Tai Lung to chomp down on his own tail. Po gives Tai
Lung a butt bump that sends him crashing into a building. Tai
Lung emerges and attempts one more lunge at Po. But Po
prepares... and Tai Lung is swiftly met by Po's IRON BELLY!
