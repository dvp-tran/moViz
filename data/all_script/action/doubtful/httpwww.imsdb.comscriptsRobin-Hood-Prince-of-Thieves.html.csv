3||"FADE IN:
SUNSET
The glowing orb ripples like a blood-red eye.
BLACK, ROBED FIGURE
A face of the ages. Dark, wrinkled skin. Wizened,
almond eyes. He howls at the sun. His voice ECHOES
across the sky. The Moslem call to prayer.
Hundreds of feet below his tower, a mud-walled city of
minarets and mosques. A human ants' nest. Scurrying to
their devotions."|stage direction
4||"EXT. TWELFTH-CENTURY ARAB CITY - ESTABLISHING SHOT
INT. DUNGEONS - SUNSET"|location
5||"Pervasive blackness. Moans of men in pain. Dripping
water. Rats. Filth. The nadir of human degradation.
Bedraggled white men, POWs from the Crusades, caged
together with Arab cutthroats. Jailers wrench two
crusaders from their cell. ROBIN OF LOCKSLEY and PETER
DUBOIS. Their appearance reeks of long imprisonment, but
remnants of their noble heritage still glimmer in their
faces. Peter is so frail he can barely walk."|stage direction
6||INT. TORTURE CHAMBER - SUNSET|location
7||"A furnace. Torture instruments glow red hot. Chained
victims. A massive INTERROGATOR scrutinizes the two
white men. Indicates a rat-faced lowlife, who points at
Peter, jabbering in Arabic."|stage direction

18|INTERROGATOR|"Sacrifice for the weaker? How
noble... As you wish... Cut off
this one's hand as well!... But
first..."|speech
19||"He indicates an Arab prisoner, who is dragged forward.
His struggling hand is laid on the executioner's block."|stage direction
20|INTERROGATOR|Show them the courage of Allah.|speech
21||"The prisoner's face braces for the pain. A red-hot
scimitar flashes down. The hand flips into a basket.
Twitching.
Robin is next. His composure fails. He flops to his
knees, crying. The Interrogator laughs. The jailers
unlash the thongs on Robin's hand. They stretch it out,
forcing it down. Robin goes limp, sobbing. Peter
catches his eye... Robin winks.
The scimitar. Drawn from the coals. Spitting flame.
Arcs down. Robin is suddenly galvanized."|stage direction
22|ROBIN|And this is English courage.|speech
23||"He hurls his holders aside. Swings upward, driving his
fast into the executioner's throat. Grabs the sword.
Slash. His thongs melt like butter. A jailer leaps at
him. Steaming, the scimitar slices into the man's chest.
Despite his bindings, Peter wrestles the Interrogator.
Knife pressed to his throat, Peter is forced against the
furnace. At the last second, he flips the man into the
fire. Screaming."|stage direction

the wall.
Peter frees himself, but they are still outnumbered.
While fighting, Robin acknowledges the man who shouted
the warning. An imposing, shaven-headed SARACEN.
Heavily-muscled arms and chest, covered in tattoos. Even
his bald head is ornamented."|stage direction

him, thrusting a blazing torch at his face. The Saracen
intercepts the blow. Grabs the man's neck, SNAPPING it
with one mighty twist."|stage direction
71||(coughing)|unknown
72|PETER|Thanks. I misjudged you.|speech
73|SARACEN|Save your breath.|speech
74||"Gasping for air, they find the tunnel veers steeply down-
ward. A slippery, granite tube. Losing purchase, they
slide headlong. Sharp, rusted spikes jut out from the
walls ahead.
Robin grabs at the walls to break the fall. No use.
They're picking up speed. He turns his sword crossways,
bracing it against the sides of the tunnel, as a brake.
Sparks fly. The sword cuts into Robin's chest... but it
works."|stage direction
75|SARACEN|Allah be praised.|speech
76|ROBIN|Amen, brother.|speech
77||"A bloodcurdling scream. A pursuing guard tumbles down
the sewer chute. The three men press themselves against
the wall. The man hurtles by... is impaled on the
spikes.
A draft of fresh air from the roof of the tunnel. Using
the spiked guard as a ladder, Robin climbs. Removes a
grating."|stage direction

tion of the voice... Grey. Proud. Distinguished. LORD
LOCKSLEY.
Seated at a table, wine goblet in hand, he pores   over a
wonderful illustrated Bible. Reading to himself    for
solace and strength. Empty chairs surround the    vast
table. A deep sense of loneliness. He glances     at a
portrait over the fireplace... Robin.
The dog jumps. Hackles rise. O.S. SHOUTS. Locksley
unsheathes a dagger. Obscures it in the folds of the

173|KENNETH|Nearby the Gregor Caves.|speech
174||"Locksley reacts -- a hint of fear. They move on...
Ahead, the hillside glows, rimmed in eerie light.
Strange primitive CHANTS, wafted on the wind. Locksley
ties his nervous horse to a tree.
Parting undergrowth, Kenneth creeps forward. Cries out.
He's face to face with the maggot-eaten skull of a goat.
Beyond it, a gruesome host of half-skinned human skulls,
all arranged on stakes. Some male, others with rotting
female tresses, staring eyelessly into the night.
Kenneth turns to run... A hand grabs him."|stage direction
175|LOCKSLEY|"Steady, man. They are to dissuade
the faint of heart. Think of
Gwen."|speech
176||"From the crest of the rise, they peer down into the
craggy valley. A cave opening, ablaze with flames leers
at them like the mouth of hell. Before the cave, a
circle of stones. A miniature Stonehenge.
A medieval orgy. Men and women in masks and loose
robes. Dancing. Drinking. Reveling. Pure carnality.
Lord Locksley and Kenneth watch in horror. Faces ashen."|stage direction

a century ago."|speech
179||"An unearthly SCREECH. A creature leaps into the circle
of stones. Grotesque gargoyle head, horns, fur-covered
arms and legs. A living Hieronymous Bosch DEMON. Its
clawed hands slash across a reveler's back, drawing
blood in vicious streaks. The creature tastes the blood.
The reveler is ecstatic."|stage direction

181|KENNETH|Is it the devil?|speech
182|LOCKSLEY|"If it is, I have some Christian

186|LOCKSLEY|Gwen?|speech
187||"Kenneth nods.
The Demon shrieks, dervishing around GWEN, who  is
carried onto the central plinth stone. A pagan   altar,
the shape of an elephant's head with its trunk  raised. A
masked figure stands at the head of the altar.   The high
priest of the dark rite.
The girl's body shudders as blood-red liquid is forced
down her throat. The Demon's voice is husky and hideous."|stage direction
188|DEMON|Come, my virgin flower.|speech
189||"Hypnotized by the creature's voice and snake-like move-
ments, Gwen stretches herself out. A single beam of
sunlight slices through the mist, like a laser. The
first light of the rising sun, it strikes directly on the
altar, tracking down towards the girl's heart. The
Demon's raised talons close in on the white flesh of her
neck. Gwen's eyes are open wide, in a trance. The crowd
of revelers encircle the plinth. Awed anticipation...
A warrior's yell!
Sword raised, Locksley THUNDERS in on his CHARGER. The
terrified crowd parts. The Demon screams like a banshee."|stage direction

191|DEMON|Kill him!   Kill him!|speech
192||"The followers throw themselves at   Locksley. He beats
them off. The high priest issues    orders to armed guards,
who run to intercept. One aims a    spear. Locksley hacks
the shaft in half. Cuts men down    left and right.
Reaches the altar stone."|stage direction
193||LOCKSLEY|unknown
194|DEMON|Gwen!   Up, girl, up!|speech
195||"Gwen shakes off her trance. The Demon launches itself at
Locksley. Talons rip flesh from his face. With all his
strength, Locksley hurls the creature down."|stage direction
196|LOCKSLEY|In the name of God!|speech
197||"His broadsword swings in a mighty arc. Slices across the
gargoyle's skull. Clean through half the face...
Impossibly, the demon rolls back to its feet."|stage direction

199||"CONTINUED:
The head is an elaborate mask -- beneath are the yellow
skin, white hair, and burning red eyes of an albino
crone. Screaming vitriol, the hag is unharmed.
Momentarily stunned, Locksley regains his senses, hauls
the girl onto his charger. The guards close in.
Locksley spurs his horse. Rides for an opening.
The masked high priest stands resolutely in his path.
Brandishing a burning branch. The horse is freaked.
Rears. Locksley and the girl are thrown.
Unarmed, Locksley charges the man. Slams him into the
cave wall. The mask falls. Locksley gasps in
recognition."|stage direction
