thinking. He wears a suit and tie. He seems relaxed and
confident. Content. Completely in his element.
In one of his hands he's absentmindedly twirling a couple of
individually-wrapped Ricola throat lozenges. We hear the
muffled voice of someone on a PA system outside:

--David finishes a speech at the FDNY Academy's graduation.
The cadets jump to their feet and give him a standing
ovation.
--David shakes the hands of workers entering a .Con Edison

politicians he actually seems to enjoy campaigning.
--Flashbulbs go off as he plays a game of pick-up basketball
with a group of Bronx teenagers. Charlie is nearby.
--David takes a ceremonial shovel full of dirt to begin
redevelopment of an old military base upstate.
--He gives a speech at a Harlem church. Audiences watch
David the way they watched JFK, the way they watch Obama
today. He inspires, makes them believe, makes them want to
follow him. Especially young people.
--David walks through a suburban mall happily shaking hands
as cameras follow him and citizens snap pictures with their
camera-phones. People crush around him. He:doesn't seem to
mind at all. He welcomes it. He feeds off it.
--He pops a cherry lozenge in his mouth and climbs up onto a
tractor to speak to a gathering of upstate farmers, speaking
