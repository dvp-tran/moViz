29||"Jack ain't exactly Cary Grant, but any guy wearing
a tux on these streets doesn't exactly mesh with
the milieu.  Pausing for a flask of whiskey at an
all-night liquor store, he breaks the seal before
he hits the sidewalk and moves on, drinking as he
goes.  Finally, he comes to a nice downtown hotel.
Slipping the bottle in his coat, he squints up at
the glittering building as if sizing up an opponent."|stage direction

hair.  Come on, we're on."|speech

exasperation."|stage direction

69|JACK|"Careful, Frank.  When you get angry your
tie starts to spin."|speech
70||"Jack steps into the lounge and Frank, shaking his
head, follows.  As they move away, a cardboard
stand-up is revealed.  On it are two 8 X 10 glossies
of Frank and Jack, and below printed in bold letters,
this: ""Tonight!  The Doubly Delightful Tones of the
Fabulous Baker Boys!""
BAKER BROTHERS
as they make their way through the dimly-lit lounge
and settle behind matching pianos, it becomes apparent
that what the ""Fabulous Baker Boys"" are, in fact, is a
poor man's version of Ferrante and Teicher.
WIDER ANGLE INCLUDING LOUNGE
As they begin to plink out their ""theme song"" tables
of middle-aged couples sipping enormous banana
daiquiries begin to tap their feet and bob their heads.
After a few bars, the boys finish with a flourish and
the couples applaud."|stage direction

77||Applause.|stage direction
78|FRANK|"That's a lot of water under the
bridge, eh, Jack?"|speech
79|JACK|Lotta water.|speech
80|FRANK|"Of course, back then, things were a little
different.  I was eight, Jack was seven, just
about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie
Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would
listen to us was the family cat, Cecil."|speech
81||(to Jack)|location
82|FRANK|"We must have shaved three lives off that cat,
eh, Jack?"|speech
83||"Laughter. Jack smiles like he's got a mouth full of
razor blades."|stage direction
84||(continuing)|location
85|FRANK|"But seriously.  It's been fifteen years since
Jack and I first stepped on the stage as
professionals. Three states, sixty-eight cities,
and more-grayhairs-then-we'd-like-to-admit later...
well, believe me, we've seen our share of this
crazy country of ours.  But even though we've
played some of the finest venues in the world ..."|speech

place, the Starfire lounge."|speech

disease."|stage direction

him in the kitchen with Hector and the soup bone."|stage direction
123|LLOYD|"Only, Jack, do me a favor, will ya, pal?  If you
wanna smoke, put on a pair of sunglasses and go
play with the niggers on State Street.  These
blisters from the midwest don't wanna watch some
guy dripping ash all over himself while he's
playing 'The Sound of Music.'"|speech

Smoke curls out of Jack's nose.  He is utterly still,
like a pit bull eyeing a steak.
BACK TO SCENE"|stage direction
125|LLOYD|Okay, boys, that ought to buy you a few more|speech

182||"Jack's apartment is small, old, and comfortably
cluttered.  The most striking item is a vintage phone
booth placed against the wall.  As Jack lets himself in,
EDDIE, the dog from the window, walks over.  He is not
an overly enthusiastic dog, but you can see from his
face that he has a great deal of affection for Jack."|stage direction

Johhny Appleseed the way you're dropping teeth
around here."|speech
187||"Jack hangs his tie on the phone booth and walks over
to an old phonograph stacked six deep with discs.
He lifts the records back up the post and clicks ON the
MACHINE.  As Bill Evans' smoky ""PEACE PIECE"" fills the
tiny apartment, Jack breaks the collar of his shirt and
walks over to the old piano near the window.  Settling
back with the bottle of whiskey, Jack rests his elbows
gently on the keys and stares out the open window,
listening to the music."|stage direction
188||INT.  PIANO STORE|location

I was looking at it just the other day.
Jesus, I thought he was gonna kill that cat."|speech

276|FRANK|Twenty years, Ma ...|speech
277|MRS. BAKER|"Yes, yes.  It's just that John is so much nicer.
Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl,
we had a pig on the farm named Jack.
I guess I just can't help making the association."|speech

holds his brother personally responsible for this."|stage direction

I have to set a few things up."|speech

284||INT.  HOUSE|location
285||"The front room is cluttered with his childhood.
Most noticeable are the pianos: two tiny uprights,
perfectly matched, their simulated ivory keys yellowed
with age.  Above them, pressed between glass and framed,
are the music ribbons, faded by twenty years of sunlight.
Finally, there is the sheet music, dusty and dog-eared,
piled everywhere in drunken stacks.
This and all else in the room Jack confronts slowly,
warily, but with a noticeable dispassion,
until his eyes fall upon a photograph.
In it, he and Frank are standing alonside a tall man
in baggy slacks, safe within the arc of his long arms.
Frank is staring straight into the camera, neat, clean,
perfectly posed, but Jack, a year younger,
his shirt too big, is caught in profile,
looking up at the tall man with an almost worshipful gaze."|stage direction

Frank?"|speech

293|MRS. BAKER|So. How are you?|speech
294|JACK|Fine.  You?|speech

Frank clicks on the projector and picks up his cake.
Mrs. Baker close on his elbow,
sets her plate on her knees and watches the screen.
Jack sits off to the side.
A title card appears:
""For Mrs. Ellie Baker, who made it all possible.""
Mrs. Baker gives Frank a puzzled look.
He just smiles.
Suddenly, images spring to the screen,
obviously footage several years old,
showing Jack and Frank as children,
sitting at the tiny pianos, wearing matching suits,
smiling matching smiles as they play for the camera."|stage direction
