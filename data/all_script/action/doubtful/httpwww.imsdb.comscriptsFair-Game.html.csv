In the run-up to the war with Iraq

Proliferation Division of the CIA,

affiliation with the CIA was

solid intelligence for senior
policy makers on Iraq 's presumed
weapons of mass destruction
program. While I helped to manage
and run secret worldwide operations
against this WMD target from CIA
headquarters in Washington , I also
traveled to foreign countries on
secret missions to find vital
intelligence. I loved my career
because I love my country."|unknown
