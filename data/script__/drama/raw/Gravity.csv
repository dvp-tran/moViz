PLANET EARTH.
Like all images of Earth seen from space, this image of our
planet is mythical and majestic.
The globe seems almost tangible, slowly spinning, floating in
the endless void of space. It is a blue planet, and bright white
clouds twirl and stretch in capricious patterns across the deep
blue of the oceans and the jigsaw of continents: green, yellow
and brown.
It is noon in Cape Town and early night in India.
The sphere is almost a perfect orb except for the darkened
sliver on its Eastern edge.
It is beautiful! And so full of life.
But not here.
Here it is completely silent."|stage direction

13||"IN THE DISTANCE-
A small metal object crosses the empty space surrounding Earth.
If it appears to be a small satellite that is only because it is
far away from us. It is the size of one football field. It is-
The INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS).
It resembles a dragonfly. Its solar panels stretch out, like
wings, from the long body made of connected pressurized modules.
It floats with a sense of proud achievement.
It orbits at an altitude of 500 km above sea level. It moves at
an average of 27,700 kilometers per hour, completing 15.7 laps
around the Earth per day.
It is cruising over Zimbabwe. To the East, the island of
Madagascar. Up to the North, the expansive dry lands of Somalia
and Ethiopia.
Soon, the ISS curves around the spherical planet, and it becomes
smaller, almost indistinguishable, no more than a small bright
spec grazing over the blue atmosphere.
CLOSER TO US-
Orbiting at an altitude of 600 km-
The EXPLORER SPACE SHUTTLE becomes visible.
This icon of space exploration has played a key role in all of
NASA's missions since the late 90's.

The broken piece of the arm SPINS AWAY from the Explorer at a
great speed with Ryan attached to it. She passes next to-
THE HUBBLE as a big piece of debris hits the telescope. The top
of the cylinder explodes into more debris, which is expelled in
all directions, barely missing Ryan as she spins away attached
to the arm.

THE EARTH,
Very still and very distant. Night is creeping across the sphere

time something arrests her gaze:
A LAMINATED PHOTOGRAPH floats next to Shariff, tethered to his
suit via a small chain. In it, a YOUNG BOY LAUGHS with abandon,
happy in the embrace of a man unseen save for his TWO STRONG

607||"Nothing more than a dot.
She stretches her hand toward him, as if trying to touch him
with the tips of her fingers. But the dot has already vanished
into never-ending darkness.
EVERYTHING IS BLURRED.
Ryan is about to lose consciousness, when-
A new ALARM GOES OFF.
She takes one deep breath as she opens her eyes widely.
If she doesn't move, she'll die.
Ryan pulls herself forward, reaching for a handle on the Soyuz.
She grabs it and reaches for another, climbing her way toward
the Station's airlock.
But she's losing focus.
As her right hand is reaching for a handle, everything becomes a
blur, and she misses.
INSIDE THE HELMET -
Her brain is shutting down from lack of oxygen. She struggles to
open her eyes and mumbles words that are unintelligible.
She reaches up again, almost blindly. Her hand grips the handle,
and with one huge effort-
She sprints across the Docking Module, swinging from handle to
handle, in one continual push, until she reaches the-
AIRLOCK.
She stops, takes one deep breath and-
She turns the latch and OPENS the re-entry hatch.
The hatch BLOWS OPEN as the air inside the cabin escapes into
the vacuum, almost throwing Ryan back into space, but she holds
tightly onto the latch.
She hangs outside, trying to gasp the last breath of oxygen
inside her life system. She sees her feet dangling against the
emptiness of space and-
With one last effort, she pulls herself into the airlock.
AIRLOCK MODULE. INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION. 500 KM ABOVE EARTH.
As she enters she does a 180-degree flip. As soon as her legs
are in, she grabs onto the latch, and-
CLOSES THE HATCH.
She turns the latch and-
THE CABIN IS SEALED OFF.
INSIDE THE HELMET-
Ryan is suffocating. With very little oxygen and her body
intoxicated by the nitrogen in her blood, her breathing is
coarse and painful.
She can hardly keep her eyes open, and she pushes herself
through the cabin, an empty cylinder lit by two circular mercury
lights. She reaches the-
CONTROL PANEL, a small computer with a screen that monitors the
atmospheric and temperature levels inside the airlock.
She presses a button on the panel and-
THE CABIN BEGINS TO PRESSURIZE.
A low hissing sound can be heard as the tanks in the Station
begin pumping pure oxygen into the airlock. The control panel's
monitor shows the atmospheric levels slowly rising.
INSIDE THE HELMET-
Ryan gasps for air, but there is none.
She stares at the red-orange-green graph on the control panel
showing the atmospheric levels. It reads red. Her pupils begin
to dilate as-
SOUND BEGINS TO SURFACE-
In the vacuum of space there was nothing to carry sound waves,
but now sound begins to travel through the oxygen that slowly
fills the cabin.
The sounds are muffled, like the sounds of the outside world
heard from within the womb.
A beeping sound intermittently penetrates the airlock, anxious
and halting.
The Control System's graph slowly moves from red to orange. The
cabin is still not fully pressurized.
But that will have to do.
With one sharp motion-
SHE TAKES OFF HER HELMET-
And pushes it from her head.
She gasps for air and coughs.
She contorts and shakes, fighting to breath in the thin
atmosphere of the airlock. Her helmet bounces around the walls
of the cabin, floating.
The beeping sound has become clearer and recognizable - it is an
alarm ringing out across the Station.
Orange is turning to green. Her lungs begin to absorb the oxygen
and her breath becomes more even. Her body floats, relaxed in
the confined space of the airlock.
SHE FLOATS.
Ryan brings her hands together and removes one glove.
And then the other.
Desperately, she begins to unscrew the lock near her waist. She
squirms under the suit and pushes off the upper half.
Then she throws off the lower half, squirming out of it as if
shedding her old skin, desperate to free herself from the
claustrophobia of the suit.
Wearing only underwear and a t-shirt, she floats in mid-air,
relieved and exhausted. The hum of the Space Station surrounds
her.
Then, slowly, she pulls her knees to her chest and enfolds them
in her arms, floating in a fetal position.
For a moment, Ryan simply hangs in suspension, a fly in amber,
surrendering to the poetry of the planets, rotating slowly in
the cabin's womb.
OUTER SPACE. 500 KM ABOVE THE EARTH.
SILENCE.
The International Space Station, with its modules, its torn
solar panels, and the Soyuz with its parachute billowing out

The Station looks frail and secluded, lost somewhere between the
grandness of the Heavens and the Earth below.
Everything is still.

The HATCH of the Soyuz OPENS.
Ryan comes out of the craft into space. She's wearing the space
suit she packed and she carries a large bag.
She holds onto handles as she floats, SAFELY TETHERED to the
inside of the cabin.
She LOOKS around-
The International Space Station is a looming presence floating
ten meters below. It is pulling the Soyuz by its parachute.
An ALARM on her STOPWATCH RINGS. It's been 85 MINUTES.
She turns the alarm off and looks around."|stage direction

satellite debris."|speech

Melody that Matt had played earlier.
She begins to climb around the vessel. With plenty of oxygen in
her pressurized suit, this is not a difficult task.
She pulls herself from handle to handle, making her way around
the Soyuz and reaching-
THE PARACHUTE CONTAINER-
An impact has blown open the cover. Three ropes float out of the
container into space. Three meters away from the vessel each
rope branches into dozens of parachute strings. Next to it-
A second cover is also badly damaged.
Harnessing herself to a handle, she inspects the ropes. The
three ropes are bolted to the container's frame."|stage direction
694|RYAN (CONT'D)|"Okay. We detach this and we go home.
Piece of cake."|speech

She unzips the bag and takes out the PISTOL GRIP tool, without
noticing that behind her-
DOZENS OF PIECES OF DEBRIS pass, zooming less than thirty meters
away from the Station.
A tiny piece of high-speed debris crashes against one of the
Station's Solar panels, shattering it and causing the Station to
tremble.
She places the tool against the FIRST BOLT, stretching her arm
into the parachute container. It is an awkward position.
She pulls the trigger and the drill rotates, turning the bolt,
but it slides out of the notch.
She places the tool once more against the bolt and pulls the
trigger. The drill rotates, SLOWER this time.
She HUMS under her breath and SWEAT begins to drop down her
forehead.
She is very focused, unaware that behind her-
DEBRIS HITS THE STATION'S SOLAR PANEL, piercing holes through
it.
THE BOLT COMES OFF.
As it FLOATS OFF into space, Ryan drops the PISTOL GRIP and uses
both hands to detach the rope from the frame.
The ROPE FLOATS away from the Soyuz, undulating like a long
snake, but-
Ryan notices that the Pistol Grip is also floating away.
She stretches her arm trying to catch it, but it is out of her
reach.
She pushes herself towards the pistol grip, and barely manages
to grab onto it when she sees-"|stage direction
696|RYAN (CONT'D)|Oh shit.|speech

She pulls herself back to the container.
DEBRIS HITS THE STATION.
It CRASHES in SILENCE against one of its modules, creating a
hole the size of a car wheel. The vacuum sucks BLUE FLAMES from
the station that quickly die without oxygen to consume.
Ryan brings the pistol-grip to the SECOND BOLT and pulls the
trigger. The bolt spins.
Ryan is HUMMING louder and louder.
Ryan stares intently at the head of the bolt turning as the
debris zooms by behind her.
THE SECOND BOLT COMES OFF.
She quickly pulls the rope loose from the frame and lets it
float away.
Shaken by the impacts, the Space Station drags the Soyuz with
it.
She braces herself as-
DEBRIS WREAKS HAVOC- some pieces hit the Station, others crash
against one another. Each collision creates more debris that
ricochet and fly away in all directions.
The Soyuz is pulled by the remaining parachute rope, as the
Station spins out of control.
Ryan starts humming even louder, the bravado is full tilt now.
Her face is now covered in sweat, which pours into her eyes,
making it difficult to see as she unscrews the last bolt.
Behind her, a cluster of debris PIERCES THE PARACHUTE.
Ryan continues drilling as-
MORE DEBRIS HIT THE STATION.
It CRASHES against the Japanese Lab, which silently EXPLODES
into millions of pieces. The pieces expand away from the
Station.

collapsing Space Station.

colliding with additional debris, the fragments glimmer
magnificently then join...
...the THINNING TIDE OF DEBRIS orbiting toward the dark side of
