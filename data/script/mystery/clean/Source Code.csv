He blinks. A stunned beat. He's disoriented.
Slowly he turns his head to one side...
PASSENGERS. Filling most of the seats. Office workers on
their morning commute into a city.
Turning the other way, he's confronted with a window. Trees
flash by, splitting the rising sunlight into a hypnotic
strobe pattern.
Colter looks to be thirty years old. A military buzz cut. A
disciplined physique, lean and spare, almost gaunt. Skin
burnished by years of desert sandstorms and equatorial sun.
His expression, prematurely aged by combat, is perpetually
wary, sometimes predatory, accustomed to trouble.
Despite his military bearing, Colter wears a button down
shirt and navy sports coat. On his wrist is a digital watch.
It reads 7:40 a.m.
He swallows. A strange, creeping panic.
He has no idea where he is."|speech|SOURCE CODE|F|

starting to freak him out.
He catches the scent of something. A passenger walks by with
a STEAMING CUP OF COFFEE.
CHK-THOCK! Two rows back, an OVERWEIGHT MAN opens a can of
soda.
Sitting opposite Colter, facing him, is a WOMAN in her late
twenties (CHRISTINA). In contrast to the corporate suits
around her, her appearance is thrift store funky: black nail
polish, dark lipstick, black hair with blue streaks, a button-

At the passing woodland scenery.
He's back on the train. Back in the same navy sports coat.
Across from him, Christina is at work on her sketch pad.
Just like before. Other commuters all around him.
Everything is exactly the same as before.
Note: The remaining story will follow this ""binary pattern.""ù
Scenes will take place either on the train or in the capsule.
Compared to tomb-like isolation chamber he just came from,
the train is exploding with sensory input -- the smell of
steaming coffee, the cramped proximity of other passengers,
the crinkle of an freshly-ironed dress shirt, the glint of a
buckle on a purse, the slanting sunlight, the trees out the
window, bursting with summer leaves.
Almost unintentionally, Colter finds himself repeating the
same opening actions as last time -- checking his watch (7:40
a.m.)... turning at the scent of passing coffee... peeking in
the canvas messenger bag beside him...
This time, however, he takes the books out of the messenger
bag. The books are stamped ""NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY.""ù
He also takes out the APPLE. Sniffs it. Takes a bit. It's
good. No, it's awesome. Crisp and delicious.

Is Goodwin watching him from somewhere?
Not knowing what else to do, he takes a few more bites.
Enjoying this small pleasure.
He reaches in his sports jacket pocket and pulls out his
TRAIN TICKET.

Sudden dizziness. He grabs a seatback for support. Sensory

A terrifying silence.
The SNAP of a harness releasing. A THUD as Colter falls to
the floor of the capsule. Cursing. Some sounds of thrashing
around. Then...
The SPARK of a BLUE FLARE illuminates Colter's face. He's
activated a miniature signal light on his flight suit. It
begins to BLINK. Like a beacon for downed pilots afloat in
the sea. It is the only light in the otherwise dead capsule.
Up on his knees, he grasps the release handles of the EXIT
HATCH. Using all his strength he TURNS...
But the handles don't budge. The hatch remains sealed.
He gets to his feet. Can't stand up fully. The capsule is
incredibly cramped.
Rifling through a cabinet, he discovers OPERATIONAL MANUALS
in small, almost illegible type. And a small set of TOOLS.
He spreads them out on the tiny ledge. Taking a wrench, he
BANGS on the escape hatch. A deep, clanging ECHO in the
hull.
44.
So, like any pilot would, he sets about repairing his craft.
At first he puzzles over the electronics and circuitry.
Daunted by the complexity.
There's no time to lose. Using a miniature screw driver, he
begins unscrewing the monitor panel. His fingers are slow
and clumsy in the frigid cold and the screw driver slips out

Another SPARK. It shocks him. There's a puff of blue smoke.
He's burned his fingers.
But the battery now has a tiny BLINKING GREEN LIGHT.
Working fast, Colter attaches the copper wires to the leads
on the battery. From inside the engines comes a faint
electric HUM.
FFFT. The monitor awakens. Like a film projector it throws
the image of a PLAYING CARD onto the opposite side of the
craft.
Colter begins replacing the monitor components. As he does,
a pre-recorded AUDIO FILE comes on:
GOODWIN (V.O.)
-- four principle dialects of
Arabic: Egyptian, Gulf, Syrian-
Lebanese and North African. We
will now play you portions of each,
discussing the audible differences
between them.
CLIPS of SPOKEN ARABIC begin to play.
Colter continues reconstituting the computer. The monitor
fills with scrolling lines of COMPUTER CODE.
With an oddly low-tech CLANG, the heart of the machine
reawakens. The air vents come back to life. Heat starts to
return. The icicles begin to DRIP.
45.
Colter sits back in his seat, exhausted from the work.
