1522|PROSECUTOR (CONT'D)|"Mr. Jung, can you describe the
circumstances of how you began talking
about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?"|speech|PROSECUTOR|?|
1523|GEORGE|"Shortly after I arrived at Danbury
Federal Correctional Institute I related
to Diego that the crime I was in for was
smuggling marijuana.
Diego told me he had high level
connections in Colombia and they needed
to find someone to help them transport
cocaine into America..."|speech|GEORGE|M|True
1524|GEORGE (CONT'D)|"The first run was fifteen kilos, which
we smuggled into Logan Airport in hard
shelled suitcases."|speech|GEORGE|M|True
1525|GEORGE (CONT'D)|"We wrapped the cocaine in kitchen
cabinet paper, and duct tape, that way
if there were any dogs in customs..."|speech|GEORGE|M|True
1526|GEORGE (CONT'D)|"I introduced Diego to a pilot named Jack
Stevens, who helped us fly 300 kilos of
cocaine per week into the United States
via twin-engine Cessnas.  Jack would fly
into North Carolina, we'd meet him there
and drive it down to different
distribution points..."|speech|GEORGE|M|True
1527|GEORGE (CONT'D)|"I never met Pablo Escobar.  Diego
Delgado was my only connection to
cocaine from Colombia..."|speech|GEORGE|M|True
1528|GEORGE (CONT'D)|"Diego convinced me to keep most of my
money in a Panamanian bank.  Diego had a
close relationship with Manuel Noriega.
In exchange for allowing us to keep our
money there, we paid him a percentage."|speech|GEORGE|M|True
1529|GEORGE (CONT'D)|"There was an 85% chance that if you
snorted cocaine between 1977-1984, it
was ours. Initially with my LA
connections, we invented the
marketplace.  In 1977, there was no
other real competition."|speech|GEORGE|M|True
1530|GEORGE (CONT'D)|"The first year we made about 100 million
dollars between us.  It was an expensive
operation.  Eventually we built up to
three different pilots doing multiple
runs per week, connections on both
coasts, everything was running smooth.
We were like a corporation..."|speech|GEORGE|M|True
1531|GEORGE (CONT'D)|"he was very anti-government.  He talked
about revolution, forming his own
country or island, he was looking for
power as well as money.  I was just
looking for money."|speech|GEORGE|M|True
1532|GEORGE (CONT'D)|"He disliked the United States, thought
it was a police state.  He hoped that by
flooding the country with cocaine, it
would disrupt the political system and
tear down the morality of the country."|speech|GEORGE|M|True
1533|GEORGE (CONT'D)|"Well, yes, Derek Foreal was my
connection, I met him back in 1968 when
I first moved to Manhattan Beach.  It
was Foreal's marijuana connections that
kicked off our cocaine market."|speech|GEORGE|M|True
1534|GEORGE (CONT'D)|"Yes, it was my idea to bring the kilos
to Los Angeles.  When Diego finally got
Derek Foreal's name from me, it was only
a matter of months before he'd cut me
out."|speech|GEORGE|M|True
1535|GEORGE (CONT'D)|"I'm not sure how my relationship with my
daughter and ex-wife have anything to do

1547|GEORGE|"I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no
chance of parole.  Even if they cut my
sentence in half I'll be seventy-three
years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I
don't know if the parole board, the
judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself

bad record, I'm not sure what's going to
happen."|speech|GEORGE|M|True
