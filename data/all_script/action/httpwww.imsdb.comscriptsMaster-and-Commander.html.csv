Written by
John Collee & Peter Weir
1. THE OCEAN - DUSK
From blackness, a pattern slowly emerges - shimmering,
abstract lines form into waves cresting above steep-sided
valleys of water.
Finally the picture settles into a high, wide shot of the
ocean and an adjacent coastline.
In a corner of the screen, the last rays of sunlight touch a
small, dark shape causing it to glow in the gathering
darkness: A three-masted sailing vessel.
2. THE SHIP - DUSK
[   ] She passes close enough to touch: hawsers as thick as a
man's trunk, massive black-painted timbers, muzzles of her
great guns projecting from every gun-port.
As the ship glides past and away from us, her name is
visible, picked out in dull gold on the transom - Surprise.
3. ANOTHER ANGLE - DUSK
The ship in silhouette - RUN CAPTION:"|unknown
1||"HMS Surprise
Armament: 28 guns Crew: 197 souls.
Location: Coast of Brazil, November 1806
Mission: Intercept and destroy French
Privateer, Acheron"|location
2||"5.   THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK
CAPTAIN JACK AUBREY, with his back to us, bends over the
table, studying charts.
His servant, KILLICK, a pig-tailed, ear-ringed man of
indeterminate age, refills the glass at his elbow.
JACK drinks. The glass catches the setting sun as it drops
below the great casement windows.
KILLICK lights a lamp, places it next to his captain and
retires."|unknown
3|JACK|(Absently) Thankee Killick|speech
4||"4. THE CHARTS:
a beautifully drawn chart of the South American coastline.
Jack's hands place a second chart on top of the first,
bringing the north-east coast of Brazil into view. Then
another, each one enlarging the view of the preceding one.
On the final chart we can read navigational symbols and
detailed information in fine copperplate script:"|unknown
5|JACK|"6 fa. Shoals suddenly to half fa. Rocks
(exact position unknown). Hidden reef."|speech
6||"6. BELOW DECKS - NIGHT
Another lamp illuminates 1st lieutenant TOM PULLINGS, his
pleasant open face marred by a diagonal sabre scar running
from brow to chin.
He is making a final tour of inspection before lights out."|unknown
7||"7. THE DOCTOR'S CABIN - NIGHT
Dr STEPHEN MATURIN, a keen naturalist, sits at his desk
surrounded by specimen jars, books and scientific
instruments.
TOM PULLINGS glances in as he moves past the cabin door, but
the doctor, placing weights on some finely-balanced
structure, is too engrossed to notice him.
8. MIDSHIPMAN'S BERTH - NIGHT
In the quarters for the 'young gentlemen', boys trained from
an early age to become officers, four lads play at marbles.
PETER CALAMY (16) and LORD BLAKENEY (13) are arguing about
whether a marble was inside outside the circle as their berth
mates BOYLE (15) and WILLIAMSON (14) wait for the game to
resume."|stage direction

13|BLAKENEY|In. Tell him Boyle. It was in I say.|speech
14||"The lamp moves on, illuminating a fifth midshipman, much
older than the rest. This is HOLLOM, aged 24. He's a
sensitive-looking fellow, idly strumming a guitar, glancing
up briefly as TOM PULLINGS passes.
9. GUN-DECK - NIGHT
By the galley stove at the forward end of the gun-deck a few
of the foremast hands enjoy a last smoke and a mug of grog.
Faster Doudle passes his mug to Higgins who guzzles it down
greedily
One man, BECKETT, sits shirtless while another, AWKWARD
DAVIES, brow furrowed with concentration, tattoos the first
link of what will be a great chain round BECKETT's waist.
JOE PLAICE, at 45 one of the oldest men on board, stops in
the middle of a story as PULLINGS passes, everyone knuckling
their foreheads in deference to the officer.
10.    BETWEEN TWO GUNS - NIGHT
Boys no more than eight or nine years old play a game of
'jacks' with some sheep bones. ADDISON, RYE and SWIFT are the
powder-monkeys who ferry powder from the hold to the guns
during action.
11.    BERTH DECK - NIGHT
A hundred hammocks swing like strange pods, close packed
under the immense beams. Most of the occupants are already
asleep: here an arm, there a lolling head"|stage direction
15|HOLLAR|Lights out!|speech
16||"On the bosun's command, the last of the off-duty men climb
into their hammocks.
The last lights are extinguished. Only PULLINGS' lamp
remains, moving up the ladder to...
12.   WEATHER DECK - NIGHT
The uppermost or weather deck consists of two parallel
gangways linking the forecastle (forward) to the quarterdeck
(aft).
The lead is dropped from the bows. As PULLINGS walks aft to
the quarterdeck as each man lets go his coils of the deep sea
line."|stage direction

""Watch there! Watch!""
13.     QUARTERDECK - NIGHT
Pullings has joined the officer of the watch, 2nd Lieutenant
MOWETT, a short tubular man in his early 20s.
JACK climbs up a ladder and we see him properly for the first
time: a heavy-set man in his thirties, thick blonde hair
clubbed at the back
At the binnacle, by the ship's great wheel. The helmsman,
BONDEN - a London cockney with a boxer's face - gives JACK
their current course.
JACK nods, then moves to the gunwale with PULLINGS. Jack
sniffs the air and speaks in a low voice."|stage direction

lets out a great hoot of laughter, shattering the tense,
expectant silence."|stage direction
31|JACK|"In for a ""Surprise"". Now that's wit. ""In
for a Surprise"". 'Pon my word I shall
have to tell the Doctor."|speech

amused by JACK's unique sense of humour than by the feeble
joke itself."|stage direction

skeleton and is suspending lead weights from it"|stage direction

remark its prodigious strength."|speech

friends keen interest in this strange assembly"|stage direction

ship under sail. See here the bowsprit.
Here the mast, and here the backstays
running aft."|speech

a paper for the Royal Society."|speech

specimens, open books and brass measuring instruments"|stage direction

finished, we will have to put in to
Recife for provisions. You may care to

Thankyou."|speech
47||"14.     WIDE ON THE SURPRISE - NIGHT
Time passes. The fog intensifies. White coils of mist drift

moves slowly through the night.

JACK instantly awake, piling out of his bed, still dressed.
23.     BERTH-DECK - DAWN
A drum blazes as the off-duty watch tumble out of their
hammocks and run to their battle stations.
24. COCKPIT, ORLOP DECK
Rows of wicked-looking instruments are hastily thrown on the
operating table by PADEEN, MATURIN's servant - saws,
retractors and knives glistening in the lamp-light.
DR. MATURIN hurries in blinking sleep out of his eyes as he
ties on his black apron - behind him, HIGGINS, the assistant
surgeon.

As LAMB, NAGEL and the other carpenters bash down cabin
partitions, transforming the entire gun-deck into a single
continuous space, from the bows to the Captain's Great Cabin
in the stern.
As the crews swarm about their guns, grotesque shadows are
thrown on the walls and ceiling by the numerous battle-
lanterns arriving to illuminate the scene.
27. WEATHER-DECK
JACK and PULLINGS stride the length of the deck toward the
bow [ ] . They pass crews manning the carronades while
others swing the ship's small boats out and over the side to
be towed behind the ship.

was that? The lens pans back toward the darker area to see a
series of flashes.

He turns and shouts to the crew -"|stage direction

Chain shot and grape, bar and canister shriek through the
air. A blizzard of iron.

The crew hit the deck, the last to drop is BONDEN hanging
grimly to the wheel.

36. QUARTERDECK
The broadside hits the bows and a cloud of splinters and
metal scythes the length of the deck at head height. This is
rapidly followed by billowing smoke from a small fire now
burning on the forecastle.
CALAMY is working at putting the fire out as JACK issues a
stream of orders."|stage direction

The Captain's crockery smashes to the deck. KILLICK, cursing
freely, stows what he can.
44.   IN THE ORLOP
Shards of timber implode, followed by a great spout of water
knocking the massive AWKWARD DAVIES sideways as he runs for
the ladder carrying two cannon-balls.
A second explosion, a second jet of water and DAVIES, finding
his feet, starts yelling for the carpenter."|stage direction

Orlop! We're holed!"|unknown

DAVIES arrives to find a gaping hole opposite where his own
gun once stood. Its crew lie scattered, horribly wounded or
dead.
The dismounted gun and twelve pound shot are rolling around
dangerously. HOLLOM, the sole survivor, is backed against
the bulkhead, cradling an injured arm.
CALAMY emerges from the smoke, meets DAVIES's horror-struck
gaze and takes command."|stage direction

Davies! Get those bodies overboard!

Midshipman BLAKENEY, Calamy's rival in the game of marbles,
turns to see the dismounted gun rolling free. He throws a
hammock net under it, stopping its roll before it crushes
CALAMY against the bulkhead.
CALAMY shoots him a brief look of gratitude and runs aft.

itching to fire."|stage direction

139||"48. WIDE ON THE BATTLE
to see the two ships about to pass abreast, the Surprise
heading south as it were, the enemy ship, north.
The French vessel is clearly the bigger ship, and from both
come the sounds of shouted orders and the thunder of drums.
They will pass broadside to broadside, 500 yards apart.

JACK watching the enemy, judging the moment."|stage direction

between their crews. JACK snatches a powder-monkey, ADDISON,
out of the way of the lethal recoil.

Smoke clears to reveal holes in the enemy's foretopsail, a
bowline hanging loose, but again many of her balls have
failed to penetrate the enemy timbers."|stage direction
143||BONDEN|unknown
144||"By all that's holy what is that ship made
of?"|location
145||"His question coincides with a third full broadside from the
Frenchman. The Surprise's wheel shattered. BONDEN thrown
aside, MR. WATT jerked back to the taffrail, the mizzenmast
hit.
A rope sheers and JOE PLAICE is smacked on the skull by a
swinging boom.
Midshipman BLAKENEY, running up on deck, goes to help PLAICE
and is struck down by a flying splinter - a shocking wound to
his upper right arm.
51. COMPANIONWAY
JACK is half-way up the ladder when he falls, scored across
the forehead by a musket-ball.
Eyesight blurred. Hearing gone. He is dimly aware of small

Howard, a big red-faced man, is in his element, laughing
madly every time he scores a hit.

JACK emerges into bloody chaos: screams of the wounded all
around, the enemy ship moving astern in mist and gun-smoke.

The sky a great canopy of stars, the ship racing onwards
through the warm night.
Crew men and the recovering wounded have come up on deck. Now
they sit around in groups, supping their grog. Someone
produces a jaw-harp, someone else a drum.
A guitar is passed from hand to hand, stopping with BLACK
BILL who sings a ballad in an African dialect.
There's an effortless integration of race and rank, of age
and nationality - bonds forged by battle and hardship.
OLD SPONGE gets up and dances a Greek dance: obviously a
favorite among the crew. Cheering and cat-calls. Lanterns
coming up from below. More dancing, insults in many
languages, and a song."|stage direction

STEPHEN is mesmerized by it. He lets go of the rail, leaning
forward to get a better view.
At the same time across from STEPHEN on the opposite gangway,
HOWARD and two or three marines open fire on the bird. The
bird drops low, flying right by STEPHEN.

STEPHEN, BLAKENEY and PADEEN leave the camp on STEPHEN's
first day of exploration. They are armed with nets, baskets
and a day's supply of food and water.
STEPHEN walks slightly stooped, leaning on a walking stick.
238.        COUNTRYSIDE - DAY
A strange and wonderful landscape lies before them, with its
organically-shaped lava flows and alien-looking flora and
fauna.
Everywhere STEPHEN looks there are creatures unique to the
islands. He is in his element, collecting specimens which
PADEEN carefully stores in the baskets.

241.        LOW SCRUB - DAY
The huge, strangely balletic figure of PADEEN chasing after a
butterfly in evening light.
242.        A HEADLAND - DAY
Wide to see another aspect of the countryside - a hint of
distant sea, a rocky headland rising from the plain.
The group is widely scattered. STEPHEN at the base of the
headland, BLAKENEY half a mile further inland. PADEEN coming
up slowly behind, laden with the fruits of their expedition.
243.        BASE OF THE HEADLAND - DAY
STEPHEN rests a moment. Some stones rattle down from the
hillside. He looks up to see a flash of black feathers near
the crest - the cormorant.
On his shirt a red smudge has appeared. His wound has begun
to bleed again.
Ignoring this, Stephen pushes on after his quarry.
244.   THE ROCKY SLOPE
Near the top, STEPHEN pauses to catch his breath and glances
above him.
Again the bird, moving higher, as if leading him on.
STEPHEN gets down on all fours, crawling cautiously to the
crest just above him.
245.   TOP OF THE HEADLAND
A clearing. There is movement in the bushes.
STEPHEN slowly rises, climbs the few paces to the hilltop and
enters a clearing.
He searches amongst the bushes. Nothing.
He turns and looks back down the hillside to see BLAKENEY and
PADEEN far below, then sits to get his breath back again.
STEPHEN'S P.O.V: on the ground between his feet, a beetle. He
picks it up.
Close, on his hand. It is the same type of beetle BLAKENEY
gave him aboard the Surprise.
Smiling at the coincidence STEPHEN raises the tiny creature
to eye level.
His P.O.V.: the beetle, the creature in sharp focus, behind
it the sea, and on the sea, a black shape.
The focus shifts to the background - a ship at anchor in a
bay.
The beetle flies away as STEPHEN stares out at the ship. It's
the Acheron, and they are weighing anchor.
246.         COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK

items collected during the day - some leaves, rocks and
insects - and places them in ordered piles around his
microscope.

Barking, leaping back one by one, great tongues of flame

With an almighty splitting sound their mainmast falls,
dragging yards and rigging with it, the whole mass falling

CALAMY leads his own children's crusade from the bows and
forecastle: youthful but terrifying, screaming and swinging
their blades.
283.    QUARTERDECK
An agonized BLAKENEY watches from where he stands beside
STEPHEN. JOE PLAICE is close by with some of the older men,
ready to ferry the wounded below.
284.    ON THE ACHERON
As the Surprises pour onto the quarterdeck they face
withering fire from the enemy. A dozen men go down, some of
them fatally wounded. Among them are DOUDLE, BOYLE, ALLEN and
HORNER in quick succession.
The attack momentarily falters, and the Acherons surge back
at them.
JACK rallies his men and they charge again - the marine,
TROLLOPE, and NAGEL are blown backwards by grapeshot.
LAMB, enraged, surges past NAGEL's body, swinging his axe to
devastating effect, with HOLLAR by his side and JEMMY DUCKS
protecting their rear, a pistol in each hand, firing from the
hip.
JACK keeps pushing onwards, the centre of the milling,
swirling, hacking crowd, stabbing and pistolling each other
with barely room to fall.
The Acherons are gradually forced back across their
quarterdeck and down into the waist of the ship.
285.   WAIST OF THE ACHERON
JACK crosses swords with a man in front of him, as an enemy
pikeman drives his blade into his left arm, tearing through
the sleeve. BONDEN fires a pistol by his ear, deafening JACK
and killing the pikeman.
To either side, privateers are trying to reach them,
shouting, swearing in English, French and Spanish.
Bullets and missiles rain down from above, killing friend and
foe alike.
KILLICK is in the thick of it, a pistol in either hand, and
from his lips a high-pitched blood-curdling scream.
AWKWARD DAVIES is foaming at the mouth as he swings a meat-
cleaver right and left.

STEPHEN, PADEEN and JOE PLAICE appear from below. STEPHEN
picks up a pistol and with deadly accuracy shoots a privateer
lunging at CAPTAIN HOWARD. The man drops, a neat hole in his
forehead. A moment's astonishment from HOWARD at the Doctor's
surprising skill.
CALAMY fights his way to BLAKENEY who is down on his knees
stabbing at the legs of the attackers.
290.   WAIST, ACHERON
JACK, BONDEN and DAVIES are driving a wedge toward the stern,
the defenders falling back in disarray.
291.   QUARTERDECK OF THE ACHERON
PULLINGS and MOWETT fight side-by-side.
A swivel-gun mounted on the taff-rail is swung to face them.
The gunner is about to fire when a perfectly-aimed musket
ball hits him, again fired by STEPHEN.
292.   QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE/ACHERON
CALAMY, BLAKENEY and their group force the counter-attack
back onto the deck of the Acheron. The two boys fight as a
team as they move toward the stern.

Some Acherons jump overboard to escape the furious attack.
Others are thrown, grasping at woodwork as they fall.
293.   QUARTERDECK OF THE ACHERON
JEMMY DUCKS turns the swivel on a group of Acherons, the
grapeshot blasting them up against the gunwale.

Oil burns. Men drown, others struggle to stay afloat,
clinging to the mass of wreckage floating by the hull.

Cheering from the Surprises, demands to surrender in many
languages, some beg for mercy, others fight on.
296.   BELOW DECKS
JACK moves alone, down to the berth deck. He smashes the
chain off a locked-door, releasing a dozen or more prisoners.
Everywhere signs of the lethal blast through the ship's
stern, bodies, guns upended, shattered timbers.
He makes his way through to the Great Cabin.

Four privateers look up as JACK bursts in.

their colours.
A cheer from the Surprises - a few last shots fired. CALAMY
and BLAKENEY cheering, BLAKENEY holding aloft the captured
flag.
A dying Frenchman suddenly lunges at CALAMY with a sabre.
BLAKENEY steps in front of him and takes the blow.
