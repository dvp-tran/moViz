Warm on the sand?
Betcha on land
They understand

Bright young women
Sick o' swimmin'
Ready to stand
And ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions
And get some answers
What's a fire and why does it

True gentlemen avoid it when they can
But they dote and swoon and fawn
On a lady who's withdrawn

Go ahead!
Make your choice!
I'm a very busy woman
And I haven't got all day
