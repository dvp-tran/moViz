Blackness.  We hear:"|stage direction
1|VOICE|Ready?|speech
2|SECOND VOICE (LENNY)|Yeah.  Boot it.|speech
3||"A burst of bright white static exploding across the
darkness.  A high whine on the audio track gives way to
street sounds and rapid breathing.
AN IMAGE wavers and stabilizes: A nervous POV.  We're in a
car, sitting in the backseat, and we're nervous, the view
swinging around, showing the street rolling by outside the
windows, then whipping back to the two guys in the front
seat.
Our POV looks down at a SMALL RECORDING DEVICE in ""our""
hands.  A red LED is flashing.  We slip the recorder into
a coat pocket."|stage direction
4|OUR VOICE|Okay.  It's goin'.  I'm recording.|speech
5||"The guy riding shotgun, LANE, is just pulling a pantyhose
over his head, smearing his features into a pig-like mask.
He turns, DIRECTLY TO THE LENS, pissed off."|stage direction
6|LANE|"Good one, dickhead.  Thanks for
waitin' till I get this fuckin thing
on.  You tryin' ta I.D. me, or
what?"|speech
7||"He tosses another pantyhose right at us and we catch it.
Our POV looks down, into the pantyhose, which comes up
over our field of view.
We realize: this is not some ride-along verite video.
WE ARE ONE OF THESE GUYS.  Real honest-to-God point of
view, with no cuts, no music.  This is not film, it is
human experience.
The driver is a Hispanic guy named ""SPAZ"" DIAZ.  Lane is a
white guy who looks very strung out.  Couple of
crackheads.  The car is a mid-seventies barge, piebald
with primer."|stage direction
8|LANE|Next alley... just pull in slow.|speech
9||(turning to us)|location
10|LANE|Hurry up will ya.  Here.|speech
11||"He hands us a big stainless steel revolver.  The POV looks
down as our shaky hands snap open the cylinder, check the
rounds, snap it closed.
Diaz pulls the barge into an alley.  The headlights
illuminate overflowing dumpsters.  A Chicano busboy is
making trash runs out the back door of a restaurant, which
he has chocked open.  The busboy goes back inside."|stage direction
12|LANE|Let's go.|speech
13||"Out of the car, quickly, our own breathing loud in our
ears.  We even hear our own heartbeat, racing now.
Through the door, after Lane, moving fast.
Into the kitchen.  Fluorescent glare.  The busboy turning,
surprised, Lane putting the shotgun in his face.  Freezing
him.  Lane puts a finger to his lips: ""quiet"" in any
language.
Our hand puts the magnum in the THAI COOK's face.  We get
them down on the greasy floor, Lane controlling them with
the shotgun.  He looks at us, snaps his eyes toward the
front room.
We hear voices as we approach the swing door.  Go through.
Whip pan left, then right.  Scoping the layout.  Low-rent
THAI place.  Red wallpaper.  Closing time.  Middle-aged
Thai OWNER, by the cash-register, counting money.  Young
Thai WAITRESS, cleaning up.  They look up, stunned, as we
put the gun on them."|stage direction
14||(shouting, edgy)|location
15|OUR VOICE|"Don't move, don't talk, don't do
nothing."|speech
16||"Our POV is whipping around, from the front door to the
owner to the kitchen where Lane is standing in the doorway
covering the cook and busboy, back to the owner as he
steps back from the cash-register.
We scoop up the big wad of bills: seven, eight hundred
bucks in tens and fives.
Now yelling, herding the owner and the waitress into the
kitchen, the owner trying to calm the girl in singsongy
Thai, Lane shouting at him to shut up.
Into the walk-in cooler.  The steel door closes on four
scared pair of eyes.  POV looking around, seeing... a
dish-rack.  Our hand pulls out a spoon, drops the spoon
handle through the hole in the cooler door-latch.  Locking
them in.
Lane heading out the back door.  Laughing, as he looks at
the wad of cash our hand is waving in front of him.
We follow Lane to the car.  Snap a look down the alley one
way, then the other.
Shit!  Cop Black-and-White pulling into the far end of the
alley.  Heartbeat goes triple time.  Scrambling into the
car.
Door not even closed and SPAZ has it in reverse, burning
rubber as he launches back down the alley.
SCRUNCH!  The car grinds along one wall as SPAZ steers
wildly backward.  Sparks right next to us.  Then--
KBOOM!  As we slam into a dumpster and push it right out
into the street.
The cop has his lights and siren on, and is roaring at us
as SPAZ cranks the wheel and punches it down the street.
He curses in English and Spanish as he weaves between
cars.  We pull off the stocking to see better.
The cop car surges onto the street behind us.
Looking ahead.  A red light.  Cars stopped, blocking the
way.  Cutting to the right, onto the sidewalk, around the
cars, into the intersection.
A near miss with cross traffic, then accelerating.
Another red light ahead."|stage direction
17|LANE|Don't stop!|speech
18||"Truck entering the intersection.  Everyone yelling.  SPAZ
cuts the wheel but too late...
Clipping the truck and spinning.
The street outside smearing past like the view from a
Tilt-a-whirl.
Then KBLAM!  Hitting something, God-knows-what, and
launching up and over, and--
KRUNCH!  Crushing metal and an explosion of broken glass.
It gets quiet and still.  Tinkling glass as Lane moves.
Then SPAZ is screaming.  The car is upside down.
Crawling out of the side window.  A frenzy now.
Whip pan to see the cops pulling up.
Then whipping back to the wreck.  The engine is burning.
Flames spreading rapidly.  SPAZ inside, pinned, upside
down, blood pumping across his face.
Our hands pulling Lane out.  He comes up running.
We run after him, sprinting toward the welcoming darkness
of an alley.
Panting breath and heartbeats and sirens and somebody
yelling.
Gunshots.  Looking back.  Cops next to their car, firing.
Ahead, Lane running into shadow.
Then a door opening, a man coming out of a metal firedoor.
Lane grabbing him, throwing him out of the way, holding
the door open as we dive through into--
A stairwell.  Lane sprinting up, two steps at a time.
Trying the door at the second floor landing.  Locked.
Shit.
Running up.  Dizzying whirl as we run, up and up.
The POV is finally broken by a..."|stage direction

20||INT.  UNDERGROUND GARAGE|location
21||"But we don't know where we are yet.  We see a man in
extreme close-up: just his eyes and mouth.  The eyes are
closed, the eyeballs tracking under the lids, like he is
watching a movie in there.  This is LENNY."|stage direction
22|LENNY|"This is great... the doors are all
locked.  Who are these losers,
friends of yours?"|speech
23||CUT TO:|unknown
24||"BACK TO POV as we reach the fifth floor landing.  Lane is
coming unglued as he finds this door locked.  We look
down, see cops coming two floors below.  One cranks off a
couple rounds at us and we snap back from the railing.
Pounding up the last flight.  Finally!  The door is
unlocked.
Blasting through it, behind Lane, onto the roof.  Running
all out past AC units and pipes, air vents.  Looking up:
an LAPD helicopter orbiting close.  It flicks the xenon
onto us and we are running in a vibrating circle of blue
daylight.
Running along the edge of the roof.  Looking down.  Car
burning upside down in the street below.  The gas tank
explodes, filling the street with orange light.  We don't
slow.  We're running all out."|stage direction
25|LENNY (V.O.)|"Wow... the gas tank is a nice touch.
Oh, oh, end of the line boys."|speech
26||"Ahead, in POV we see the edge of the roof coming up.
Beyond it is another building, about ten feet lower and
separated by a 20 foot alley.
But Lane doesn't slow down.  He leaps across the void and
makes it to the other building, landing in a sprawl.
We reach the edge and look down.  Six stories.  No ladders
or fire-escapes.  Whip to behind us.  Cops running across
the roof."|stage direction
27|LANE|Come on!  Fucking jump man!|speech
28||"The POV backs up from the edge and then runs toward it...
Out into the void.  Moving... airborne... then...
WHAM!  Right into the parapet wall.
Slipping down.  Brick wall right in our face.  Bloody
fingers grabbing for a rusty piece of pipe running along
the edge.
Looking down... feet dangling over a sixty foot drop.
A cat walking through a patch of light in the alley below,
oblivious.
Breathing raspy.  Snapping a look up as the pipe gives
way.
A keening whine coming from us as we scramble to climb up
but...
Snapping a look down--
Walls rushing past, sound of wind, and our own raspy
scream--
Ground rushing up--
Split second impression of a cat, looking up, yowling and
running out of the way as--
Pavement fills frame.  A burst of violent red light.
Sound like a gunshot... but no echo.
Only silence.  And blackness."|stage direction

30||INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE|location
31||"Lit by miles of fluorescent.  Empty and echoing.  Close on
Lenny.  He has something on his head.  Something that
looks like a mutated set of Walkman headphones, except
they have little gecko fingers that fit along the temples
and over the forehead.  PLAYBACK ""TRODES"".  Lenny whips
off the trodes, gasping as if he got gutpunched."|stage direction
32|LENNY|"Goddamnit!  You know I don't deal in
snuff.  How many times I hafta tell
you?!"|speech
33||"Lenny is with a guy everybody knows as ""TICK"", a pale-
skinned creature of the night in T-shirt and leather
jacket.  Tick is a bottomfeeder in the techno-underground
of the near future."|stage direction
34|TICK|Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.|speech
35|LENNY|"Well you could've at least warned
me.  You know I hate the zap... when
they die.  It just brings down your
whole day.  Jeez, Tick."|speech
36|TICK|Sorry.|speech
37||"LENNY NERO is low thirties.  Handsome.  Charming.  And you
better check to see if you still have your ring after you
shake with him.  He is wearing an expensive Italian
jacket, and what he thinks of as a ""power tie."" His Rolex
isn't real.  His greasy hair is too long and curls around
his collar.  He needs to shave.  A little sleazy.  But he
has energy, and heavy street smarts.
Lenny is sitting on the hood of his '97 BMW 1035i.  Tick
is facing him, sitting in the back of his beat-to-shit
70's van.  There are a lot of tapes and tech stuff piled
inside the van.  Lenny has a Haliburton case open next to
him, like a drug dealer.  In fact the whole setup looks
like a drug deal, but it's not.  Though it is illegal.
The case holds Lenny's personal playback deck, his trodes,
and a rack of the little tapes in which he deals.  They
are about the size of DAT tapes, and hold about 30 minutes
of sensory experience... everything a person sees, hears,
and feels... recorded directly from the cerebral cortex at
the moment it is happening."|stage direction
38|LENNY|"How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't
the cops put it in evidence?"|speech
39|TICK|"With all the blood I guess they
didn't see the rig.  Guy had it
under a wig."|speech
40|LENNY|Yeah, but how'd it get to you?|speech
41|TICK|I got ways, Lenny, I got ways.|speech
42||(off Lenny's impatient|location
43||look)|unknown
44|TICK|"Okay, okay... I got a deal with some
a the paramedics.  My guy pages me
and I pick it up at the morgue.  So
whaddya think?  This clip's gotta be
worth at least a grand.  Right?"|speech
45|LENNY|"Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I
don't deal this kind of product, you
know that.  I'll give you four for
it, cause I've gotta cut off the
last bit.  And my customers want
uncut."|speech
46|TICK|"Fuck that!  The last part's the
best.  You dry-dive six stories and
blammo!  Jack right into the Big
Black."|speech
47|LENNY|"I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's
policy.  I got ethics here."|speech
48|TICK|"Yeah, when did that start?  Come on,
man!  It's what people want to see,
and you know it."|speech
49|LENNY|So lay it off to somebody else.|speech
50|TICK|"Come on, Lenny.  I got expenses.  I
got to get this rig fixed.  Look at
it..."|speech
51||"Tick holds up a zip-lock bag containing the Walkman-sized
stainless steel CORTICAL RESONANCE RECORDER, the record
deck we saw earlier in the POV.  Also in the bag is the
SQUID NET, a matrix of sensors designed to conform to the
human head (this is different from playback trodes).  The
whole works are covered with congealed blood."|stage direction
52|TICK|"Give me six at least.  This's a good
clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'."|speech
53|LENNY|"Yeah, well, the first part's okay.
Better than the usual soaps you
bring me."|speech
54|TICK|"Now that is cold, Lenny.  I always
bring you choice."|speech
55||"Lenny fishes around in a cardboard box at Tick's feet,
pulling out a tape."|stage direction
56|LENNY|"Sure, like this low-grade shit here,
some girl in a fight with her
boyfriend... it's a test-pattern.
Nothing happens.  I'm snorin'."|speech
57|TICK|"Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me
real life.  Bring me street life.
And, like, one man's mundane and
desperate existence is another man's
Technicolor.'"|speech
58|LENNY|"I said that?  Look, I'll take it for
five, and you'll make out okay,
because in this case it's pure
cream, you don't have to cut
anything back to the wearer."|speech

Lenny in his BMW, driving through the LA streets.
Streetlights and neon flare across the windshield in a
calligraphy of light.  Lenny works the cellular, gets
messages on his DIGITAL PAGER, weaves in and out of

stations all the time.  Raw, nervous energy: like a kid
who can't stay still.  It's a hard hustle in the big food
chain."|stage direction

blasts.  Something fast... a rap-metal hybrid.  Anger and
energy.
WE CUT IN fast blitzes of images like a burst of automatic
weapons fire: helicopters on patrol, people running in the
streets, buildings smoldering, fists raised, shouting
people, paramedics rushing a body into an ambulance,
Korean store owners armed to the teeth, a body covered by
a yellow plastic sheet, blood running down the gutter.
Cops in riot gear, with M-16s, on patrol in a Hispanic
neighborhood.
BACK TO LENNY coming out of a bar with a nervous
businessman.  We don't hear the conversation.  MUSIC OVER.
Lenny palms a roll of bills from the guy as he slips a
squid tape into the pocket of the businessman's suit
jacket.  Lenny claps him on the shoulder and walks away.
Lenny's beeper goes off and he pauses to look at the
number.
ON LENNY DRIVING.
Ahead, through the windshield we see a police checkpoint.
The cops have thrown a block across the street and are
shinning their lights in the cars as they creep through.
Lenny slaps his ID against the side window with one hand,

harsh breathing, rustling sheets.
BACK TO LENNY in the booth with Skinner.  Lenny has
Skinner's tape running in a playback deck clipped to his

145||"A woman's feet moving along the steel rail of a train
track at night.  The woman has no shoes, her feet bare.
IRIS stumbles along the track, clutching one shoe
pointlessly to her chest.  She is swearing and crying,
runny mascara leaving two tragic streaks down her pale
face.  Despite this we see that she is attractive, though
her dress and make-up seem designed to convey overt
sexiness.  Her white skin is complemented by a wild mane
of curly red hair.
She is in her early twenties, and the harshness of her
life has just begun to harden her features.  She looks
lost and without hope, in fear of her life.  Her breath
comes in hitching sobs, and her eyes are wild.
She runs between cold steel walls of freight cars, looking
behind her frequently.  A police helicopter is circling.
Its xenon beam plays over the train yard, sweeping over
the cars.  She hunches into the shadows of a freight-car
as the beam passes over.  Looking under the cars she sees
an LAPD patrol car cruising down a street adjoining the
yard, its searchlight sweeping toward her.  It moves on.
She continues her run, moving away from the direction of
the patrol car.  She reaches a chain-link fence.  Crying,
she scrambles over it, cutting her hands and ripping her
dress.  Another patrol car passes two blocks away.  She
crouches in the tall grass until it rounds a corner out of
sight."|stage direction

scatter into the shadows ahead of her.  She doesn't seem
to notice.  All she cares about are the police lights, and
the sound of the helicopter droning, circling.
She pauses at the mouth of the alley, scanning the well-
lit street beyond.  There are people here: downtown low-
life street people.  A half-block away is a brightly lit
sign marking the entrance to a Red-Line subway station.
She walks along the sidewalk, her eyes on the sign,
feeling exposed as she walks openly, her heart pounding.
She is a mess, but in this section of town people barely
glance at her.
LOW ANGLE on her bare feet, standing out amid the shoes
and boots of winter.
SHE CROSSES the street, and reaches the sidewalk just as a
black-and-white rounds the corner at the end of the block,
behind her.
IN THE CRUISER are TWO COPS, who are scanning the street.
They look intense.  Revved up.  They are BURDEN SPREG, a
massive, barrel-chested street-lifer in his mid-forties,
and DWAYNE ENGELMAN, an aggressive hard-on in his twenties
with a brush cut, a Nautilus body, and a face like a
ferret."|stage direction

after her.
Iris sprints along in her bare feet, all-out like a track
runner.  The black-and-white screeches to the curb next to
her and the cops jump out.
Iris hits the stairs down to the subway station at a full-

his 9mm.  In his eyes we see an unaccountable craziness...
a hunter who has as much at stake somehow as the prey.
Street people fall back as Spreg thunders through them.
They aren't about to get in the way of this juggernaut cop
and his boy wonder.
The two cops reach the platform.  No Iris in sight.

thundering along the platform to intercept her.  Engelman
straight-arms his pistol."|stage direction

momentum carries her clear across the car, where she slams
into the far wall and staggers back, almost falling.  She
gasps for breath and looks up to see...
... Spreg crashing against the outside of the doors she
just came through as the train starts to move.  He tries
to force the doors apart... can't.  He aims his gun
through the window.
Thinking fast Iris dives to his side of the car and
presses herself up against the solid wall next to the
door, where he can't see her.
OUTSIDE, Spreg is running next to the accelerating train.
He swings his pistol, smashing the window with the butt.
Iris screams as Spreg lunges through the opening next to
her like some uniformed nightmare and grabs her.  He is
still running alongside, pulling on her.  Trying to drag
her right out through the window.
She struggles.  Bites his beefy hand.  He swears and lets
go.  Then makes one last grab.  Gets his fingers into her
long mane of hair.  Yanks on her.  She comes half out the
window, screaming.
Then... RIP!  The hair pulls off her head.
Spreg drops away, behind the speeding train, holding a
red wig.  He looks at it stupidly, then raises his pistol
and fires at Iris.
She jerks back through the window and drops to the floor.
A couple of shots hit the metal outside.  We see Iris has
short hair, platinum white.  In it are a few of the many
pins which held the wig securely in place.  She gasps for
air, sobbing and hugging her knees, trembling all over.
SPREG STANDS on the platform, watching the train
disappear, as Engelman runs up.  Spreg looks at the wig in
his hand, disgusted.  He turns it and looks inside, at the
cap.
CLOSE ON THE CAP inside the wig: there is an intricate
network of sensors in a grid over the entire underside of
the wig.  The sensors are connected by wires, in a pattern
like the veins of a leaf, bundling to a small, flat metal
box, the size of a cigarette case.  It is a SQUID NET.
Iris was wired.  Spreg just stares at the SQUID NET, eyes
going crazy wide."|stage direction

the twenty others on his machine.  He just deadbolts the
door and locks a steel bar across the door frame, then
carries his Haliburton...
... toward the bedroom.  And we see the truth of his
reality.  Lenny's crib is a shit-box.  It is a small one-
bedroom, barely furnished.  A couple of chairs.  Swap-meet
couch.  Cardboard boxes full of tech gear stacked in the
corners, unidentified electronics components piled on a
table, cables strung everywhere.  God knows what this
stuff is.  There is aluminum foil taped to all the
windows.  Fast food cartons, empty Coke cans, pizza boxes
everywhere.  The bachelor apartment from hell.  High-tech
low-life.
He goes into the bedroom.  Mattress on the floor.  Same
infernal interior decoration, but this room is dominated
by racks of tapes... Squid tapes.
Lenny pours himself a vodka from a bedside bottle, takes
off his clothes and hangs them over a chair.  He sits on
the bed in his underwear, looking lonely and depressed.
This is the private Lenny: No plans.  No dreams.  Nothing
to look forward to but another day of the hustle.
He puts a set of playback trodes carefully on his head,
fishes around in a shoe box among a bunch of tapes,
squinting at the hand-written labels: they all say
""FAITH."" Only the dates are different.
He selects one and inserts it in the deck, makes some
minute adjustments.  Sips his vodka.  Leans back.  Closes
his eyes.  And hits PLAY.
PLAY BACK SEQUENCE/ POV:
We are moving along the Venice boardwalk, following a
YOUNG WOMAN on Rollerblades.  By our motion, it is obvious
that we are on Rollerblades too, and not doing so well.
The woman is laughing, turning circles around us, cracking
up at our discomfort.
We hear Lenny's voice complaining a mile a minute, and we
realize the POV is his.  The girl takes our hands, skating
backward, towing us along the boardwalk.  It is a sunny
afternoon, and it is the usual boardwalk freak show all
around us.
The woman is FAITH JUSTIN, a singer.  Lenny is desperately
in love with her.  It's not hard to see why.  She is
beautiful, in an alive, dynamic way.  Her hair is a wild
dark mane, and her eyes are spectacular... intense.  She
moves with a lithe, sinuous grace.  We are staring at her
eyes instead of concentrating on skating.
Whammo!  The POV spins and we are sitting, looking up at
Faith as she circles, laughing.  She skates over to help
us up.
CUT TO LENNY, on his bed, smiling.  He punches Fast
Forward.
BACK TO POV.  A kinetic blur of digital hash, then...
We are following Faith, now holding her skates, up the
steps to a beach apartment.  Inside it is funky and
comfortable.
Music from a disk player she left on.  Bob Marley singing
""Three Little Birds"".  Faith, covered with a sheen of
sweat, sways to the music as she goes into a bedroom.  We
follow her.
She comes out of the small bathroom with a towel, starts
to dry off.  Sunlight comes in the window lighting up
Faith like she is in a spotlight.  We move up behind her
and take the towel away, and now we see Lenny standing
behind Faith in the mirror over the dresser.
He puts his arms around her and they sway together to the
music.  He runs his fingers in lazy circles over her
sweaty belly.  Then leans down and licks the sweat off her
shoulder, all the while watching her in the mirror.  A
voyeur recording his voyeurism through his own eyes, so he
can replay and relive the moment.
Their eyes meet in the mirror.
They both watch as Lenny slides his hand up under her
halter and caresses her nipples.  She moans softly,
responding.  She turns to him, and our POV shifts directly
to her.  She is right in front of us, in TIGHT CLOSE UP.

blocking the view for a moment.

at her, looking down across our body, Lenny's body, as

our belt and we--

547||"Mace accompanies Lenny into the pounding din of the
Retinal Fetish.  The place is a fringe hangout, a
converted schmata factory transformed into a warren of
dark rooms and corridors off the main dance floor.  A
thundering labyrinth.  Steel cage-like partitions of
chain-link give the place a harsh, concentration-camp
atmosphere.  The music is a bass tech-thump, and the
clientele are young and on the rough side.  Cybergrunge.
There are many large video screens running a continuous
montage of wild graphics and images... a flurry of
disturbing videos: MTV baptized by William Burroughs.
The Fetish is a street-tech hangout, a meeting place for a
lot of digital-underground types that Lenny knows.  You
can buy and sell what you want here: illicit hardware and
software, as well as chemicals for the wetware (brain).
Lenny and Mace are greeted inside by two suited guys with
metal detectors.  They barely notice as they are scanned:
it's routine there days.  Mace shows her gun, a Sig Saur
9mm, and her state carry-permit.  The security guys check
her pistol like a coat, giving her a claim check.
Through the crowd in the lounge Lenny's eyes go
immediately to one table.  It seems to be in a pool of
light all it's own; or maybe this is just in Lenny's mind.
SLOW MOTION: Lenny watches a man at the table holding
court, with a beautiful young woman sitting next to him.
It is TRAN VO.  He's a mover and shaker in the record
business: he produces, he manages, he tries to keep
everyone in his orbit.
The woman is FAITH JUSTIN.  We recognize her from playback
as Lenny's ex-girlfriend.  But now her hair has been dyed
jet black and frames her face in a wild tangle.  She is
wearing as expensive custom leather jacket over a sheer
silk top.  She has on too much make-up, which gives her
features a feral-doll quality.  Faith looks like what she
is, a rock star wannabe.  But the look is red-hot.
Tran looks around the room.  His eyes miss nothing.  And
show nothing.  His hand -- unhurried, graceful, remarkable
-- brushes past Faith's cheek, barely touching her.  His
fingers pick up a strand of hair, tuck it like a treasure
behind her ear... fingers touching her head now... a
moment of suspended time.
... and she trembles.  Just a little.  For a second.
Tran and Faith are flanked on either side by an entourage
consisting of music types, various hangers on, and Tran's
personal security force of four: JOEY CORTO, a whippet-
thin skinhead; DUNCAN, a none-too-bright armbreaker in the
classic mold; a massively built ex-jock type called WADE
BEEMER; and a sixteen year old Asian stone fox, CINDY
MINH, aka 'VITA', possibly the most lethal of the four."|stage direction

stay casual.

The HOUSE LIGHTS dim and the STAGE LIGHTS come up.  And
Faith is standing there.  Like she beamed in.  She is
wearing a revealing leather outfit, showing a lot of her
milk-white skin.  Her black hair frames her eyes, giving
her an intense feral look.  Faith starts to sing.
Beautiful, unearthly, clear notes.
SUDDENLY the band kicks down with a wall of thundering
sound.  Faith explodes into motion.  Her body convulses
like a 440 volt mainline is hooked up to her.  Her voice
becomes a scream, an inchoate wail, a police siren.  The
pain and rage of an entire, hell-bent tormented planet on
its eve of judgment.
Lost in the song, Faith has found herself.  She wheels
across the stage, slashing her head up and down so that
her hair bursts in the strobe-flashes like flak.
A techno-erotic pagan.  A force of nature.
Lenny is mesmerized.  He has seen this before, many times.
But it always has the same effect on him.  He is
transported into another world by her, a world in which
there is only the two of them.
TIGHT ON MACE, eyes on the stage... a big piece of the
puzzle suddenly fits.  She's never seen Faith perform
before.  Holy shit.
Faith doesn't play to the audience, or engage them in any
way.  She is merely taking what's in her head and letting
it out.  She doesn't care if they are there or not.  Now
shrieking into the silence after a climatic downbeat, and
holding the note... holding it longer than you believe she
possibly could.  Then nothing.

black and white.  Yet the detail is crisp and clear,

WE ARE WALKING down a windowless hallway at a large hotel.
An apparently endless row of doors.  The Wearer's glance

holding... a black ski-mask.  He pulls it on, leaving the
subsequent POV seen through the eye-holes of the mask.

avoided his reflection up until now.  We see a man,
dressed in a jogging suit and black fanny-pack, and of

and goes outside, moving to the wall dividing this room's
balcony from the one next door.
The Wearer climbs the railing and, six stories above the
pavement, slips around the wall, stepping down onto the
other balcony.  We hug the wall, looking furtively into
the room.  It is a suite.  In the living room we see a
woman making herself a drink at the mini-bar.  She
turns...
It is Iris.  She is wearing a T-shirt and panties.
Probably ready for bed.  She looks like she can't sleep.
Pours the Scotch shakily.
CUT TO LENNY, the streetlight washing across his face.  He
gets suddenly serious with a flash of premonitory dread.
IN POV we see Iris go into the bedroom, out of sight.  We
can hear the television on in there.  Using a steel jimmy
the Wearer slips the latch on the balcony slider and
silently opens it, slipping inside.
We stalk quietly to the bedroom door, listening to her
movements.  Water running in the bathroom.  We come around
the door frame.  Bedroom dark, bathed in TV glow.  Iris in
the bathroom, washing her face with cold water.
We move toward her.  Crossing the room as she reaches for
a towel.  We are now only a couple of feet away.  She
comes out of the bathroom, walking right past us, drying
her face.  She lowers the towel, turning away... her eyes
whip back.  Widening in terror.
She reacts with surprising speed, diving across the bed.
We go after her.
Her hand goes under the pillow and comes out with a small
automatic.  She whips it around toward us but we grab it
and twist it away before she can fire.  She smashes the
palm of her hand into our face and rolls off the bed,
lightning-fast.
We follow her as she scrambles up, running through the
bedroom door.  Across the living room and down the short
hall to the front door.  Closing rapidly on her as she
somehow gets the chain off the door and gets out into the
hall.
Slam!  We tackle her against the far wall of the corridor.
Our right hand comes into view holding a small electric
stunner.  ZAP!  We nail her right in the back between the
shoulder blades.
She sags to the floor, gasping.  We zap her again.  The
Wearer's glance does a 180 both ways down the corridor...
nobody in sight.  We clamp our hand over Iris' mouth and
drag her back into her room, locking the door.

finger come up in front of us and hear SSSHHH.
Moving quickly now.  Our hands unbuckle the fanny pack.
Pull out something... a set of playback trodes.  Our hands
place them on her head.  She stares uncomprehending.
What?  We catch a glimpse of some electronics stuff inside
the pack... a record deck, some wires, a small metal box."|stage direction

his own output.  She's seeing what
he's seeing.  She's seeing herself."|speech
719||"Iris can now see herself as the Wearer sees her... wide-
eyed with terror, white-lipped, weeping.  Helpless.  And
she can feel what he feels.
The Wearer's hand goes back into the fanny-pack and pulls
out something else.  A black athletic headband.  We slip
it over her head, down over her eyes.  A blindfold.  Now
she can only see what the wearer sees.
And also from the bag we pull... a yellow plastic object.
With our thumb we extend the five inch blade of the razor
knife, the type with tips that can be broken off by
segments when they get dull.  It extends with an ominous
clicking sound.
We lower it toward her and cut up the middle of her T-
shirt, laying it open.  Exposing her torso.  We then look
down and slide the knife under the side band of her
panties, slicing them off.  We put the knife up to her
throat, and she whimpers, afraid to cry out, and then we
draw the flat side of the blade across her body as if to
tease her with the prospect of her death.
MACE LOOKS AT LENNY'S EXPRESSION of dawning horror and
pulls the car to the curb about a half-block from the
Sunset Sheraton.  Lenny is hyperventilating, shifting in
his seat as if ants are crawling over him.  He is
experiencing the stalker's exhilaration.
IN POV we see the Wearer pull his jogging pants down below
his knees (R-rated please) and reach for Iris.  Kneeling
in front of her, he pushes her legs apart and pulls her
hips forward onto him, pushing into her.
Iris is feeling and seeing what he sees and feels... She
feels her own pain and humiliation swirling with the
killer's exhilaration.
ON LENNY, sweating and barely able to breath.  Mace stops
the tape... concerned by Lenny's reaction.  He opens his
eyes... Mace see the fear there, of what the tape may
reveal.  But he shakes his head.  He has to know.  He
pushes her hand away and punches PLAY.
IT FLOODS INTO HIS HEAD AGAIN.  The sweaty, grunting
horror.  The stalker picks up her slit T-shirt and quickly
wraps it around her neck.  He knots it tight and twists
one powerful hand into the knot.  The muscles in his
forearm look like cables as he turns the knot tighter.
The stalker viciously twists the knot a full turn and the
T-shirt fabric almost disappears into the skin under her
jaw.
Via her trodes, Iris watches herself die.  Her death comes
at the moment of his orgasm which is fed to her...
blasting off the planet on total overload... terror, pain,
death merging with ecstasy and exultation at the same
instant.
ON LENNY, crying out and grabbing for the trodes, but he
just holds onto them, as if they are sucking his brains
out of his skull."|stage direction

gasps for breath.

side to side... studying her dead face.  Her staring eyes.
He leans very close to her and stares into one dead eye,
the pupil wide, seeing nothing.

Lenny opens his eyes.  He fumbles open the car door and
practically rolls out onto the sidewalk.  The trodes pull
off his head as he lurches up, reeling across the sidewalk
to a darkened storefront where he leans for support.  He
doubles over and heaves up the contents of his stomach.

building.  We recognize it by the unkempt pool, the sunken
deck furniture.  We walk through a breezeway to an ally-
like courtyard behind the building.  We approach a door...
the back door to Lenny's apartment.
The killer picks the lock on the back door.  Opens the
door and enters.  The apartment is dark, blacked out.  We
are in the kitchen.  We stop and listen.  Water dripping
in the sink.  Soft snoring from the living room.
Moving to the other room.  Slowly, silently.  Furtively
looking around the door frame to the living room.  There
is Lenny, crashed out on the couch.
Now moving stealthily toward him.  Kneeling down beside
him.  Lenny, burned out from the night before, is deep
under.  Our hand comes into view, holding the yellow
plastic razor knife.  With his thumb, the killer extends
the blade... click, click, click, click.
The blade flashes in a beam of sunlight as it moves toward
Lenny.  The killer lays it gently against Lenny's throat.
Draws it slowly across... not leaving a mark.
The POV backs away and -- static as the tape ends.
LENNY, IN THE PRESENT, whips off the trodes, freaking.  He
feels around his throat with one hand... can't feel
anything.
Crossing quickly to a mirror near the front door, he
inspects his neck minutely.  There is a hair-line red line
over his carotid.  He looks around the room wildly, his
heart hammering.  Slowly, he gets his breathing under
control.
Then... he hears something in the kitchen.  A tiny click.
His eyes go wide.  Hyperventilating, Lenny moves silently
into the bedroom.  He fishes around under the bed and
pulls out a GLOCK 22 .45 auto pistol.  He stalks silently
toward the kitchen.
Then he looks at the butt of the pistol-grip: no magazine.
He un-stalks back to the bed and finds a loaded magazine
under a bunch of dirty socks.  He inserts it quietly,
wincing as he chambers a round.
Heart thudding, he works his way to the kitchen door.  He
edges around the frame, pie-ing the room.  Cop reflexes
intact.

IT IS THE MOTHER OF ALL PARTIES.  IN AN AERIAL SHOT we see
there must be 100,000 people jamming the closed streets of
downtown L.A.  Arc lights sweep the sky.  There are two
outdoor bandstands, with live music pounding.  There are
lasers, strobe-lights.  People are literally dancing in
the streets... if they can move at all.  Huge projection
video screens are set up all over the place.
LA is connected to other cities all over the world by
satellite, sharing in the celebration in different time
zones.  The excitement has been building all evening as
midnight sweeps across the country toward the West Coast.
It looks like a U2 concert 10 blocks long: a multimedia
blow-out.
Madness in the streets.  And Lenny and Mace are stuck in
it.  The Civic can't move in the middle of this millennial
Mardi Gras.  People swarm around, pounding on the Civic as
they go by, or press their faces against the glass.  It
may be the party of the century, but it looks like the
middle of a third world revolution."|stage direction

protesting horns behind her.  And we see that she's
wearing a short black cocktail dress.  Lenny comes around
the car, through the wild crowd.  He's in his other suit.
Snappy.
Mace unselfconsciously hikes up her dress and slips her
.380 auto into a holster velcroed to her leg.  She pulls
the dress down and you can't see the gun, hidden between
her upper thighs.
In fact, it looks like she couldn't be concealing a
quarter anywhere on her body.  The dress is cut low at the
top and high at the bottom, showing plenty of muscular
legs.  High heels doing great things for her calves.  Her
braids now loose and full, like a mane.

warning.  Like the hiss of a snake.  Our hands seize her
wrists and handcuff them one by one to the iron frame at
the head of the bed.

deftly cuts off her panties.

LENNY tears the trodes from his head.  He clutches his
stomach, gasping for breath.  Carrying the playback deck,
he staggers into the bedroom... to the bed.  He stares
wildly around the room.
One whole wall of the bedroom is mirrored.  In the mirror
he spots a shape, on the floor beyond the bed.  It is
covered in the bed sheet, but it is clearly a human form,
propped up against the wall on the far side of the night
stand.  He missed it in his earlier look from the bedroom
door.
Lenny moves around the bed and reaches down to the foot of
the figure, grasping the edge of the sheet with a
trembling hand.  With horrified apprehension he pulls on
the sheet.
It reveals the head and upper body of... Tran Vo.
The last thing he expected.  Lenny leans close and sees
that Tran is breathing shallowly, but his eyes are vacant.
He looks like Tick did.
Lenny sits on the bed and puts the trodes back on.  The
fireworks and screaming outside sound like some
nightmarish war, like the sound of the world coming to an

hits PLAY.
THE POV CONTINUES where it left off.  Faith's body lurches
with the Wearer's thrusts.  His hand tightens the belt.
Lenny feels the climax building.
Faith's body shakes as the killer comes... she cries out
herself, in pain... or is it?  The killers hand releases
the belt.  We see Faith gasping for breath and moaning.

doors along one wall.  In the mirror is a reflection of

Pants down, her legs pulled up around him.  They are both

orgasms.  He runs his hands over her sweat-slick belly.
LENNY is stunned beyond his power to imagine.  He does not
have the strength or the will to stop the tape.

a sound behind them.  The bedroom door is opening.  Tran
is standing there, stunned.  Maybe the first time he's
ever been surprised in his life.  What a way to start.
Like lightning we are off the bed snatching our .45 from
the night stand and whipping around... putting the muzzle
right in Tran's face.  We pull him roughly across the

madness.
The POV turns, looking out the window... staring fixedly
at burst after burst of brilliant fireworks.  Like the
fireworks inside Tran's head.
THE TAPE ENDS.
Lenny takes off the trodes.  He is wrung out, drenched

1609||"BLAM!  BLAM!  Max fires wildly, trying to hit Lenny, who
is just barely keeping the muzzle out of his face.  Faith
grabs Max's hair, trying to pull him away...
His ""hair"" comes off in her hands.  A prosthetic wig,
containing the squid-net array.  Max's head is shaved to a
Sinead O'Connor stubble.  He looks demonic, grimacing with
effort as he struggles with Lenny.
He continues firing.  The shots hit the mirrors.  ANGLES
of the reflected images of them shattering.  Faith,
screaming, reflected, her face fragmenting into shards.
The crystal chandelier shatters, reigning glassy snow on
them from above.
Max is stronger and heavier than Lenny, but Lenny has one
advantage: Max has managed to make him really angry.
Lenny gives a guttural cry and drives Max backward into
the doorframe.  They tumble together into the living room,
falling together over the couch.  Lenny pounds Max's hand
against the glass coffee table, shattering it.  He forces
Max's hand along a glass edge, cutting it, and Max drops
the gun.  Lenny reaches for it, but Max kicks it away a
split-second before his hand touches it.  It skitters
under the couch, out of play.
Max punches Lenny brutally in the face, then in the gut,
and grabs him with both hands.  He hurls him against the
wall.  Lenny staggers off the wall into several vicious
punches from Max.  We feel the tide turning.  Lenny goes
down to one knee.
Max pulls out his knife and flicks it open.  Lenny throws
a lamp.  Max ducks and charges through.  Lenny spins away
from the downthrust.
The knife embeds itself in his shoulder blade, sunk into
the bone.  Lenny punches Max in the throat and jerks away,
pulling the knife handle out of Max's hand.  Max tackles
him and they crash together through a sliding glass door
onto the balcony.  Explosion of flying glass.
Max pulls a dazed Lenny to his feet and rushes him
backward toward the railing.  At the last instant, Lenny
twists with all his strength and spins Max into the
railing, using his weight against him.  He pushes hard and
Max topples.
As he is going over, Max grabs Lenny's tie, pulling him
over.  Max is dangling 12 stories above the oblivious
crowd, his entire weight hanging from Lenny's tie.  Lenny
has one arm and one foot hooked around the railing, and he
is being strangled by the tie.
Lenny is starting to black out.  In agony he gropes with
his free hand to his own shoulder blade, finding the
handle of the knife.  He jerks it out of himself.  Max
sees it coming a split second before it happens.
Lenny slashes the knife across the tie, just above Max's
hands.
Max takes the express elevator to Hell.  He hits 12
stories down, on top of a video truck.
Lenny stands there panting, bleeding down the back of his
jacket.  Faith runs to the railing and looks down.  All
the strength goes out of her legs.  She sags to the floor.
Fireworks continue to boom across the sky.
Lenny looks down at her, gazing at the object of his
quest.  She looks up at him, her wet eyes seemingly at the
bottom of a deep well from which he cannot save her.
He turns and walks away.  It's hard.  But he keeps
walking."|stage direction

1611||EXT.  STREET - NIGHT|location
1612||"DOWN BELOW, in the madness of the crowd, we move with
Spreg as he searches for Mace.  He sees her from behind,
walking near one of the stages.  He moves up behind her,
aiming his pistol at the back of her head.  She turns
and...
... it isn't Mace.  Another girl in a similar dress.
Spreg curses and looks around.
Engelman catches a glimpse of Mace running.  He points to
her position and Spreg charges after her.  He has his
baton laid back along his forearm and is clubbing people
out of the way as he runs.
Mace sprints barefoot through the crowd, pushing people
out of her way.  Strobe-lights from the stage and flashes
from the fireworks give the crowd a nightmarish look.
Spreg fires at her.  People drop, their screams drowned
out by the pandemonium.  The gunshots don't register above
the concussions from the fireworks.  No one notices the
shootings.  Spreg continues to fire, missing her as people
block his shots.  Mace won't fire back in the crowd.
ON SPREG, coming to a stop at the base of a lighting
tower.  He has lost sight of her.  He starts to reload his
pistol.  Mace comes up to him silently from behind the
tower and hammer punches him behind the ear with the butt
of her pistol.
Spreg comes around with a roar, slamming the baton across
her forearm.  Her .380 clatters to the ground.  Mace
bodyslams him back against the steel tower, smashing her
palm up under his chin.  His head raps off the metal.
Mace is like a she-panther.  She rips the baton out of his
hands and cracks him once across the windpipe.  He drops
to his knees, gagging and unable to breathe.
A shot hits the metal space-frame next to her head.  She
spins to see Engelman, charging toward her.  Before he can
fire again she drops behind the kneeling, gasping Spreg,
using him as a human wall.  She clamps an arm around his
neck, controlling him, and pulls his tazer from his belt.
She shoots Engelman in the chest from 8 feet.  He
convulses and drops instantly to the pavement, flopping
like a fish.  She holds the current on him while she goes
over and kicks his gun away.
She takes Engelman's cuffs from his belt.  Spreg glares at
her through the blood running into his eyes.  She raises
the baton."|stage direction
1613|MACE|All the way down!  RIGHT NOW!!|speech
1614||"He slowly drops to the pavement, face down.  Now that
she's got them both proned out, she quickly handcuffs one
of Spreg's hands to one of Engelman's.
The crowd of partiers stares.  Can't believe what they're
seeing.  Mace takes Spreg's cuffs and attaches his other
wrist to the base of the tower.  That's when THREE LAPD
COPS in riot gear burst through the surrounding crowd and
see a black girl crouching over two of LA's finest with a
police baton.  The cops advance toward her."|stage direction
1615|MACE|"Wait.  Let me tell you what's going
on here--"|speech

to her hands and knees.  One of the cops kicks her down.

watches fascinated, gasping.
Mace sees another cop arrive and start to uncuff Spreg."|stage direction

cops.
And then they come out of the crowd... one, then three,
then half a dozen.  Just normal people... black, white,
Latino people... that can't watch this happen any more.
They jump the cops, swarming them, wrestling them down.
It becomes a brawl.
Then cops are running in from everywhere.  We see the
trigger point of a full-scale riot.  Cops in full riot-
gear, with Lexan shields, push the crowd back, clearing a
space.  A helicopter XENON comes straight down from above,
like the divine light of God.
Mace hugs herself, at the center of it, unable to get up.
Within seconds there are twenty cops there, and more on
the way, forming a human wall.  They get the crowd settled
down.
Through the phalanx of riot cops comes Palmer Strickland
and several ranking officers.  He surveys the scene.
Strickland looks down at Mace and then at Spreg and
Engelman, who are getting to their knees, though still
handcuffed to each other and the steel tower.  The beat
extends... Strickland unreadable, face stern as Moses.

blood.  Spreg clutches him, lowering him to the ground,
bathing in his blood.  You see him going insane, right at
that moment.  His face is suddenly demonic.
SPREG, the street-monster cop, RISES IN SLOW MOTION.  His
glare is fixed on Lenny and Mace.  He has Engelman's gun
in one blood-drenched hand.
Lifting the dead weight of Engelman by the handcuff, he
begins to drag the body, lurching toward Mace.  He keeps
the pistol down along his side.  Spreg exists at the
center of a circle of cops who don't know what to do.  He
has a gun so they can't rush him.  But he's a cop, so they

close.

opening the squad car door for her.  She turns away, her
