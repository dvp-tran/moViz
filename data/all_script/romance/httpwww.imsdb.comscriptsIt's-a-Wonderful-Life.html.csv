money. What does that get us? A
discontented, lazy rabble instead of
a thrifty working class. And all

fill their heads with a lot of
impossible ideas. Now, I say..."|speech

incensed by what Potter is saying about his father."|stage direction

hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right
when you say my father was no business
man. I know that. Why he ever started
this cheap, penny-ante Building and
Loan, I'll never know. But neither
you nor anybody else can say anything
against his character, because his
whole life was... Why, in the twenty-
five years since he and Uncle Billy
started this thing, he never once
thought of himself. Isn't that right,
Uncle Billy?  He didn't save enough
money to send Harry to school, let
alone me. But he did help a few people
get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.
And what's wrong with that? Why...
Here, you're all businessmen here.
Doesn't it make them better citizens?
Doesn't it make them better customers?
You... you said... What'd you say
just a minute ago?... They had to
wait and save their money before
they even ought to think of a decent
home. Wait! Wait for what? Until
their children grow up and leave
them?  Until they're so old and broken-
down that they... Do you know how
long it takes a working man to save
five thousand dollars?  Just remember
this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble
you're talking about... they do most
of the working and paying and living
and dying in this community. Well,
is it too much to have them work and
pay and live and die in a couple of
decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my
father didn't think so. People were
human beings to him, but to you, a
warped, frustrated old man, they're
cattle. Well, in my book he died a
much richer man than you'll ever be!"|speech
668|POTTER|"I'm not interested in your book. I'm
talking about the Building and Loan."|speech

you can't get your fingers on, and
it's galling you. That's what you're

the Board here. You do what you want

have some place where people can
come without crawling to Potter.

people hate me. But I don't like
them either, so that makes it all
even. You know just as well as I do
that I run practically everything in
this town but the Bailey Building
and Loan. You know, also, that for a
number of years I've been trying to
get control of it... or kill it. But
I haven't been able to do it. You
have been stopping me. In fact, you
have beaten me, George, and as anyone
in this county can tell you, that
takes some doing. Take during the
depression, for instance. You and I
were the only ones that kept our
heads. You saved the Building and
Loan, and I saved all the rest."|speech

all the rest."|speech

even be able to save the ten. Now,
if this young man of twenty-eight
was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd
say he was doing fine. But George
Bailey is not a common, ordinary
yokel. He's an intelligent, smart,
ambitious young man — who hates his
job – who hates the Building and
Loan almost as much as I do. A young
man who's been dying to get out on
his own ever since he was born. A
young man... the smartest one of the
crowd, mind you, a young man who has
to sit by and watch his friends go
places, because he's trapped.  Yes,
sir, trapped into frittering his
life away playing nursemaid to a lot

the neck with a drawstring. It falls below his knees.  The
