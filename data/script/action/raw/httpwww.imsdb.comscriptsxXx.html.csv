sure he's heard something.
But there's nothing there. He continues on.
Then the Intruder comes sliding down the ZIP-LINE from above.
WHAM! He kicks the Hacker into the wall, knocking him out.
The Intruder pulls off his mask, revealing the chiseled
features of a dashing BRITISH SECRET AGENT. His name is
STERLING."|stage direction

10||"Sterling searches the Hacker and pulls a SMALL BLACK CASE
from his coat. Inside the case is a DATA CHIP. Sterling tucks
it away.
Sterling unzips his black jumpsuit, revealing a crisp TUXEDO
underneath. He pulls out CAR KEYS. In a quick insert we see
the ""ASTON-MARTIN"" LOGO.
As he strolls back out the alley, he HEARS something and
flattens against the wall.
A BLACKED OUT SUV screeches to a stop, blocking his exit.
The SUV's HEADLIGHTS illuminate the slumped Hacker.
BAD GUYS get out to investigate, pulling out weapons.
Cornered, Sterling heads deeper into the alley, staying in
the shadows. He gets to that DOOR the Hacker was heading
towards.
As he PICKS THE LOCK Sterling can hear MUSIC from inside. He
smooths his hair and prepares to ""blend in"" with the crowd."|stage direction

12||"Sterling comes through the door and his face falls. He's
stepped into a loud METAL CONCERT.
We see a GO-GO DANCER in LATEX. Onstage is RAMMSTEIN, a
bizarre German industrial-metal band.
The tattooed YOUNG CROWD slam dances and swings glo-stix
over their heads. Some wear rubber BRAIN SKULLCAPS outfitted
with fiber optic lights. It's a sea of SPIKED HAIR and BONDAGE
OUTFITS.
Sterling squares his jaw and starts pushing through the crowd.
With his tuxedo he sticks out like a penguin in a chicken
coop.
ON THE BALCONY ABOVE THE CROWD stands a wild haired young
GANGSTER with PIERCED BROWS. With him is a STREET-TOUGH GIRL
with multi-colored hair. They look like a post-Apocalyptic
Bonnie & Clyde. They are YORGI and PETRA.
Yorgi checks his watch. His delivery is late. Then his CELL
PHONE rings. He's getting the news from outside.
He looks down, spots Sterling amidst the moshing crowd. With
that look, that tux, there's no mistaking what he is.
They make EYE CONTACT and Sterling gives a little nod.
Yorgi calmly issues orders into his phone.
Immediately VIKTOR starts moving in Sterling's direction.
Viktor is huge, with a MOHAWK and a six-inch GOATEE.
Sterling sees him advancing and makes for the exit, pushing
through the freaky crowd."|stage direction

The rear bumper of the spy car opens. SMOKE BOMBS drop out.
They explode in MASSIVE CLOUDS, obscuring the narrow, street.
Sterling skids around a corner.
The blinded bad guys drive straight into a STOREFRONT. Glass
and merchandise flies as the SUV gets stuck.
The Aston-Martin rounds another corner and slides to a stop.
Blocking the road ahead are two more SUV's.
A MOTORCYCLE slides to a stop in front of them. The rider is
ANDERS, a leather clad biker who looks half Viking.
Anders pulls out a SILENCED SUB-MACHINE GUN and starts
BLASTING.
BULLETS SLAM into the Aston-Martin, cracking the bullet-proof
glass, shattering headlights, and BLOWING OUT THE FRONT TIRES!
Sterling jams it into reverse and backs around the corner on
the RIMS."|stage direction

this data out of here.

BARGE.
PARTYGOERS in formal attire dance to an orchestra. A SWIMMING

Sterling is pushed back into his seat by the G-forces.
SPARKS fly from the rims as he skips across the pavement at
ever increasing speed.
Anders FIRES with his gun, but Sterling is getting away!
But then KIRILL steps around the corner. He's academic
looking, a CHAIN SMOKING intellectual with COKE-BOTTLE
GLASSES. He's also a highly proficient and cold-blooded
SNIPER.
Kirill puts his lit cigarette behind his ear and unslings a
SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILE LAUNCHER from his shoulder.
The Aston-Martin reaches the riverbank and goes AIRBORNE. It
ROCKETS through the air towards the party barge.
We see the car REFLECTED in Kirill's glasses as he AIMS.
On a little SCREEN we see the missile launcher HOME IN on
the HEAT SOURCE of the jet engine.
The missile locks-in and FIRES...
HEATSEEKER P.O.V. - we see a GREEN CAR with all its hot spots
GLOWING RED. Camera ROARS towards the flying car."|stage direction

Up position in front of the elevator doors armed with BILLY
CLUBS and TASERS.
DING! The elevator arrives and the door swings open. But
there's NOBODY INSIDE.
One Guard steps forward and suddenly a bicycle SWINGS DOWN
from the ceiling, TAGGING HIM IN THE FACE. He falls back,
TASERING another Guard.
Jacket Man drops down onto his bike and pedals through the
chaos before the Guards know what hit them. There's a CURVY
PIECE OF ART in the room, some kind of modern art statue.
Jacket Man rides up the artwork like a ramp and does a
TABLETOP AERIAL over a DIVIDER. He hits the ground pedalling,
the Guards hot after him.
Jacket Man enters a HUGE OPEN ROOM with a FIELD OF CUBICLES
in the middle. He bunny hops onto a desk and SLIDES TO A
STOP. He tosses back his hood and we get a good look at him
for the first time.
He is XANDER CAGE. He's got a shaved head, bizarre TATTOOS
all over his body and multiple PIERCINGS. He's lean and
heavily cut, even dangerous looking.
The Guards charge at him and he HOPS up onto the top of the
CUBICLE WALL. This thing is maybe FOUR INCHES WIDE and FIVE
FEET TALL.
He pedals across the top of the cubicle wall, the Guards
scrambling after him.
Xander bunny hops over one guy's head onto the next set of
cubicles and pedals hard. The Guards fall all over themselves
trying to catch him.
At the other end Xander catches air and lands on a CONFERENCE

Xander tears off his jacket, revealing a BACKPACK on his

TOP OF THE BUILDING. We're talking 90 some stories here.
He spins through the air, his bike on fire. He's doing end
over end backflips. One... Two... Three... Four...
He's looping through space on his bike, a crazy man on a
flaming bike against a backdrop of sleek skyscrapers and
night lights.
The stunt is covered by the various Accomplices and Xander's

got GEAR strapped to his back and it looks like it's been a
helluva climb.
Xander sits at the very peak and catches his breath. It's
beautiful up here.
He pulls a COLLAPSIBLE SNOWBOARD off his back, hits a switch
and the thing SWITCHBLADES OUT to full size. He clamps it on
his feet.
Xander moves to the edge and peers down. At the bottom of
the mountain he can see the CASTLE, an imposing medieval
fortress in the snow. He leans over the edge and starts down
the mountain. He doesn't get far before he notices something
else. He slides to a stop on the near vertical face, clinging
to rocks for balance.
On the mountain below him, between him and the castle, is a
GUARD OUTPOST. Right now he's in full view and he's been
spotted. He sees GUARDS scrambling out, hopping on

The grenade lands in the snow above him and starts ROLLING
DOWNHILL TOWARDS HIM. Xander pushes off and starts bombing
down the mountain.
The grenade bounces after him and then WHAM! It goes up with
a tremendous shock.
There is a SHIFT in the snow, a GROAN of shifting weight,
then the ENTIRE CORNICE cracks loose and topples over the
brink.
Xander streaks down the mountain with that wall of snow at
his heels.
From down below it's an awesome sight. The slack-jawed Guards
watch as tons of churning snow bear down on them.
Shooting in and out of that powdery mass like a surfer, they
can see Xander skipping like a stone down the mountain face.
There's a mad scramble as Guards turn their snowmobiles and
ride for their lives. A furious Viktor spins around and makes
a run for it as well.
Nobody has a chance. The avalanche is coming like a freight
train, frothing like white water.
Xander blazes right through the scrambling Guards and hits a
JUMP. He goes soaring up and lands square on the sloped roof
of the Outpost.
The avalanche is right behind him, slamming down everything
and everyone in its way.
Guards are swallowed up and tossed, snowmobiles go tumbling
under the onslaught.
Xander grabs onto the chimney as the avalanche washes over
the Outpost. He holds on until the ocean of snow comes to a
stop.
Then it's all quiet.
Above him the slope is a battlefield of icy rubble. There's
nothing moving up there anymore. Xander pulls himself free.
Then he hears a gushing sound and a DEEP BENEATH THE SURFACE,
he sees the WARM ORANGE GLOW OF FLAME. It's Viktor and his
flame thrower. There's another SPURT and the glow fades for
good.
Xander boards to a rock and sits to catch his breath. He's
right above the Castle now. Then his communicator starts to

nerve agent, right?"|speech

to safely dispose of the nerve agent

break down and dissipate!"|speech

She pulls another pin and is ready to throw when Yorgi's

GRAZES Petra's arm."|stage direction

engine compartment.
Xander grabs Petra and jumps. Together they land in Yorgi's
boat. The grenade explodes and their boat slams into a bridge
support and shatters.
They are in the heart of the old city now. We see piazza's
full of tourists, markets packed with locals, children playing
in front of cathedrals. And on the river Yorgi and
Xander battle it out while Petra steers the boat."|stage direction

clobbers him and Xander falls to the edge of the boat. Petra
tries to help, but Yorgi slugs her in her wounded arm.
Xander can see Ahab just a few inches under as Yorgi grabs
him from behind in a chokehold."|stage direction

him and they both topple overboard.
They land on Ahab and both grab on. They punch and pummel
each other while desperately hanging on to the speeding
torpedo. It surfaces as it approaches the magnificent St.
Charles bridge.
On the bridge is a chaos of COPS, FIREMEN and CROWDS OF
PEOPLE. They are desperately trying to herd people away from
the river.
Xander pounds Yorgi's face and dunks him underwater. Yorgi
slips and falls back to the tail section, dragging along in
the torpedo's wake.
Ahab starts making noise and it's payload doors swing open.
Inside Xander can see the row of glass cannister containing
Silent Night. The first one rises up into FIRING POSITION."|stage direction

BEEPING menacingly.
IN SLO-MOTION - Xander blinks at the liquid death in his
hands. He looks over at Petra. She's shouting at him, but he
doesn't hear a thing but his own HEARTBEAT.
He looks the other direction, to the mass of PEOPLE on the
bridge above him. Total strangers...
The fate of the whole world is in the hands of a former
nihilist.
Through the crowd, Xander sees Gibbons break through with
his squad of Agents. Gibbons and Xander make eye contact.
Then Yorgi lunges onto his back, trying to pull him into the
water. Xander HITS BUTTONS on the control panel and Ahab
starts to DIVE."|stage direction

down and stuffs it BACK IN THE LAUNCHER.
Ahab heads down to the bottom of the river, the two men
fighting.
We see one man get THROWN FREE, the other is caught up on
Ahab and continues downstream.
Then the booster rocket FIRES, giving off SPARKS and BUBBLES.
It's all in silhouette now as WHAM! The rocket EXPLODES,
setting off a CHAIN REACTION. WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! Ahab and
it's unfortunate passenger are DISINTEGRATED by the BLASTS.

Gibbons and his men push through the cordon of POLICE,
scanning the water. Nothing.
Tears well in Petra's eyes. Even Gibbons looks dejected.
Then Petra let's out a gasp and they look downstream.
There's a boat ramp leading into the water. At first they
see a ripple, then the top of a SHAVED HEAD emerges.
The whole crowd looks on as Xander rises from the water,
walking up the boat ramp.
His shirt is tattered, his tattooed body battered. But there's
a look on his face, a calm, a self-confidence we haven't
seen before. The Phoenix has risen.
Petra runs down to him and throws her arms around him. Xander
shakes Ivan 2's hand and then turns to Gibbons."|stage direction
