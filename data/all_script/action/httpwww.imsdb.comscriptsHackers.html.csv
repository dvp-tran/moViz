Rottweiler snarls and barks. In position, their comrades
point M-16s into first-floor windows, ready to be
ambushed. Pan into a window in the kitchen. An
attractive woman in her thirties is making breakfast.
Now, in regular motion, the battering ram breaks open the
front door. The woman, startled, drops her spatula."|stage direction
