This is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place
in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names
have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been
told exactly as it occured.
FLARE TO WHITE
FADE IN FROM WHITE
Slowly the white becomes a barely perceptible image:  white
particles wave over a white background.  A snowfall.
A car bursts through the curtain of snow.
The car is equipped with a hitch and is towing another car,
a brand-new light brown Cutlass Ciera with the pink sales
sticker showing in its rear window.
As the car roars past, leaving snow swirling in their dirft,
the title of the film fades in."|stage direction|||

MINNESOTA/FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA.  The roads for the two cities
diverge.  A sign says WELCOME TO NORTH DAKOTA and another
just after says NOW ENTERING FARGO, ND, POP. 44,412.
The car pulls into a Rodeway Inn.

THROUGH A WINDSHIELD
We are pulling into the snowswept parking lot of a one-story

identifies it as the Jolly Troll Tavern.  A troll, also in
neon, holds a champagne glass aloft.
INSIDE
The bar is downscale even for this town.  Country music
plays on the jukebox.
Two men are seated in a booth at the back.  One is short,
slight, youngish.  The other man is somewhat older, and
dour.  The table in front of them is littered with empty
long-neck beer bottles.  The ashtray is full.

Jean, sobbing, frantically pushes at buttons on the princess

The phone pops out of her hands, jangles across the tile
floor, smashes against the door and then bounces away, its
cord ripped free.
With a groaning sound, the door shifts in its frame.
BEDROOM
Grimsrud has a crowbar jammed in between the bathroom door
and frame, and is working it.
BATHROOM
Jean crosses to a high window above the toilet and throws it
open.  Snow that had drifted against the window sifts
lightly in.  Jean steps up onto the toilet.
The door creaks, moving as one piece in its frame.
Jean glances back as she steps up from the toilet seat to
the tank.
The groaning of the door ends with the wood around its knob
splintering and the knob itself falling out onto the floor.
The door swings open.
Grimsrud and Carl enter.
THEIR POV
Room empty, window open.
Carl strides to the window and hoists himself out.
Grimsrud opens the medicine cabinet and delicately taps
aside various bottles and tubes, seeking the proper unguent.
He finds a salve but after a moment sets it down, noticing
something in the mirror.
The shower curtain is drawn around the tub.
He steps toward it.
As he reaches for the curtain, it explodes outward, animated
by thrashing limbs.
Jean, screaming, tangled in the curtain, rips it off its
rings and stumbles out into the bedroom.  Grimsrud follows.
BEDROOM
Jean rushes toward the door, cloaked by the shower curtain
but awkwardly trying to push it off.
UPSTAIRS LANDING
Still thrashing, Jean crashes against the upstairs railing,
trips on the curtain and falls, thumping crazily down the
stairs.
Grimsrud trots down after her.

He sits eating a Swanson's TV dinner from a TV tray he has
set up in front of an easy chair.
He watches the old black-and-white TV set whose image - it
might be a game show - is still heavily ghosting and
diffused by snow.  The audio crackles with interference.
Despite the impenetrability of its image, it holds
Grimsrud's complete attention.
At the sound of the front door opening, Grimsrud looks up.
Carl enters, his face suppurating and raw.

1152||"ROAD EXTERIOR
Marge pulls her prowler over some distance past the cabin.
She gets out, zips up her khaki parka and pulls up its fur-
lined hood.
For a moment, she stands listening to the muffled roar of
the power tool.  Then, with one curved arm half pressing
against, half supporting her belly, she takes slow, gingerly
steps down the slope, through the deep snow, through the
trees angling toward the cabin and the source of the
grinding noise.
She slogs from tree to tree, letting each one support her
downhill-leaning weight for a moment before slogging to the
next.
The roar grows louder.  Marge stands panting by one tree,
her breath vaporizing out of her snorkel hood.  She squints
down toward the cabin's back lot.
A tall man with his back to us, wearing a red plaid quilted
jacket and a hunting cap with earflaps, is laboring over a
large power tool which his body blocks from view.
Marge advances.
The man is forcing downward something which engages the
roaring power tool and makes harsh spluttering noises.
The man is Grimsrud, his nose red and eyes watering from the
cold, hatflaps pulled down over his ears.  His breath steams
as he sourly goes about his work, both hands pressing down a
shod foot, as it if were the shaft of a butter churn.
The roar is very loud.
Marge slogs down to the next tree, panting, looking.
Grimsrud forces more of the leg into the machine, which we
can now see sprays small wet chunks out the bottom.
Marge's eyes shift.
A large dark form lies in the snow next to Grimsrud.
Grimsrud works on, eyes watering.  With a grunt he bends
down out of frame and then re-enters holding a thick log.
He uses it to force the leg deeper into the machine.
Marge is advancing.  She holds a gun extended toward
Grimsrud, who is still turned away.
Grimsrud rubs his nose with the back of his hand.
Marge closes in, grimacing.
Grimsrud's back strains as he puts his weight into the log
that pushes down into the machine.
The dark shape in the snow next to his side is the rest of
Carl Showalter's body.
Marge has drawn to within twenty yards.  When she bellows it
sounds hollow and distant, her voice all but eaten up by the
roar of the power tool."|stage direction|||
1153|MARGE|"Stop!  Police!  Turn around and
hands up!"|speech|MARGE|F|True
1154||"Startled, Grimsrud scowls.  He turns to face her.

Marge bellows again:"|stage direction|||

shoulder the armpatch insignia."|stage direction|||
1157|MARGE|...  Police!|speech|MARGE|F|True
1158||"Grimsrud stares.
With a quick twist, he reaches back for the log, hurls it at
Marge and then starts running away.
Marge twists her body sideways, shielding herself.
No need - the heavy log travels perhaps ten yards and lands
in the snow several feet short of her.
Grimsrud pants up the hill - slow going through the deep
snow.
Behind him:"|stage direction|||
1159|MARGE|...  Halt!|speech|MARGE|F|True
1160||"She fires in the air.
She lowers the gun and carefully sighs."|stage direction|||
1161|MARGE|...  Halt!|speech|MARGE|F|True

Marge sights again."|stage direction|||
1163|MARGE|...  Halt!|speech|MARGE|F|True
1164||"She fires again.
Grimsrud pitches forward.  He mutters in Swedish as he
reaches down to clutch at his wounded leg.
Marge walks toward him, gun trained on him as her other hand
reaches under her parka and gropes around her waist.
It comes out with a pair of handcuffs, which she opens with
a snap of the wrist."|stage direction|||
1165|MARGE|"...  All right, buddy.  On your
belly and your hands clasped
behind you."|speech|MARGE|F|True
1166||"THE CRUISER

behind him.

grimly shakes her head."|stage direction|||
