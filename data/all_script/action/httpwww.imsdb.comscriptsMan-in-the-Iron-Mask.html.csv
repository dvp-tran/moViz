FIRST DRAFT

1||"FADE IN:
From the BLACKNESS before the first images, we hear a young
woman's tortured SCREAM, muffled by her own will.  We see her
mouth, open in agony; her face, beaded with sweat.  Her name
is ANNE, and she is Queen of France.  She lies in
A ROYAL BEDCHAMBER
The royal DOCTOR kneels at the foot of her bed; her own royal
mother grips her hands...
On the opposite side of the huge bedchamber, and separated
from the queen's bed by an artistically painted screen, are
royal ADVISORS sweating and anxious for any word to take to
their king.  They wince as the Queen moans again in the pain
of childbirth.
Her fingers claw out for help, but her Doctor ignores her
need to be touched and comforted; he is concerned only for
the baby.  Only her PRIEST, FATHER BELLES, sits at her head,
stroking her hair gently and rapidly whispering prayers."|stage direction
2|DOCTOR|"The head is born!  One arm... the
other arm... it is a boy!"|speech

the screen to see the doctor lift the beautiful baby, wet
with birth.  The mother -- the Queen -- is still in agony,
yet she struggles to lift her head."|stage direction

this great news to the King is interrupted as the Queen emits
another cry; it surprises the doctor."|stage direction

9|DOCTOR|Another...?  It is another!|speech

12||"A DARK COURTYARD - NIGHT
A door groans open in a hidden corner of the palace courtyard
and into the darkness steps a dashing figure.  His face is
hidden in shadow, but we know from the silhouette of his
cloak and plumed hat that he is a MUSKETEER.
He carries an OBLONG BASKET.
A carriage is just rattling onto the flagstones of the
courtyard.  The Musketeer steps into its interior, with a
sharp word to the driver --"|stage direction

southern coast of France stands an island fortress, a prison,
like an Alcatraz of the Mediterranean.  Just off a coastline
renowned for its beauty, the fortress is horrible and

20||"With the camera as our moving POV, we survey the prison.  It
is a horrible place:  dungeons where prisoners lie in their
own filth; corners where jailers rut with unresisting captive
women; long twisting corridors lined with cells, from which
prisoners whimper, or moan in madness.  Up a long winding
staircase our POV moves; we push through the barred window of
a cell... It is somewhat cleaner than the rest of the places
we've seen, but still a prison.  We PAN the cell.
And we see a man.  A MAN IN AN IRON MASK.  It is terrifying,
to think of anyone imprisoned in this way.  We push in on his
eyes... They are blue, childlike.
A greasy jailer -- the prisoner's KEEPER -- puts his face to
the barred window of the door, and speaks with bored cruelty."|stage direction

27||EXT.  PARIS STREET - NIGHT|location
28||"Through the narrow streets of the old city gallops a dashing
figure, his cloak flying behind him and catching the
moonlight, his horse's hooves clattering along the
cobblestones as he dodges the beggars living in the filthy
shadows.  He is a magnetic sight, riding the horse as easily
as if they were racing across an open field and not through a
cluttered street, and guiding the stallion as if its grace
and power came not from the animal but from the rider.
Sitting lightly in the saddle is
D'ARTAGNAN
famous Musketeer, Captain of the King's Royal Bodyguard.  He
is still handsome at mid-life, still erect, unambiguous in
his courage and his loyalty.
He rides past a knot of angry beggars, moving through the
streets breaking windows and scavenging for food.  When they
see d'Artagnan, some throw rocks at him.  They sail by
d'Artagnan's head; he ducks them with the fluid grace of a
boxer dodging punches, and keeps on riding.
OUTSIDE THE CATHEDRAL
D'Artagnan rides into the courtyard of a grand old residence
beside Notre Dame Cathedral.  Priests are dispensing food to
beggars gathered in the courtyard.  As d'Artagnan reins his
horse to a stop the wretched people stare with contempt at
the royal symbols on his uniform.  But d'Artagnan is not a
man anyone would be quick to confront; as he dismounts and
moves toward the doorways the people part for him.
He pauses as he sees, parked to one side of the old
residence, a big rickety carriage.  D'Artagnan smiles."|stage direction

women, bosoms spilling from their gaudy dresses; the fourth
is PORTHOS, the former Musketeer, now a nobleman of great
wealth and even greater girth.  He and the women are drinking
wine as they stagger up the stairs, the women towing Porthos
like rowboats tugging a ship to dock.  Porthos is not so
drunk that his hands fail to find pleasant places to grip
their bodies as they walk and giggle."|stage direction

short at what she sees.  The second and third stumble in

see.  Then with a great roar Porthos barrels in."|stage direction

38||"He stops dead in his tracks.  From the POV OF PORTHOS AND THE
WOMEN, we see ARAMIS.  Always the most theological of the
Musketeers, and ruthlessly brilliant, he is still lean and
powerful.  And still handsome, or at least he would be; but
now he kneels before a single candle at a private altar,
wearing sackcloth and ashes in penitent prayer."|stage direction

enjoyed it too.  He's hung like a
donkey."|speech

it for fifteen years.  Go on now,
leave His Holiness alone.  I'll

a better mood."|speech

Aramis, heaving himself to a seat beside his praying friend."|stage direction

my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm
weak, my strength is gone --"|speech

see I'm praying?"|speech
45|PORTHOS|"I just said you're praying!  Are you
deaf too?  I know you're blind,
because if you had seen the tits
that just walked out of here, you'd
have tears in your eyes."|speech
46||(trying to ignore him)|location
47|ARAMIS|"There are more important things than
tits."|speech
48|PORTHOS|"Really?  If you can name me one
thing, one single thing, that is
more sublime than the feel of a
plump pink nipple between my lips,
I will buy you a new cathedral."|speech

sweeter than a plump nipple."|speech

goddammit?!"|speech

you."|speech

his royal emblem."|speech

sure enough, is the remnant of a broken egg."|stage direction

The King said, ""Right away.""  Cut
deep and hard, my friends."|speech

leaves, as Porthos shakes his head."|stage direction

I forgot.  For the poor, the ones
you were praying for."|speech

reaches for it.  Just as he takes the money, Porthos throws a
haymaker; but Aramis sees the sucker punch coming and ducks.

in a dark plain coat, he too is a former Musketeer -- gray
haired and handsome, intensely intelligent, with a hard crust
of manners masking seas of emotion.  He opens a small wooden
box and digs through medals of heroism; he finds what he's
looking for just as his son RAOUL enters.  RAOUL is in his
mid-twenties; he wears the uniform of a soldier in the French
Army.  He is nervous, pacing, looking at every angle in the
mirror."|stage direction

78|ATHOS|"None of the ladies will be able to
take their eyes off you."|speech
79|RAOUL|"I care only about Michelle.  Should
I ask her when we first arrive?
Or... or when we're leaving?  I
could ask her in the carriage -- but
it is more romantic at the palace.
I get so confused..."|speech

of Louis XIV's France, the men like peacocks, the ladies in
gowns that seem to squeeze their entire bodies up into their
bosoms.  They laugh and smile and strike courtly poses
pretending to talk with each other -- but all eyes are on the
doorway, through which the king is about to come...
JUST BEYOND THAT PALACE DOORWAY
KING LOUIS the Fourteenth is having his wardrobe adjusted by
a flock of tailors.  He is twenty-two, and would be quite
handsome, except for the total self-absorption.  He's
checking himself in a full length golden mirror as two of his
advisors, PIERRE and CLAUDE, try to speak with him."|stage direction

festive time, but before --"|speech

Majesty, but... as your advisors, we
feel it is our -- our --"|speech

95|PIERRE|"Yes!  It is our duty to let you
know... there are riots in Paris."|speech
96|LOUIS|"Riots?  My people live in the
world's most beautiful city, their
king has the grandest palaces on
earth.  Why should they feel
anything but pride and contentment?"|speech
97|PIERRE|"Well yes, of course, Majesty, and
I'm sure they are content... except
that... well, they are starving."|speech
98|LOUIS|"Sometimes the poor do grow hungry.
But why would they riot about it?"|speech
99||"As he says this, a replica of the Matterhorn made of fruits
and meringues is carried past the window by a team of chefs."|stage direction

food set aside for your birthday
celebration next week.  If we
distributed some of that, we would
have time to gather more before --"|speech

simple priest's robe -- strides forward and bows to the kind."|stage direction

Majesty?"|speech
106|LOUIS|"Next week.  This is a mere garden
party -- and I wish to join it, so I
will be brief.  I am experiencing
resistance from the Jesuits."|speech
107|ARAMIS|"Well... perhaps you should speak
with them, your Majesty."|speech
108|LOUIS|"I have demanded it -- and common
priests present themselves!  Can you
imagine the arrogance?  Common
Jesuit priests try to act as my
equals, and they refuse to reveal
the names of anyone else in their
order!  No one can keep secrets like
the Jesuits can, and the identity of
their leader is the darkest secret
they hold.  Even the Pope himself
does not know who leads the Jesuit
Order in France!  He suspects the
Governor General of Jesuits, whoever
he is, is angling to become Pope
himself."|speech
109|ARAMIS|How can I serve you in this?|speech
110|LOUIS|"Perhaps you can find out who this
secret leader of the Jesuits is.
You are now a priest, but you were
once a Musketeer, serving the throne
of France, a throne ordained of God.
Can you accept this mission, and
keep it private?"|speech
111|ARAMIS|"If I find out the identity of this
Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him
and the man who told me."|speech
112|LOUIS|"Once a Musketeer, always a
Musketeer, eh?"|speech
113||"Aramis bows and Louis turns back to his mirror.  There are
mirrors everywhere in his palace, and he loves his
reflection, adorned as he is all in golden cloth, like fabric
from the sun.  Aramis leaves and the advisors return."|stage direction

stocks on the wharves right now, no?"|speech
115|PIERRE|"That food has spoiled.  That is why
it was not shipped to the army."|speech

Majesty!"|speech

121|RAOUL|Michelle...|speech
122||"But just as he starts to speak, trumpets blast and the King
steps through the doors and out into the lavish gardens; the
party goers give him a rousing ovation.  Raoul returns the
ring to his jacket, to wait for another moment.
Everyone watches the King, who begins guzzling wine and
telling jokes to his sycophants, who howl at the King's
witticisms.  Then Louis catches sight of Raoul and Michelle,
and lowers his voice, to his FRIENDS..."|stage direction

secret service agents protecting a president.  He leaves

us pretend I am King and you are
Captain of my Musketeers.  Let us
behave as if my wish is law.  And my
wish is to enjoy this party!"|speech

D'Artagnan retreats, then looks back to Louis and follows his
gaze to the tender young beauty who caught his eye.

the hands of the king's dwarf, who holds the fat little
animal above his head and runs among the startled guests."|stage direction
143|LOUIS|"It pleases us to announce an
entertainment for our guests!  A
contest of agility and cunning!"|speech
144||"He takes the pig from his dwarf; the pig is clean and
perfumed, a colorful fake horn tied onto its head."|stage direction
145|LOUIS|"Behold our unicorn!  Whichever of
our guests captures the unicorn
shall win its treasure!"|speech
146||"With this announcement the King produces a diamond the size
of a pecan, suspended from a ribbon; the guests gasp at its
richness.  The King ties the diamond around the pig's neck.
RAOUL AND MICHELLE
Michelle is amazed at this."|stage direction
147|MICHELLE|"I have never seen a diamond so
large!"|speech
148||"It almost makes Raoul ashamed of the modest ring hidden in
his hand."|stage direction
149|LOUIS|"Into the maze!  All of you!
Disperse, I command you!"|speech
150||"The dwarf releases the pig, poking him through a tiny break
in the hedge; the critter skitters as only a pig can, eluding
the first laughing lunges of the guests.
THE PIG CHASE is a merry melee, as the maze becomes a tangle
of confusion.  LOUIS climbs to a platform above the top of
the ten foot hedge that forms the maze.  From his perch he
looks down on all the action, and calls encouragement."|stage direction
151|LOUIS|Are you men or mice?!|speech
152||"MICHELLE squeals as the pig scurries by and Raoul dives for
it.  He almost has the pig... then it kicks free."|stage direction
153|RAOUL|The pendant will be yours!|speech
154||"With that he races after the pig.
MICHELLE tries to follow, this way, that way, through the
maze.  Then she stops, face to face with the King, entering
through a gate hidden in one of the maze's dead corners."|stage direction
155|LOUIS|Michelle, isn't it?|speech
156||Speechless, she nods.|stage direction
157|LOUIS|"I would have said it was impossible,
but I believe the excitement of the
chase has made you even more
beautiful."|speech
158|MICHELLE|Sire, I --|speech
159|LOUIS|"You blush!  You do not wish to be
beautiful to your King?"|speech
160||"Her eyes go still; she understands what is happening.
FROM BEHIND THE GATE, we see d'Artagnan, watching as Louis
tries to seduce the young woman.  Even as d'Artagnan watches,
the pig comes rooting through the hedge; with a deft movement
d'Artagnan catches the animal's leg and lifts it with the
sureness of the farm boy he once was.  The pig is quiet and
comfortable in d'Artagnan's hands.
D'Artagnan watches as the King approaches Michelle, and she
allows him to touch her cheek.  The king leans to kiss her...
Michelle does not move...
WHHEEEKKKK!  The pig sails over the gate and hits the ground
running, right at Louis' feet; it sets him dancing.
The spell of the king's royal attention is shattered; as the
pig scrambles away, Michelle backs away."|stage direction
161|LOUIS|Wait!  Michelle, I --|speech
162||"Too late, he sees the shadow of the man looming above him,
leaping down onto him from the observation platform.  It is
the servant who offered the tray to Raoul and Michelle; he
has armed himself with a knife from the carving table, and is
diving now to plunge the blade into the king's throat.
The king is helpless, frozen.  The assassin leaps, falling
toward the king... and is impaled on the sword of d'Artagnan,
springing through the gate to save his king.
Michelle screams, the king gasps, and the assassin drops,
mortally wounded.  They stare down at him now; the would-be
assassin gurgles words through his agony..."|stage direction

Come, let us continue our chase!
Where is our unicorn?"|speech

they go again, laughing as if nothing happened.

plain table.  It has a single small window, and d'Artagnan
stands at it now, looking out into the Palace garden below.
The guests have all gone home; the party pavilions have been
cleared away.  And now in the blue dusk, a solitary lady
walks.  She is Anne of Austria, the Queen Mother, the lady we
saw in the opening.
Now, twenty years later, she is a slim frail figure.  Her
clothes are drab and simple, like the dress of mourning; she
walks in silence, watched at a distance by nun attendants.
She glances up, and sees d'Artagnan's form in the window.
When he sees her looking, he pulls away from the window."|stage direction

the mob overwhelming the soldiers and dragging them down the
streets in the direction of the palace.
D'ARTAGNAN, riding toward the palace himself, turns a corner

dashing Musketeer on the prancing stallion.

OFFICER who is no older than himself, but whose eyes are

The King is dancing and laughing with sexy young ladies.
D'Artagnan stands to the side of the ballroom, ever watchful,
ever remote.
As the dancers swirl, each one wearing a distinctive mask in
the garish style favored by the French nobility of the
1600's, we see one particular couple -- a large man, with an
excessively large woman.  They are dancing vigorously, and as
they take a break behind a huge pillar, they lift their masks
enough for us to see that the man is Aramis, and the ""woman""
is Porthos.

replicas of the iron mask that Phillippe once wore."|stage direction

baroque outer mask he's wearing and reveals an iron mask
beneath.
The King staggers, stopping.  The sight stuns him, confuses
him; he looks around but the wearer of the mask has
disappeared among the weaving patterns of dancers.  Louis'

He seems to have made it; people glance -- dancing ladies,
young Musketeers, old advisors -- but no one gives him a
second look.  For a moment, Phillippe feels safe.
And then he sees Michelle, her eyes glassy and riveted upon
him.  She wears her most beautiful gown -- the first one
Louis gave her -- but one shoulder strap dangles sloppily.
Her lips and cheeks are awkwardly rouged, her hair is mussed;
she is drunk.  She weaves her way to him and curtsies
elaborately."|stage direction

Phillippe realizes his blunder; they've caught him.
The MUSIC STOPS.  But the attention is not directed at the
throne; all eyes shift to the main doorway, where Anne has
appeared.  She is indescribably beautiful; she wears a bright
gown, her hair is brushed and bejeweled, she radiates the
light of a woman who felt old at thirty and who has
discovered, at forty, that she is more stunning than ever.
Her arrival draws even more attention than the reappearance
of the King; everyone watches transfixed as she approaches.
Phillippe sees her -- his mother.  He stands on legs that
seem to have no bones.  His mother.
She moves to him, her eyes filling with tears.  When she is
almost to the throne, Phillippe falls to his knees before her
and kisses her hand.
No one can believe it, not from this King.  Yet the moment
strikes them as beautiful, and they applaud happily.
Phillippe and the Queen Mother rise, and guide each other --
