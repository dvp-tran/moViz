1||"FADE IN:
In a Russian summer meadow, a young girl spins around and
around. A simple guitar theme plays as the low sun catches
her hair. Around her neck is a pair of field binoculars, and
she runs through the meadow with them pressed to her face,
spying butterflies, birds, rabbits. She reaches the top of a
hillock, and jumps into the air, and flies up into the sky.
We float up and up with her as she aims the binoculars up,
up, into the sun."|stage direction

3||"An aerial shot of the rolling English countryside. Nothing
but fields and trees for miles. The shot describes a panorama
before looking directly down, at the earth, and we begin to
move.
We fly low over a field, a ditch and straight out over six
lanes of motorway. Cars and lorries tear below at a hundred
miles an hour. We fly over the hard shoulder to another field
beyond.
We descend on two young boys in the field. A pornographic
magazine is spread out of the flattened grass. One of the
boys puts a match to the centre page and as the flames lick
up, we begin to move again, across the field, over a path
and into a suburban garden.
We fly over five or six gardens, over a barbecue, over
children splashing in a pool, over a woman sunbathing, a man
mowing his lawn, a young boy bouncing up and down on a garden
trampoline, to arrive on the patio of John Buckingham. He
walks out onto the patio, where he sits in a chair, facing
his house, setting down a mug of tea."|stage direction

Blackout. Music. Titles.
The titles pop and slide over footage of Russian women, on
computer video, advertising themselves. They mostly speak in
Russian, some of which is subtitled, some speak in English.
The women slide on and off the screen, overlap and collide,

He approaches the bed with immense trepidation, eases the
cigarette from between her fingers and drops it in the bin.
He stares at her bare hip, with the ash on it. Holding the
saucer under the ash, he blows on it gently. It takes three

Hands stacking bank notes into the back of a cash machine.
Fast, mechanical.
At the bank, John walks to his desk. His phone rings. He
answers it.
Silence. Then soft breathing. John listens intently and looks

Nadia's fingers, knitting skillfully.
Nadia sits on her bed alone, pulling on black stockings and
attaching them to suspenders.
The street cricketers run for cover as a thunder storm breaks
over the close.
Rain coming down in John's garden. The pair sit under the
shelter of the back porch. John has his hands out as Nadia
is winding red wool it into a ball. The jumper is half
finished.
The rabbits shelter from the rain under broad leaves.
John in a pub with a four colleagues from the bank. He sips
his half, half listening to the conversation. It all seems
so dull. He finishes his drink and looks at his watch. They
ask him if he's staying for another.
A knitting needle is drawn from a row of red stitches on the
nearly-finished jumper.
Nadia kneels over John holding the knitting needles. She
presses one to his skin and we watch it drawn across his
chest in close up, up to his neck.
His eyes are fixed on hers.
Close up on Nadia's face. Her mouth is gagged and she's lying
on her front, head half-buried in a pillow. We can just make
out John behind, on top of her. Both are lying still and
breathing hard, covered in sweat. Catching her breath Nadia
