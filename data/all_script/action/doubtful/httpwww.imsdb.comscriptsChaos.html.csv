A1   EXT.   PEARL STREET BRIDGE- NIGHT                               A1
CLOSE ON...   A BRONZE PLAQUE which reads, ""PEARL STREET
BRIDGE.""
ON THE BRIDGE... RAIN POURS DOWN. An SUV steers out of
control and CRASHES into a STALLED OUT VEHICLE.
It's quiet NOW, EXCEPT FOR THE INCESSANT pounding rain.    IN
THE DISTANCE, police lights approach.
SMASH CUT TO:
1    EXT.   PEARL STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT                              1
THROUGH A TELEVISION CAMERA... The image is GRAINY and
FRENETIC. A HEAVY RAIN POURS DOWN on a MELEE OF ACTIVITY.
POLICE CARS block either end, their LIGHTS ignite the sky in
a dizzying RED and BLUE design. The attention centers on...
The SUV and the CRASHED VEHICLE lay in the middle of the
bridge. A MAN, 30's, madness on his face, his right hand
holds a HOSTAGE, a woman, 20's, racked with fear, tight to
his body. His left holds a GUN!
Two DETECTIVES, slowly approach the Man.   ONLY SEE THE
DETECTIVES FROM BEHIND.
A News Reporter, KAREN CROSS, 30's, blond with energy to
burn, shields herself from the rain, steps in front of the
camera..."|unknown
1|KAREN CROSS|"... Police on scene are approaching
the suspect. They're at the center of
the Bridge now."|speech

Hostage, tears streaming down her face, SCREAMS OUT!

SUDDENLY...   THREE GUN SHOTS, almost simultaneously, RING
OUT!

2    INT.   LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - NIGHT                 2
A loft apartment, scarcely furnished, except for BOOKS,
HUNDREDS OF THEM, fill stacks of shelves. Hearing but not
watching the television, METICULOUSLY preparing a GIN AND
TONIC, is...
DETECTIVE QUENTIN CONNERS, a grizzled, intense veteran. His
charisma, which he has in spades, gets him into as much
trouble as it gets him out of. At present a somber mood.
The shadows from the rain stream down Conners's face.
IN THE GLASS'S REFLECTION... The TV Report plays. (NOTE:
most of, if not all, of the TV report will in reflection.)"|unknown
5|KAREN CROSS (OS)|"After a two month investigation, Det.
Jason York has been relieved of duty
for his role in the Pearl Street Bridge

women entrusted with serving and
protecting the community are to be held
accountable just like everyone else.
Simply put... Just because you are a

Conners turns off the TV, lays the remote next to a PHOTO of

4    EXT.   SEATTLE - DAY - ESTABLISHING                               4
A COOL, CRISP Pacific Northwestern day. MOUNT RAINIER looms
in the distance. The SPACE NEEDLE overlooks downtown. While
the sun shines now, the OVERCAST SKY on the horizon
FORESHADOWS AN IMPENDING STORM. In the heart of the city...
5    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                               5
An IMPRESSIVE STRUCTURE on a BUSY CITY CORNER. TRAFFIC,

LORENZ, 40's, sits behind the steering wheel. His EYES cold,
merciless. He's joined by FOUR OTHER MEN, ALL BLACK CLAD -
HEAVILY ARMED with BODY ARMOR!
Lorenz stares out at the bank, a last moment of peace.
Simultaneously, ALL FOUR DOORS OPEN and...
7    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                               7
Lorenz and the Black Clad exit, quickly cross the street,

7A   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                             7A
PATRONS in line, wait impatiently. A SECURITY GUARD in the
corner yawns. TELLERS count out cash, access accounts on
COMPUTERS.
GRAINY SECURITY CAMERA IMAGES depict an average, business
day. THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.

CONNERS
Shane, what was that thing you said
back at the house about ""returning to
the beginning path"" or something?
DEKKER
It's a Buddhist story.
CONNERS
We're all ears.
DEKKER
One day the Buddha found his heart in
turmoil. So he retreats to the forest,
to the earth, to the base of a great
tree and, I'm paraphrasing, but... this
elephant comes up and tells Buddha he
doesn't like seeing him discouraged.
TEDDY
He can talk to an elephant?
DEKKER
He's the Buddha. He's attained the 6th
level of consciousness. He's capable
of communicating with plants, trees...
even rocks.
VINCENT
Rocks?

Jenkins stands before Conners, Dekker, Teddy, Vincent and two

KNIGHT, 50's.
JENKINS
He's also the brother of John Curtis,
the perp Conners shot at Pearl Street
Bridge.
(Moving on)
Richards testifies that he was hired by
Curtis to pull the bank job with a
dirty cop on the inside, Bernie Callo.
Curtis hoped that Conners would take
the fall for American National turning
ugly, disgracing him even further. We
also have the names of two more
accomplices, Lamar Galt and Xander
Harrington. Everyone was set to meet
tonight at ten and we have that
address.

know Curtis is eliminating his

Finish what he started. Every day he
went out, trying to do some good. Help
the people who couldn't help
themselves, just give'em a chance is

work out right, but he tried. You

Yeah. Any deposit or withdrawal from
