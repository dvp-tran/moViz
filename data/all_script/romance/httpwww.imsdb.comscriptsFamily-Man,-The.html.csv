A look of confusion crosses his face...trying to
remember... did he meet a woman last night...?
He turns his head to find a large MUTT sitting
faithfully beside the bed, wagging his tail...
...did she have a dog?
He looks down at the woman again, craning his neck to
get a look at her face.  And then he sees her...
...KATE REYNOLDS...
...now 34 and even more beautiful, a look of utter
contentment on her radiant face, sleeping soundly...
His head darts around the room - it’s cramped and lived
in, clothes and toys are strewn about, family photos on
the dresser, Laura Ashley curtains, a tiny poster bed
and a charming little bay window.
He instinctively reaches for his Franck Mueller watch
on the night stand, but it’s not there.  It’s a Timex
Indiglo and it reads, “7:57 A.M...”

That’s it.  Jack moves the baby gingerly over, then

next to it.
He picks up the bat...the same Willie Mays autograph

Frightened, Jack drops the bad, looking down at himself

He puts the leather jacket on, then sticks the Mondale
button on the lapel.  He digs back into the box,

A messy, dog-eared copy of “Cat’s Cradle”...not the one
Kate gave him at the airport, the one she replaced...
