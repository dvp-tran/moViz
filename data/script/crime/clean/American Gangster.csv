foreground snow: Soldiers in the jungles of Vietnam in
1970. A rich, cultured, authoritative voice offers:
BUMPY O/S
This is the problem. This is what's
wrong with America.
The war footage multiplies by twenty: a stack of TVs with
price tags dangling from the knobs behind a display window.
BUMPY O/S
It's gotten so big you can't find your
way.
People on the sidewalk, out of respect or fear, part to let
Frank and Bumpy and Bumpy's German shepherd pass.
BUMPY
The corner grocery's a supermarket.
Candy store's a MacDonald's. And this

Where's the pride of ownership here?
Where's the personal service? Does
anybody work here?
Inside, the emporium is vast, with aisles that seem to
stretch off into infinity. The TVs give way to a display
window full of Japanese stereo componentry.
BUMPY
What right do they have cutting out the
suppliers, pushing all the middlemen out,
buying direct from the manufacturer -
Sony this, Toshiba that, all them Chinks -
putting Americans out of work?
He's not really asking Frank, so Frank doesn't answer.
BUMPY
What am I supposed to do with a place
like this, Frank? Who am I supposed to
ask for, the assistant manager?
(pause)
This is the problem. This is the way it
is now: You can't find the heart of
anything to stick the knife.
Bumpy stops before a display of cameras and stares in.
They're all pointed at him as a pain grips his chest and he
sinks to his knees. Frank kneels down.
FRANK
What is it?
Bumpy seems unable to speak, looks to Frank confused.
FRANK
Somebody call an ambulance!
But the store suddenly seems empty. Frank yells into the
emporium but can't be heard above the Muzak and the cash
registers ringing up sales Bumpy will never see a piece of.
Looking up at Frank, Bumpy manages weakly -
BUMPY
Forget it, Frank. No one's in charge."|unknown|||

16||"The report continues on a TV no one's really watching here:
a March of Time-like history of Bumpy Johnson, famed Harlem
gangster, Robin Hood and killer.
REPORTER ON TV
He was a Great Man, according to the
eulogies. A giving man. A man of the
people. No one chose to include in their
remembrances the word most often
associated with Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson:
Gangster.
Sitting off by himself in Bumpy's elegant garden apartment,
heretofore his private sanctuary, Frank surveys the mourners
circling the place like vultures:
Tango Black, a huge brute, scavenging the catered food and
tended bar ... Jackie Fox, surrounded by his ever-present
coterie of sycophants ... Albert Tosca, an elegant Italian
capo, and an underling, Rossi, at the bar.
TOSCA
White wine, please.
A white man who looks like a banker - and is - sits down
next to Frank.
BANKER
How you doing, Frank?
FRANK
All right.
BANKER
What a loss.
(Frank nods)
How are you otherwise?   Things okay
financially?

18||"Frank doesn't say. It feels unseemly to him to be talking
about money here. He watches Tango carelessly set a watery
glass of ice on an antique inlaid chess table.
BANKER
Bumpy set something up for you?
Frank excuses himself without an answer, crosses to where
Tango left the glass, and sets it on a coaster.
TANGO
Hey, Frank, get me an ashtray while
you're at it.
Bumpy's German shepherd watches as Frank reaches into his
jacket, revealing a gun nestled in its shoulder holster. He
takes out a handkerchief, wipes the condensation dry, opens
a drawer and removes an ashtray. He holds it out to Tango -
who isn't sure it's not a dare and decides to wander off.
CHARLIE
I know you're hurting, Frank.    So am I.
Frank sits back down with Charlie Williams, an older dope
man.
CHARLIE
You going to be all right?
FRANK
Yeah.
CHARLIE
I'm sure Bumpy never told you, but he
made me promise, anything ever happened
to him, I'd make sure you didn't go
without.
FRANK
I'll be fine, Charlie. Half the people
here owed Bumpy money when he died. A
lot of money. If they think I'm going
to forget to collect, they're wrong.
CHARLIE
That's the spirit. Go get them.
On the TV, over archive film and photographs of crime
figures from the 1940's and `50's, the opinion is offered
that Bumpy's death ""marks the end of an era ...""

They get physically ill. They throw up.

Hey -
Rivera flashes a New Jersey detective's shield without
breaking stride. Takes a subpoena out of another pocket.
RIVERA
Who's going to do this?
RICHIE
He knows me, he'll take it from me.
I've known him since high school.
RIVERA
Just throw it in, he doesn't take it.
That's good service.
They reach a particular motel room door. Rivera knocks.
The door opens the length of a chain, revealing a wise guy
in an undershirt, who, when he sees the subpoena, start to
close the door -
RIVERA
Throw it -
As Richie flings the subpoena in, the door slams on his
hand. He wails in agony, tries to shoulder it open, hears
the dead bolt lock on the other side, feels Campizi's teeth
bite into his fingers, watches his blood run down the frame.

Richie beats at him before Rivera can pull him off."|unknown|||

I swear to God, Richie, I didn't know it
was you. I would never slam a door on
your hand. Knowingly.
RICHIE
You bit my fuckin hand -
Richie lunges at him, hits him again with his injured hand -
which hurts Richie more than it does Campizi. The
paramedics manage to pull him away.
CAMPIZI
What can we do, Richie? You don't want
to do this. For old times sake, what can
we do? Who do you want? Who can I give
you? You want Big Sal's bookie? You want
his accountant? I'll give him to you.
Richie regards him a moment. A policy ring's accountant
wouldn't be bad. He glances back to his paramedic dabbing
at his bloody hand, and notices she's not bad-looking. She
smiles back."|unknown|||

Frank, the pats on his back, lipsticked mouths of beautiful
women offering kisses and words of encouragement, his old
mother giving him a hug.
He watches Frank's head turn slowly, his eyes passing his
phalanx of attorneys, the jury, finally settling on Richie
in his cheap suit seated at the prosecutors table.
Frank's eyes smile as they regard Richie, and seem to ask,
Can you see this - can you see what you're up against - can
you see how insignificant you are?
Reaching the end of the welcoming line finally, Frank
brushes by Richie and disappears from view somewhere within
the protective husk of his multi-million-dollar legal team."|stage direction|||
