1  EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                               1
Garish purple light spills out of side-street porno houses,
illuminating a silhouette, and little else, of a MAN leaning
against an alley wall.
He is waiting.
Another silhouetted FIGURE appears and approaches the first.
They size each other up as best they can."|unknown
1|FIRST MAN|MacLeod.|speech

The first without hesitation raises a sword, the intended
thrust interrupted by his own death as the second with a flash
of metal severs the agressor's head.
2  INT. HUTCH - MORNING                                              2
A 15th century Scottish home.
A haggard WOMAN, her small CHILD clinging to a tattered apron,
stands hunched over a glowing hearth.  Her veined hands drag
a wooden spoon around and around through a soot-covered pot
of grey soup.
From an adjoining room CONOR MACLEOD, a young man dressed up
in his best traditional Celtic tartan, enters."|unknown

the cottage door.
Conor's father steps out to meet them.

The second kneels to examine the headless body of the first.
With a CLACK a window, high on the alley wall, closes.
6  EXT. HIGHLAND PLAIN - MORNING                                     6
The DUKE is leading a brigade of CLANSMEN out onto the plain.
Mounted VASSALS ride back and forth inspecting the line.  The
low fog makes it impossible to see beyond a few yards.  There
is an erie, smothering silence."|unknown

The Knight, above the fog, hears the battle commence below.
He spurs his horse and starts down into the mist.
8  EXT. PLAIN - MORNING                                              8
The two opposing clans are now one confused mass of tartan
and clashing swords.  The air is charged with SHOUTS of ex-
citement, agony, and the SHRILL of bag pipes.
The fog has made each man's battle his own, each isolated with
his opponent.
THE KNIGHT
Rides calmly through the fracas.  He strikes and kills those
that assault him, but appears disinterested in battle.
He is looking.
CONOR
Is standing above the twitching body of his friend.
Alone and confused, Conor has become seperated from the clan.
He stumbles through the fog, seeking help.
Suddenly he is alone with the Knight.
The face of iron locks its gaze onto the boy.  His fear turned
to panic, Conor turns and flees.
The Knight, his resolve steeled in a raised sword, kicks his
horse into persuit.
Conor is easily overtaken and on his first pass the Knight
brings his blade down hard into Conor's shoulder, slicing
open most of the boy's back and knocking him face-first into
the heather.
As Conor watches his own blood spew forth, he rolls over in
time to see the Knight dismount and start for him.
THE KNIGHT
Leans down next to Conor, his metal face nearly against the
boy's.  His voice slithers out of the iron in almost a whisper."|unknown
34|KNIGHT|There can be but one.|speech
35||"A CLANSMAN
Charges out of the fog and attacks the Knight, who cuts him
nearly in half.  ANOTHER wanders in and meets the same fate.
The battle is shifting to where they are.
Not finished yet with Conor, the Knight is finding himself
forced into retreat from an ever increasing number of assail-
ants.
A VASSAL
Sees his men being hacked apart trying to stop the now-mounted
Knight."|unknown
36|VASSAL #1|Leave him!|speech
37||"The clansmen obey.
With the slap of an armored gauntlet against his steed, the
Knight disappears into the fog.
The Vassal surveys the carnage before him.  His eyes fall a
moment on the moaning, gurgling Conor.
The Vassal turns and leaves the boy for dead.
9  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                                9
A patrol car pauses at the mouth of the alley.
The figure considers his situation, then quickly shoves his
sword into a near-by drain.  He straightens up and waits.
AN OFFICER
Steps out of his unit and cautiously walks forward.  His PARTNER
switches on the patrol car's side lamps, bathing the alley
in a harsh glare.
MAN IN ALLEY
For the first time we can see his face.  RICHARD TAUPIN, clad
in a well-cut business suit, looks exactly like Conor.
The police officer, upon seeing the body, grabs instinctively
for his pistol.  He yells to his partner now coming into the
alley."|unknown
