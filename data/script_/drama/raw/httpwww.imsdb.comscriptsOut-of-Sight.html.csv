We hear TRAFFIC, some STREET NOISES, then...
FADE IN: A MIAMI STREET - DAY
The financial district.  Lots of people in suits.  A shaky,
spasmodic ZOOM IN finds...
JACK FOLEY -- forty, big, focused expression -- as he rips a
tie from around his neck and throws it down in the gutter.  He
starts across the street, now peeling off his suitcoat and
dropping that, too, right there on the asphalt as we then...
WHIP PAN OVER TO REVEAL: A BANK ACROSS THE STREET
As Foley goes inside, we then...

INSIDE THE BANK
as Foley stands at a counter holding the above CREDIT APPLICATION
while he studies the bank layout.
Foley watches a MAN IN A SUIT, carrying an attache-case, enter
the bank and move through the gate into the fenced-off business
area at the front.  An EXECUTIVE rises from his desk, shakes
hands with the man and they both sit down.
Foley rosses the brochure in the trash, then crosses to a teller
window where a nameplate on the counter tells us the young woman
with the pile of dark hair smiling at him is LORETTA."|stage direction

my partner and he'll shoot your Mr.
Guindon between the eyes."|speech

13|FOLEY (CONT'D)|"Now take one of those big envelopes
and put as many hundreds, fifties and
twenties as you can pack into it.
Nothing with bank straps or rubber
bands.  I don't want any dye packs.  I
don't want any bait money.  Start with
the second drawer and then the one
over there, under the computer.  Come
on, Loretta, the key's right there
next to you.  No bills off the bottom

some trouble fitting all the bills into the envelope."|stage direction

'em in my pocket.  Okay, I haven't had
to give my partner a sign; that's good.
Now, he's gonna wait thirty seconds
till after I'm out the door, make sure
you haven't set off the alarm.  If you
have, he's gonna shoot Mr. Guindon
between the eyes.  Okay?  I think
that'll do it.  Thank you, Loretta,
and have a nice day."|speech

Foley is the oldest player here.  He's getting tired, starts to
lose his breath.  He finally walks off the court, breathing so
hard he can't even talk.  He simply motions to SOME YOUNG CONVICT
to come in and take his place.
Foley sits down on a bench, tries to catch his breath.  He looks
across the yard to where...
A GROUP OF ELDERLY INMATES
sitting around a wooden picnic table are playing cards.  All of
them are over sixty.  One of them, a one-legged guy on crutches
hops away from the table, spits out some tobacco as we...
INTERCUT THE OLD TIMERS WITH FOLEY WATCHING THEM:
As we see one old guy is making a picture frame out of old Pal
Mal and Lucky Strike packs.  Another tends to a tomato bush in
a tiny patch of garden near the wall.  Another one sits nearby
painting a picture of a man and a boy fishing from a rowboat.
Foley is about to get up off the bench when something catches
his eye.  He watches as...
TWO LATINO MEN
both little guys, jog past the game, slow to a walk, then stop
and begin stretching out.  One of them nods to Foley.  Foley
nods back, waits for the Latin guys to walk off, then walks
over to a guard, PUPKO (""PUP""), heavy-set, dumb as dirt."|stage direction

of white T-shirts until he sees the two little Latins sitting
at a table full of other little Latins.  CHINO -- fifties, in
shape -- shovels macaroni in his mouth.
Chino's ""wife"", LULU, nineteen, looks up from his own neat tray
of macaroni and jello and watches Foley walk past and sit down
with a bunch of bikers.
Foley watches as the guy across from Chino scrapes some macaroni
off his plate and on to Chino's and Chino wolfs that down, too."|stage direction

69|CHINO|Why you think is today?|speech
70|FOLEY|"You were out running this morning,
sticking to your routine, anybody
happened to notice.  But you only did
a couple of miles instead of your usual
five.  Saving yourself for the main
event.  Then I see you inside eating
ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates
for endurance."|speech

72|CHINO|"You want, I tole you you can come.
You all right, Foley.  I like you."|speech
73|FOLEY|"You told me I can come 'cause I caught
you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you

76||Chino looks towards the fence along the front of the yard.|stage direction
77|CHINO|"You see what they doing, those posts
out there?  Putting up another fence,
five metres on the other side of the

Bowl Sunday, they could have the second
fence built and we have to dig another
nine, ten days.  So we going soon as
it's dark.  You want -- I mean it --
