atomized ether.
There is WHISPERING.   And tangled VOICES.
DRIFT IN PAST prison cells the size of closets. Brief
flashes of carved faces, insanity -- COMING TO REST ON the --
FINAL CELL
A gaunt PRISONER kneels on the granite, head bowed to a
wall hung tapestry of Christ. But he's not just praying.
He's digging. With his arm under the tapestry, he
scratches at the stone with a SPOON. After only a year,
the spoon finally breaks through."|stage direction

15||"CONTINUED:
He looks to the far wall, sees a hint of light above
through the crumbling limestone. A way out. Too high to
reach, Prisoner pulls an old CHEST out of a cobwebbed
corner and slides it under the light.
He steps up onto the chest, grabs the edges of the hole
and starts to shove off when the top of the chest gives
way and his foot crunches through.
Prisoner reaches down to free his foot when he sees
something inside -- wrapped in a red cloth. He pulls it
out and as he unwraps it, he discovers the cloth is a
Nazi flag.
At the center is a crudely-shaped IRON RELIC. Eight inches
long. Stains on the edges. Could be the petrified tooth of
some prehistoric animal. Or maybe an ancient arrowhead.
As he holds it, feverish sweat starts to form on his face.
MYSTERIOUS POV
From BEHIND. As if he's being watched by someone else.
Prisoner spins, looks back AT us. Nothing.

Headlights wash over him and TIRES SCREECH. Prisoner
spins, is right in the path of a car.
BRAKES SQUEAL -- car locks up but too late -- IMPACTS
Prisoner who is violently thrown and lands in a heap.
CAR slides to a stop. DRIVER jumps out, sees the front
end sheet metal has accordioned all the way to the tires.
He scans the area for a body, spots the Prisoner and is
stunned to see him getting to his feet. Uninjured.
Prisoner is just as amazed. He glances at the RELIC in
his hand, notes the wrist has reddened and an odd SYMBOL
has appeared as if embossed in the flesh.

John walks past the panic-stricken MOTHER without a
glance, sets his cigarette on the nightstand, the glowing

through the fire escape railing, drapes it back through
the window and loops it over the ceiling fan.
He climbs onto the bed, leans over the child whose eyes
have closed and she's shaking badly. Her body seems to
be going into shock. Isn't strong enough for this.

A shadowy FIGURE several floors up stares over the rail

veneer.
This is BALTHAZAR and he definitely does not rent here.
