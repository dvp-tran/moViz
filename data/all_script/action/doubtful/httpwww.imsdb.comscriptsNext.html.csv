Thirty feet square. CRIS JOHNSON, wearing a jail uniform,
sits in a HEAVY CHAIR that is bolted to the floor. Mid-
twenties, jaded, rebellious, handsome as a statue, Cris
radiates a serene, if somewhat scruffy, charisma.
He faces a PLASMA SCREEN MONITOR on a bare wall. To the left
of the screen, an unframed MIRROR; to the right, a DIGITAL
CLOCK-CALENDAR.
A WOMAN'S FACE appears on the plasma screen. CALLIE FERRIS.

Mirror
Cris ages before his own eyes. Wrinkles etch into skin. Hair
greys, recedes. Outrage ebbs into hollow resignation as Cris
watches himself waste away."|stage direction

Cris strides crisply through the casino. Sees another PAIR OF
BLACK SUITS, scanning for him. He ducks into the maze of

random. A moment after each turn, a Black Suit appears ahead,
behind, or to the side - where they would have spotted Cris.

Cris studies the gamblers playing the machines nearby, then
heads to a particular spot - where he is sure to be spotted -
except that a TEXAS-SIZED MAN repositions himself, blocking
the Black Suit's view.
The Black Suit moves on. Cris shifts to another spot just as
a different Black Suit arrives at the other end of the aisle.

Passing a room service cart, he rolls it in front of him. A
few steps on, he takes the bottle of OLIVE OIL on the cart
and pours some in front of one random closed door. Cris then
shoves the room service cart down the hall toward an empty
intersecting corridor. A Black Suit barrels into the empty
intersection just as the cart arrives - and tumbles over it.
Behind Cris, a door swings open; a Black Suit charges out;
steps precisely into the puddle of poured olive oil - and
falls on his ass.
Cris slips by him, but gets cut off by an arriving group of
FOUR MORE BLACK SUITS. Big guys. They try to grab him. He
evades their grasp almost magically and, like a Shaolin Monk,
somehow leverages them into each other until they are in a
pile on the floor. Cris darts around them into the...
Lobby
He co-opts a luggage cart that is loaded up for delivery.
Rolling it to the left, a Black Suit on that side doesn't see
him - and moves on. Cris switches to the right side of the
card - just as a second Black Suit would have seen him.
Abandoning the cart, Cris sets off across the lobby in a
herky-jerky rhythm.
He walks four quick steps without being seen. Then stops
behind a column just as Black Suit 1 turns his way. When
Black Suit 1 looks on, Cris resumes his journey, cutting
across the lobby at an acute angle. In this way, he avoids
being seen by Black Suit 2. Cris now backs up three steps and
avoids being seen by Black Suit 3.
By precisely choosing his movements and knowing where his
hunters will be looking, Cris achieves something like
invisibility.
The last obstacle to daylight is Ferris. She sees him. He
makes a run for the door. She dashes after him."|stage direction
