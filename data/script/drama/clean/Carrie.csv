This is the home of MARGARET WHITE and her daughter CARRIE. It seems
to have been scrubbed from roof to porch; it is white. Even the lawn seems to
have been washed and bleached. Antiseptic.

white bikini running interference between her skin and the sun.
The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OVER the expanse of her body ­ luxuriant, taking it in
inch for inch as she dreamily rubs in suntan lotion and licks her lips. The MUSIC is coming
from a transistor radio by her side; she's on a beach blanket in the Horan back yard."|stage direction||

11||4. STELLA'S POV ­ CARRIE WHITE|location||
12||"A terribly appealing little girl, a child of indeterminable age. Pink cheeks, a halo of blonde-
white hair which will darken in time. What sets her apart from other children, however, are a
pair of bright button brown eyes; and it's these eyes that we notice as she peers at Stella
through the hedge.
STELLA
Hiya, Carrie. Gee you gave me a fright.
(turning down the radio)
How long have you been there?
CARRIE
(not smiling; pointing with her finger)
What are those?
Stella looks where Carrie is pointing; the top of her bikini has slipped, just barely revealing
her breasts ­ white against the golden tan. Stella adjusts her suit ­ not out of any particular
modesty of her own but as a reflex at being stared at so strangely.
STELLA
Those are my breasts, honey.
CARRIE
(a beat; then solemnly)
I wish I had some.
STELLA
You will. `Course you'll have to wait a
couple of years, but ­
CARRIE
(a fact)
No I won't.
STELLA
Why, sure you will.
CARRIE
(emphatic)
No, I won't.
(glancing behind her)
Momma says no... Momma says good girls don't.

STELLA
(at something of a loss)
Well, I'm a good girl. And besides, doesn't your mother have breasts?"|unknown||
13||5    CARRIE|location||
14||"Glances anxiously at the mention of her mother at the White house next door.
She swallows her words so that all Stella and we hear is:
CARRIE
...dirtypillows.
STELLA
What?
CARRIE
Momma calls them dirtypillows. Says she's got them
`cuz she was bad when she made me."|unknown||
15||6   STELLA|location||
16||"Incredulous. But she senses that Carrie is both perfectly serious and quite worried, and she
too glances warily over at the White house just beyond the half-grown hedge.
She kneels next to Carrie and tries to laugh it off.
STELLA
Now, honey, that's just silly. Listen ­ you must be real
hot in that long dress. What do you say we go inside and
get us some lemonade, would you like that?"|unknown||
17||7   CARRIE|location||
18||"Clearly torn ­ tempted but in the clutch of some weird terror ­ as if she expected the
earth to open and swallow her up. She shakes her head.
STELLA
C'mon.
(offering her hand)
It'll be our secret.
Carrie ­ now really scared ­ shakes her head and disappears farther into the hedge.

CARRIE
I can't!
STELLA
Sure you can. I make it nice and sweet, and ­
And just at that moment, a figure appears in the second-story window in the White house.
Although Stella and we really can't distinctly see through the sun's glare, it's unmistakably
MARGARET WHITE. The moment this big woman sees her daughter with Stella, she lets
out a bloodcurdling scream:
MARGARET
CAARRIEETTAAA!!!

20||"9 STELLA'S POV ­ CLOSER ON CARRIE
As she sucks in her breath, quivering with fright, looking as if she might faints. She looks
quickly to Stella, then back at the White house, then back to Stella. For the merest flash, she
seems to smile ­ or is she about to cry?
And then, she's gone ­ running around the hedge and then up the porch stairs and into the
White house as fast her legs can carry her."|unknown||
21||10. STELLA|location||
22||"Stands there, riveted. Not knowing what's happened, what to do. It's utterly silent for a
moment.
And then, an incredible CACOPHONY of strange sounds starts coming from the White
house ­ an unearthly babble as Margaret White screams, rants, and screeches; as Carrie sobs
that she's sorry, that she forgot.
STELLA
Mother!
(louder)
Mother!

to answer to her daughter's call.
MRS. HORAN
What in the name of God? What's the matter?
STELLA

I don't know... Carrie was just talking to me,
and Mrs. White started screaming and..."|unknown||
25||12. THE WHITE HOUSE|location||
26||"The sun glistening brilliantly on it as in the opening shot. Again, it should appear like a huge
glass globe over which we counterpoint one mother/daughter dialogue with the less distinct
babble of another:
MARGARET (v.o.)
I told you to stay away from there, I told you....
CARRIE (v.o.)
I'm sorry, Momma.
MARGARET (v.o.)
...to stay away from that girl, that whore...
CARRIE (v.o.)
Please, Momma!
MARGARET (v.o.)
... of Babylon!
Which continues over:"|unknown||
27||13. TWO SHOT ­ STELLA AND MRS. HORAN|location||
28||"Their eyes riveted on the house ­ trying, squinting to see through the sun's terrible glare.
STELLA
Don't you yell at her like that! Stop that!
MRS. HORAN
That poor sweet child...

STELLA
Mother, we've got to do something!
MRS. HORAN
What?
STELLA
Call the police? Mother, call the police!
MRS. HORAN
(not about to interfere; hopeless)
The child...
At this point, the hysteric babble reaches its crescendo; we should be able to pick out phrases
in this cacophony as Margaret rants at Carrie to go into her closet and pray for forgiveness;
as Carrie's frightened little voice proclaims that she forgot, that she's sorry. And then
suddenly the screaming stops and it's quiet ­ dead quiet."|unknown||

appears to be a stone the size of a small pebble lands on the roof.

like miniature bombs.
Stones from a perfectly blue summer day.
Stones ranging in size from marbles to handballs.
One of them hits a downspout, knocking it onto the lawn. CRASHING, CRACKING
SOUNDS as these pieces of granite tear into the stucco roofing, leaving holes.
The effect is that of a drum being bombarded.

SOUND of larger and larger stones as they pelt the house and we hear Margaret throughout
screaming:
MARGARET'S VOICE
Stop that! Stop that!
Stella is clutching Mrs. Horan like a child terrified by the freakiest of summer storms ­ a
healthy young woman as her figure in the bikini testifies, but a child nonetheless, this
nightmarish moment."|unknown||

once again into an incredible, silently blazing white.
MAIN TITLES."|unknown||
43||21 EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE ­ MORNING|location||
44||"Now some years later ­ and no longer glistening so whitely or mysteriously. We see the
front of the house as the door flies open. Carrie, now sixteen or seventeen, appears in the
doorway, carrying school books. As she comes out on the porch, the screen door bangs
behind her.

She is wearing a shapeless, drab dress ­ much too long, not so much out of style as utterly
without style. What remains in this adolescent girl that links her with the pretty child we
glimpsed in the prologue are those remarkable eyes.
As she comes down the porch stairs, we hear:
MARGARET'S VOICE
Carrie!
Carrie stops, turns to reply into the house.
CARRIE
Yes, Momma.
MARGARET'S VOICE
You come straight home from school.
A moment of hesitation on Carrie's part, a very slight hint of rebellion, but:
CARRIE
(sweetly)
I always do, Momma.
Then she turns, walks to the street, gathering pace, quickening."|unknown||

one does. It's a vacant lot with a FOR SALE sign out front, with overgrown weeds. From
the looks of them, the house vanished a long time ago."|unknown||

house, the livelier she seems. We sense that underneath this drab dress is a girl pushing out,
an altogether different creature than her appearance would suggest. And to help persuade us
about this possibility, there is MUSIC."|unknown||

RHONDA WILSON (sisters although not identical twins), CHRIS HARGENSEN and SUE
SNELL. Supervising the game is MISS COLLINS wearing a warm-up suit and holding a
whistle awaiting the next point. Among the girls is CARRIE anxiously watching for the ball
to come her way. It has apparently been a close game, the competition building steadily.
When the shot begins, Miss Collins has just blown her whistle to announce:
COLLINS
Okay, now. This is game point.
This is the final point of the game and Rhonda Wilson is serving (she is on the opposite team
as Carrie).

Twenty ­ Twenty.
The ball is successfully served and remains in play for some time as the girls skillfully volley
it back and forth over the net. And then, just when the tension is its greatest, the ball comes
over the net toward Carrie. It's evident that the outcome of the game depends upon her
success. The little boy who decided to put his finger in the dyke had it easier.
The other girls are (AD LIB) shouting cautions and admonitions to Carrie. Carrie almost
trembles with tension, about to bat the ball over the net, afraid to hit it.
Carrie whacks the ball. She shacks it hard. And on a line ­ straight into the net.

toweling, spraying deodorant, bras hooked, underpants stepped into. Steam hangs in the air.
So do words, running into one another, tumbling, drifting.

different girl, which pleases her. She looks different, very different, from before. She's
dressed in her lush red crushed velvet prom dress, but the SHOT is ANGLED in such a way
that we don't see it. In any case, it is not prim. She is wearing some makeup. She looks...
well, there has been a transformation.

scene ­ and all that follow for a considerable period of time ­ has an edge of unreality to it.
It's all been diffused a bit ­ a fairy tale through Carrie's eyes. What would look bad or tacky

TOMMY
Hey, it won't be so bad."|unknown||

like they stepped out of an advertisement for happiness.
Carrie just stands at the double-doors which are the main entrance to the gym, taking it all in

GEORGE
Ross, if I'd known you were going to look this good, I'd have
asked you instead of Frieda.
The two boys immediately go into a mock fight. Frieda comes up to Carrie.
FRIEDA
Don't let it bother you. If they destroy each other, I'll dance with you.
Carrie smiles back at her nervously; there's an awkward silence."|unknown||
988||"Hey, where'd you buy your dress? I love it.
CARRIE
(shyly)
I made it.
FRIEDA
(unaffected surprise)
Made it? No shit.
Carrie hesitates; realizes Frieda is quite sincere.
CARRIE
No shit.
Frieda laughs; so does Carrie, and the tension eases up. Behind them, Tommy keeps one eye
on Carrie. He shrugs ­ it's working, goddammit ­ and he stuffs his hands into his dinner
jacket."|unknown||

You're positively glowing. What's your secret?

It's very... nice.
