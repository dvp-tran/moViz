3||"The CAMERA TRACKS slowly through clouds of moving dust. Shafts
of muted light pierce the dense atmosphere. An eerie
netherworld envelops us. Strange ghostly forms appear and
disappear in the distance. They seem like apparitions.
Broken timbers and dangling cables emerge from the smoky
light. We see hints of a huge demolished space.
An old white plaster wall FILLS THE SCREEN. Momentary blips
of light flash across it. SOUNDS of street traffic are heard
dimly in the distance.
With startling impact, the SOUND of a sledgehammer explodes
out of nowhere. The wall shudders.
HAMMER BLOWS assault the audience. They are loud and jarring.
The wall buckles.
Chunks of plaster CRASH to the floor. The air fills with new
swirls of white dust. The SLEDGEHAMMER smashes INTO VIEW.
Beams of sunlight cut through the cracks, piercing the
atmosphere like searchlights in a fog. A huge section of
wall falls toward camera as more plaster billows into the
air. We hear voices talking."|stage direction

The CAMERA MOVES IN and for the first time we see them. MOLLY
JENSEN, in her late 20's, has a bandanna around her hair and
a workman's mask over her nose, but we can tell from her
eyes and cheekbones that she is beautiful. SAM WHEAT, in his
late 30's, is also hidden behind a mask, but he has a strong
forehead and handsome features. Sweat is dripping down his
brow, leaving streaks in the dust. CARL BRUNER, early 30's,
removes his mask revealing a good looking young man with a
fashionable two-day stubble. Both men have their shirts off."|stage direction

BLACKNESS AND A LOUD THUD. Suddenly a shaft of light
penetrates the darkness. Another thud and more light. We see
a hole. The hook of a crowbar enters it, grappling with
something around the edges. Then, with a tug and a loud yank,
a huge section of tin ceiling crashes to the floor. Huge
clouds of dust fly into the air. Molly looks up, astonished."|stage direction

feet up there."|speech

is so unexpected and ferocious that Sam has no sense of how

hold of him and slams him into the subway door. Sam's head
plows right through it.

a violent force. Carl's body careens into walls and
floorboards. Wiring snaps. Two-by-fours crack.
Carl, crawling desperately to escape, sees his gun on the

door. The lock explodes and the door flies open.
Carl tries to run for it, but Sam cuts in front of him. With
growing power, Sam sends Carl flying back into the apartment,
colliding into a tall scaffold. Bags of plaster topple to
the ground as mounds of plaster dust hurl into the air. The
apartment looks like a scene from another world.
Carl, in a state of total unrelieved panic, breaks away from
Sam. The dust obscures his escape. Like a trapped insect, he
scrambles furiously to the fire escape window. Sam cannot

Carl shoves at the window. It is stuck. With a supreme effort,
he grabs a ripped bag of plaster and swings it at the glass.
Half of its plaster spews across the room before smashing
the window. Shards of glass fly in all directions. Sam turns
and sees Carl. He surges after him, but knows he cannot get

Carl is halfway out the window when Sam's fist slams into an
electrical box attached to a dangling BX cable. It goes flying
toward the window. To his amazement, it hits the frame. A
huge pane of glass dislodges and comes crashing down. Carl
looks up just in time to see the pointed edge aiming for his
chest. Before he can move, it pierces him between the ribs
and slices into his heart. His body quivers.
Carl's eyes bulge from their sockets. His body begins to
spasm. He can't get up. A look of abject terror flashes
through his eyes. He tries to scream. There is no sound. He
tries to breathe. There is no breath.

With one last effort, Carl lurches forward. To his amazement,
his body stands up and pulls away from the window. He looks
