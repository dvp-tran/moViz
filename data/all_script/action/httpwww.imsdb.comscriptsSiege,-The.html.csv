6||"A SATELLITE VIEW
Of the same scene. A grainy IMAGE of the car, and some
distance away, a moving cluster of animals. They are:
HERD OF SHEEP
As seen at ground level. Two SHEPHERDS goad them forward. In
the distance, the MERCEDES approaches.

world, to bring these people to
justice."""|speech
14||"BACK TO -- THE COAST ROAD
Inside the Mercedes, they watch as the Shepherd urinates and
the sheep mill about in the middle of the road. The driver
rolls down his window to scream in Arabic at:
THE POOR SHEPHERD
Who hurries to button his fly. It is only as we look closer
that we see the silenced muzzle of:
COLT COMMANDO RIFLE
Protruding from the sleeve of his jhallabah. And then:
THE HERD OF SHEEP
Fill the frame, blocking our view of the Mercedes, and for a
moment, all we can HEAR is their gentle bleating. But as
they clear frame, we can see that:
THE MERCEDES
Has been turned into an abattoir, its windshield shattered
and bloody. The driver slumps over the steering wheel, the
bodyguard is half out of the window. And in the distance:
WITH A MAGICIAN'S ALACRITY
One Shepherd pulls a BLACK HOOD over the Sheik's head while
the other injects him with a HYPODERMIC. The first Shepherd
activates a SATCHEL CHARGE and swings it into the Mercedes
while the second straps the Sheik into a HARNESS... A BALLOON
self-inflates and hurtles aloft, pulling a cable attached to
the Sheik's harness.
AN MC-130 COMBAT TALON AIRCRAFT
Its ""Whiskers"" in the nose of the aircraft snag the cable
without slowing and roars off, the Sheik dangling unconscious
beneath -- just as the satchel charges EXPLODE the Mercedes.
THE SATELLITE VIEW
Records impassively for a moment, then breaks up into static."|stage direction
15|DEVEREAUX|Gotcha.|speech
16||"IN A SAFE HOUSE -- SOMETIME LATER
A pale, diminished Sheik sits at a steelcase table. A STEEL
COT and a STEEL TOILET. Closed-circuit cameras in the corner.
Opposite him: the man, whose voice we have only heard: GENERAL
WILLIAM DEVEREAUX -- and though he wears a civilian suit,
his bearing betrays his pedigree. His considerable charm and
habitual skepticism are as much a product of self-discipline
as his close-order drill."|stage direction
17|DEVEREAUX|"Nobody knows you're here. Not your
people. Not even my President. You'll
die here alone and be buried unknown --
barring some miracle."|speech
