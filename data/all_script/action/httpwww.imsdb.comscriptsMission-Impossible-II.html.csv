opens the satchel and pokes thru a few toilet articles, personal

plastic container marked 'S.G.' - a small, square shiny object,
hi-tech and at odds with the other items.  She pulls out an urn-

69|VOICE|Terrain, terrain.  Pull up, pull up.|speech
70||"The co-pilot stirs.  He blearily rouses himself just in time to
see:
A mountain rushing toward him.  As mountain meets airplane, the
frame is filled with fire, but when camera pulls back from the
fireball, it is in fact no more than a match head filling frame,
which ignited, lights a fuse..
The MI theme music kicks in, the main credits roll to:
EXT - FACE OF MOUNTAIN (DAY)
For a moment it might be thought part of the same range when the
plane crashed but when Ethan Hunt climbs into frame the angle
widen and titles down, revealing more of where he's come from
than where he's going.  Aside from the fact that he's in the
midst of free-climbing what is easily a sheer rock face of at
least a thousand feet, there's the sunny picture-postcard view of
a lovely valley and pellucid lake thousands of feet below.  Ethan
climbs out of shot.
WIDE UP ANGLE (DAY)
revealing the summit, a light breeze hitting the lichen and
whatever growth has a slender purchase on the rocky mountainside,
fluffy clouds overhead.
Ethan into shot.  Despite the spectacularly precarious handholds
he's using to hang onto the mountain and his life, he appears
relaxed, engaged - for him - in the equivalent of busman's
holiday.  It's leisurely danger for Ethan; one might almost
expect to hear Julie Andrews trilling 'Climb Every Mountain' on
the soundtrack.
Then a rock he's been grasping crumbles and Ethan drops about six
inches before he grabs onto the mountain again.  As he hangs by
five fingers thousands of feet above the earth he doesn't seem
terribly concerned until he spots a helicopter.
It's materialized behind the summit and passes surprisingly close
just overhead, casting its shadow downward over Ethan.
Instinctively, Ethan flattens himself against the rock surface,
as if the copter poses some sort of threat to him.  But when
its rotors whir it into the distance Ethan relaxes and resumes his
climb.
A HAIRY OVERHANG (EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY)
near the summit Ethan departing from the vertical and is now
traversing the mountain with more of his back than his feet
exposed to the earth far below.  He's clinging to the mountain
almost like a fly walking on the ceiling.  When he reaches for a
handhold that will restore him to the vertical, he dislodges a
lizard - and manages to catch it before it plunges thousand of
feet to oblivion."|stage direction
71|ETHAN|Whoaa..|speech
72||"He pockets the lizard, climbs the overhang.
REVERSE ANGLE - SUMMIT
with Ethan's hand, then Ethan coming into view and making the
summit.  He reaches into his pocket and releases the lizard who
favors Ethan with a stern reptilian stare by way of gratitude.  To
lizard:"|stage direction
73|ETHAN|You're welcome.|speech
74||"The lizard scampers off, then a low beeping sound at his back
attracts his attention.  He turns to see the source of the
beeping, a small package in day-glo colors with a day-glo
streamer.  Ethan looks to the sky where the helicopter is now
ominously circling back.
Ethan lifts the day-glo package and waves it in the direction of
the copter.  With a distinct lack of enthusiasm.
The helicopter once again turns, banks and disappears.  Ethan has
opened the beeping package and finds a pair of sunglasses.

89||"Ethan, with a fair amount of disgust, gets to his feet and jumps
off the mountain, in, what for a moment looks like a suicidal
snit.  Then, somewhere hundreds of feet below camera, there's a
little puff of color as the tulip-shaped chute pops out of his
back-pack.  Begin the sound of a castanets and the animal-like cries
of flamenco dancers."|stage direction

91||"EXT - ANDALUSIAN VILLA (EVE)
Bustling in the activity of a large private party, with arriving
guests and attentive valets, as a young woman, her face unseen,
exits her car and enters the villa.
A FLASH OF SKIRT AND LACE (INT-EXT. VILLA - FLAMENCO DANCERS - EVE)
where to the cries of dancers add graceful feminine hands
wielding the castanets.  The dancers perform on a raised platform
and NYAH NORDOFF-HALL'S face can be glimpsed thru the swirling
skirts and pounding heels, looking thru, not at them.
REVERSE ANGLE - ETHAN
looking back in a similar way to Nyah; surreal lighting and the
relentless chorus of pounding heels seem to isolate them in the
crowed party.  Nyah continues to look at Ethan over the shoulder
over her wanna-be escort, a very attentive gentleman.  Nyah
offers up her empty glass, and the gentleman eagerly takes it to
the bar for a refill, leaving Nyah and Ethan looking at one
another.  Ethan approaches her."|stage direction
92|ETHAN|Do you know me?|speech

98|ETHAN|"There's not enough time in the world for
any of it to be bad."|speech

to nose.  Whispered but breezy:"|stage direction

don't mind telling you it's not an easy
choice."|speech
101|ETHAN|What if I pay the rent?|speech

next time we meet - I'll pay your rent."|speech
106||(kissing him, sweetly)|location
107|NYAH|Now bugger off.|speech
108||"And purposeful creature that she is, she takes her frustrated
desire upstairs, timing her footsteps so as to use the sound of
the dancer's steps to cover her own.  Once upstairs, a security
guard near the master bedroom can be seen eagerly following her
down the hall, both moving past a pair of windows, visible to
Ethan.  In a few moments, Nyah can be seen past the
windows in the opposite direction, without the guard following.
In another moment or two, a very puzzled looking security guard
can be glimpsed in the first window, looking up and down the
hall, clearly having lost sight of Nyah.  Ethan smiles, moves out
of shot.
INT - MASTER BEDROOM (EVE)
Nyah has opened the door and moves swiftly thru the bedroom.
INT - BATH (EVE)
A decadent looking affair with suggestive lighting, mirrored
walls.  The tub has a tray across it which includes a wine cooler
chilling a bottle of Crystal and a mound of caviar on a bed of
ice.  Nyah can't resist.  She spoons a dollop of the caviar and
downs it before she moves along the frescoed walls of the tub to
its back.  There, she pulls out her compact and removes the puff,
revealing an electronic density meter.  She turns it on and holds
it at the rear of the tub.  Its sweep gauge jumps sharply from
green thru yellow and into red."|stage direction
109||(her fondest hopes confirmed)|location
110|NYAH|Mmmm.|speech
111||"She now steps into the tub and focuses on the grout between the
tiles just above the sop dish.  Her knee eyes search for any
cracks in the grout and she spots one.  Using a tweezers she
pulls the silver of the grout out from between the tiles, revealing
something that looks like a credit card wedged between the tiles.
She slips the card into a narrow opening under the sop dish.
There's the sound of hydraulics and two arms move the marble
casing out from the rear of the tub.  Nyah breathes a sigh of
relief and anticipation: kneeling in the tub she finds herself
looking down at an open safe, revealing some half-dozen locked
compartments.  As she studies them:"|stage direction
112|ETHAN|Decisions, decisions.|speech
113||"Nyah looks up to see Ethan's reflection in the bathroom
mirrors, looking down at her kneeling in the tub."|stage direction
114|NYAH|What are you doing here?|speech
115|ETHAN|"Think you're the only one who can pick a
lock?"|speech
116||(not altogether pleased)|location
117|NYAH|I see.  You're not just another pretty face..|speech
118||"Before Ethan can answer, a voice can be heard coming from the
bedroom warbling Granada in Spanish, and with considerable gusto."|stage direction
119|NYAH (cont'd)|Oh god.  A bloody baritone.|speech
120||"Nyah catches a reflection behind Ethan's in the bathroom mirror.
She reaches up and grabs Ethan by the lapel, yanking him into the
tub, pulling him down on top of her.  Once again they're nose to
nose."|stage direction
121|ETHAN|I take it you prefer tenors.|speech
122||"She glances up at the mirror.  In it is the reflection of SENOR
AUGUSTO DE L'ARENA, a big amiable Castilian in his fifties who's
changing a white dinner jacket that's had wine split on it.  He
breaks into a heavily accented version of 'Now or Never', and
disappears from the dressing room mirror."|stage direction
123|NYAH|Would you mind if I'm on top?|speech
124|ETHAN|Oh, either way works for me.|speech
125||"With a jaundiced look she rolls over on top of Ethan and begins
working on one of the safe compartments, using a tiny torque
wrench from a tube of lipstick and a carbide pick from a mascara
brush.  She glances down and is rather disconcerted.  Continues
working with the pick and wrench."|stage direction
126|ETHAN'S VOICE|You're never gonna find it there.|speech
127||(she jumps, dropping the torque wrench)|location
128|NYAH|Damn it!  Find what?|speech
129|ETHAN|"His ex-wife's Bulgari necklace that goes
up for auction Tuesday."|speech
130||"Looking down to Ethan, a touch of indignation:
LOOKING UP
more or less, hands locked behind his neck as he rests against
the raked back of the tub, his eyes and nose inches from Nyah's
lower pelvic region as she straddles him.  Not exactly in the mood
to move:
She stiffens - he knows too damn much."|stage direction
131|NYAH|- right..where is it?|speech
132|ETHAN|Far right.|speech
133||"She immediately switches her efforts from top left to the
bottom right compartment.  She's utterly nonplussed:"|stage direction

139|NYAH|- right..|speech
140||"She unstraddles him and, with a few deft moves with the torque
wrench and carbide pick - and it's open.  She withdraws a velvet
pouch and opens the pouch.  Out spills the spectacular necklace."|stage direction

work on the safe before they triggered the
alarm, isn't that right Miss Hall?"|speech

should yes."|speech

intensified curiosity - about Ethan."|stage direction

recommend re-setting the senors to
respond to a lighter load.  How do you
feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?"|speech

to disrupt your party any longer.  we have
some further concerns about the disposition

receive in our written report by fax in the
morning, hard copy to follow.  Shall we?"|speech

pursuit progressively more determined.  They are reaching the
limits of adhesion around blind curves.
MORE SHOTS DRIVING (DAWN)
The sky's battleship gray; Ethan pursues Nyah around hairpin
turns high above the Costa del Sol; they rip thru patches of
marine fog drifting on the road, obscuring it.
Both are appalled by the other's willingness to escalate risk in
this game of flight and pursuit until Ethan tears thru a fogbank
and sees on his GPS what Nyah can't see thru the fog -
less than four hundred meters ahead is a turn she can't possibly
negotiate and if she can't she'll plunge off the road hundreds of

Ethan's back."|stage direction
1294|AMBROSE|Hunt.  You should have killed me.|speech
1295||"Near Hunt's feet is his own gun, obscured from Ambrose's view by
dust from the copter.  Ethan tosses the canister to Luther and
then kicks his gun up out of the dirt and into the air.  He
catches it, drops down and fires, killing Ambrose.
EXT/ INT - HELICOPTER ON CLIFFTOP
Ethan reaches Nyah at the copter.  Inches apart, they can only
stare silently at one another.
INT - CULTURAL MUSEUM
Didgeridoo music.  A child admires a painting.  Swanbeck and Ethan
face one another.  A long, long pause.  For a moment it appears as
if Swanbeck has lost awareness of Ethan's presence."|stage direction
1296|SWANBECK|"Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to
begin.  Any suggestions?"|speech
1297|ETHAN|"You'd like me to conduct my own
debriefing."|speech
1298|SWANBECK|"Why not?  You've done just about
everything else on this operation."|speech
1299|ETHAN|"I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was
a compliment."|speech
1300|SWANBECK|"Of course it was.  Anyone whose operations
requires the level of disinformation that
yours do, is bound to get a little flak
here and there.  You try flogging the
stories on CNN I've had to come up with
about what's been going on around here the
last few days.  At any rate, it's been
most instructive -- what they'll swallow,
or what they'll broadcast with a straight
face."|speech

1302|SWANBECK|"Miss Hall's blood, it appears, has
absolutely no elements of the Chimera
virus.  Not even antibodies."|speech
1303|ETHAN|Yes, I gathered as much.|speech
1304|SWANBECK|"And the only other remaining sample was in
the canister you recover from Ambrose."|speech
1305|ETHAN|Yes.|speech
1306|SWANBECK|"And that appears to have been destroyed.
It also contained the anti-virus,
Bellerophon."|speech
1307|ETHAN|"Well, Bellerophon, it turns out, was only
really effective against Chimera."|speech
1308|SWANBECK|"But you were under specific instructions
to bring back a living sample of the
Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to
know how, after you'd managed its recovery
intact, it subsequently got destroyed."|speech
1309|ETHAN|By fire.  That's the best way, really.|speech
1310|SWANBECK|"So you didn't fail mission, you simply
changed it."|speech
1311||Ethan doesn't respond.|stage direction
1312|SWANBECK (cont'd)|"It's no longer enough for you to execute
and implement IMF policy, you now wish to
go in the business of creating it?"|speech
1313|ETHAN|No, I don't.  But in this case -|speech
1314|SWANBECK|"In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In
face, it was a pretty damn good idea.
Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for
Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her
criminal records will certainly be
expunged.  I'm assuming you approve."|speech
1315|ETHAN|I do.|speech
1316|SWANBECK|"Where is she now, by the way?  Do you
know?"|speech
1317|ETHAN|I don't.  No exactly.|speech
1318|SWANBECK|Well, Hunt, what are your plans?|speech
1319|ETHAN|"Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll
let you know where I'm going."|speech
1320|SWANBECK|"Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't
be a vacation if you did."|speech

1322|SKY NEWSCASTER|"This incident in the wake of rumors
suddenly surfacing about Mr. McCloy and
Biocyte's financial difficulties --
including criminal allegations of insider
trading, embezzlement, conspiracy to

understandably, sent stock prices of the

Ethan emerges to a very crowded street.  Billy and Luther are
waiting.  Both look to Ethan."|stage direction

1325|LUTHER|So what did he say?|speech
1326|ETHAN|Good job.  And thanks.|speech

1331|BILLY|"Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy
Baird's the name.  Anything you need to
get, move or watch, I'm your man."|speech

One quick bear hug, then:"|stage direction
1333|LUTHER|"Always nice hearing from you man.  Stay in
touch.."|speech
1334||"And Luther's off.  Ethan looks after him, a bit wistfully.  Then,
curiously tentative he moves off into the crowd.  After a half-
dozen steps, something catches his eyes.  He stops.
One quick bear hug, then:"|stage direction
