7|unknown|"A near-future MOTORCYCLE stops near a dramatic HIGH-RISE
RESIDENTIAL BUILDING. The rider, clad in black leather,
climbs off his machine. We'll call him the ASSASSIN.
He flips up his VISOR. His face is scarred, stubbly. He
conceals himself in an alcove, eyes never leaving the
building's entrance.
A uniformed DOORMAN opens the high-rise's lobby door for
a HANDSOME YOUNG MAN in a TUXEDO and TRENCHCOAT.
THE ASSASSIN has been waiting for this. He removes what
looks like a rifle scope from his jacket, aims it at
TUXEDO.
SCOPE POV - focusing on TUXEDO'S FACE, magnified. A
digital readout: ""SCANNING..."" Then a long SERIAL
NUMBER reads out and the name, ""LIONEL ALEXANDER CANTER,""
along with other personal information below.
THE ASSASSIN puts away the scanner scope, satisfied. He
reaches a hand into a pocket, withdraws a mysterious
DEVICE. The size of a first generation cellphone, it has
a military look, with a clear sliding panel over safety
switches and buttons.
The ASSASSIN hurries toward TUXEDO, but before he can"|speech

the back. They're gone in an instant.
The ASSASSIN, frustrated, dashes for his MOTORCYCLE. He
starts it and pursues the limousine.

TUXEDO emerges sans jacket and tie, his dress-shirt open."|speech

ARMANDO nods and pulls away. TUXEDO moves toward the
entrance, says a word into an INTERCOM with a
SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. The door opens within moments, he
disappears inside.
THE ASSASSIN parks his bike, a few steps behind. Tuxedo
has vanished through the STEEL DOOR before he can catch
up with him."|speech

pit, MEN and WOMEN. All are young, some beautiful,
others extremely decorated and pierced. They tear at
each other brutally, trying to do real damage. On the
edges of the pit, individual FISTFIGHTS go on. An
incongruous CHANDELIER overhead, gilt-edged MIRRORS on
the walls-- the FIGHTERS SLAM INTO and SHATTER them.
A HARD-CORE BAND plays on an elevated stage. The
MUSICIANS are heavily punked out, in outlandish clothes,
with pierced faces, tattoos and body make-up.
IN A VIP AREA, a balcony elevated above the stage,
numerous BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE at tables. Many are making
out, gay, straight, threesomes-- orgies happen up here.
TUXEDO sits by himself. He raises a GLASS TUBE attached
to a CORD, one of a few leading into an ELECTRONIC DEVICE
on the table. As he brings the tube close to his own
neck, an ARC of electricity jumps to his skin. His
features go slack, a shudder goes through him. Then he
lowers the tube with a smile. He's using a JACKER-- a
sort of electro-shock hookah. A SHOUT over the MUSIC:"|speech
27|BLONDE|"Mind if I join you?
A stunningly beautiful BLONDE in edgy, dramatic clothes

in law enforcement. He's smart and able, wants things to

Greer's blinded temporarily, the PSYCHO squirms away,
running from between buildings across a street--
WHAM! He's hit full-on by a SEMI, his body FLIES through
the air. He LANDS HARD on cement, but amazingly is still
alive. He tries to get up, but--
GREER plants a foot on his chest and holds him fast
against the ground. Greer, still wiping at this eyes,
points his weapon at the PSYCHO's head."|speech

this.
THE SEMI DRIVER is still behind the wheel of his rig. He
calls out to Greer:"|speech

He disconnects, reaches to turn the PSYCHO's head to one
side. The back of his skull is smashed. Instead of gore
and brains, we see torn GRAY PLASTIC and dense CIRCUITRY,
oozing pinkish hydraulic fluid at his neck.
We're in a world of SURROGATES, remotely operated
synthetic humans (also known as SYNTHs). These are not
artificially-intelligent robots-- each is linked directly
to a human being, miles or hundreds of miles away.
Surrogates are distinguishable from flesh-and-blood
humans primarily by their physical perfection-- ugly
surrogates are rare. On closer look, their eyes may have
an inhuman quality. Without a human mind sending and
receiving impulses, they are completely inert.
Suddenly the PSYCHO comes to life, spins his head around
at an impossible angle and BITES GREER'S HAND."|speech

the door as they move into the place.
It's minimalist, nothing on the walls. Empty pizza
boxes. Skirts, stockings, high-heels strewn around
haphazardly. We also glimpse a large CHARGING CRADLE,
contact points embedded in the foam inside, shaped to
accomodate a curvaceous female body."|speech

A fat, hairy arm hangs over the side of a high-tech
