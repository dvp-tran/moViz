and we watch the knob slowly turn.
Tight on a feminine arm with a tattoo that announces ""hope.""
We pull back to find that both arms are employed in the
pulling of what looks like a large suitcase.
NICOLE MAGGEN, a beautiful but tired woman, finishes pulling
the suitcase that we now surmise to be a folded-up massage
table out of the motel room. With her bra in one hand and
the rickety table resting against the wall of the exterior
2nd floor hallway of the motel, she assesses her situation.
She digs in her purse, lights a cigarette and continues
digging in her purse. She finds a beat-up candy tin. She
opens it and quickly sorts through a collection of burnt
foils, heroin foils, looking for residue. Nothing.
She now finds and holds up the 100 bucks she just made. She
flips open her cheap phone and makes a call...she thinks
better of it and hangs up."|stage direction

radio personalities spewing nonsensical patter...
An attractive YOUNG WOMAN wrestles free of the covers and
gets out of bed. She crosses naked through the room as a
cell phone starts ringing.
Back to the bed as WHIP WHITAKER rises into frame and
inhabits the room like a lazy ape at the zoo. WHIP wears his
40 some years of life experience like a medal. Smoke hangs
in the air and empty beers, a pint of vodka and two empty
carafes of cheap hotel wine clutter the table as WHIP
snatches up his phone and answers..."|stage direction

puffing it to life as WHIP is beckoning with his large hands.
The YOUNG WOMAN, looking more like a stripper by the second,
hands the joint to WHIP who takes a masterful drag. WHIP
shakes his head in violent disapproval to what he hears on
the phone. He exhales in anger as he shouts into the phone."|stage direction
23|WHIP (CONT'D)|"NO! NO! NO! You decided he needed
private school...lemme talk to
Knuckles. He's not? Tell'em the
phone works both ways. Oh he's my

glad you tracked me down in Orlando
at 7 in the fucking morning to
shake me down for money. Does he
even like the fucking school? No

report.
(feels eyes of disbelief)
It was done incompetently. The
last time the toxicology equipment
they used was calibrated was in
June of 2009, which is 18 months
past code. Their log that should
clearly state who labeled the blood
vials and when, is very incomplete.
And they aren't sure who stored
them. They used a preservative in
the vials that has in some cases
caused blood to ferment and
register higher in an alcohol test.
That's what I've done so far. I
can handle this.

dead beers and an ashtray that overflows.
WHIP moves in drunken slow motion as he attempts to free a
cigarette from the pack and light it. He freezes at one

a strange, involuntary, drunken reset. His stare is a 1000

vodka, gin, wine, bourbon. The bottles SHIMMER -- AMBER,
CRYSTAL, EMERALD, RUBY.
WHIP reaches for a frosted vodka mini bottle -- he gently
pinches the neck of the bottle and lifts it out of the
fridge. He holds up the mini vodka and considers it.
Now Whip slowly removes the stopper and smells the White
Whiskey. He looks at the bottle once more, then slowly twists
the tiny cap back on.
With a look of solemn resignation, Whip places the frosted
mini bottle on top of the fridge and walks away.

that the aircraft was in a
relatively stable glide just prior
to the moment of impact.
However, according to the data we
retrieved from the cockpit data
recorders, at exactly 9:34, after
flying 27 minutes without incident,
the transponder recorded a loss in
altitude in excess of 4800 feet per
minute in what is considered a
""full pitch nose down"" attitude.
Then at 9:42, according to the data
recorders, a decision was made to
invert the aircraft. The NTSB has
created animated simulation that I
would like to play at this point."|speech

An NTSB animation shows the plane pitching down and we follow
it through the inversion of the plane while listening to the
real audio of the flight crew.
The animation has a split screen that also shows the
instruments and printed text of what's being said.
We hear...""What's your son's name?"" ""Why?"" ""The black box""
""I love you, Trevor. Be a good boy, Mommy loves you."" ""What
are we doing?! Why would I trim down?!"" ""We're gonna roll
it. Ready? Here we go. I've got control.""

That audio is tragic and
compelling. I chose to play that
part of the cockpit recording to
highlight a key moment aboard
flight 227, wherein you say ""We're
gonna roll it, here we go, I've got
control."" You made a very
conscious decision to invert the
airplane, to roll the plane upside
down. Is that correct?

Whitaker arrested the descent and

Apologies. I can do it manually."|speech

This is the jackscrew on the tail
assembly which articulates the
horizontal stabilizer--also known
as the elevator. As you can see,
the threads on this screw are
almost entirely gone. ""

Substandard thread life"" is how we
reported it. This part was
suggested as a maintenance
replacement in January of 2010. It
was never replaced.
This had 1200 additional hours of
flight on it. It finally failed."|speech

We watch the elevator acting as a wing on the tail that goes
up or down and makes a plane get lift or descend."|stage direction

Our investigators have concluded
that the jackscrew snapped and the
elevator was frozen in a fixed
position, locking the elevator in a
down position which forced the
plane into a dive. The loss of the
elevator was, and I quote our
report, a ""catastrophic event, from
which recovery was improbable and
stable flight impossible."""|speech
1681||"Everyone goes quiet as those words resonate. ELLEN's tone
changes as she understands how hard this is for some people
to hear as they think of their loved ones spending their last
living minutes on this earth in sheer terror.

silent."|stage direction

Again I quote...""From 9:34 until
9:42 the piloting decisions made by
Captain Whitaker were bold and
remarkable. The fact that Captain
Whitaker commanded that the

descending to an extremely low
altitude shows a miraculous
intuition that in this instance
saved 96 lives."""|speech

the days leading and hours leading
up to the accident. But before I
do, I want to remind you that you

ELLEN sorts through her notes one last time."|stage direction
1701|ELLEN BLOCK|"Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we're about
done.
(She refers to her notes)
Due to the severe turbulence during
the early part of the flight, you
asked the flight crew to suspend
the beverage service on the plane.
Is that correct?"|speech
1702|WHIP|"Yes. I suspended the drink
service."|speech
