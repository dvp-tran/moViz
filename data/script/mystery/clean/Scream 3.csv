Oh MY god.

as I feared, I did not survive these killings
here at Windsor College.   Anyway, the reason
I am here is to help you, so that my death
will not be in vain.  That my life's work, will
help save some other poor soul from getting mutilated.
If this killer does come back, and he's for real,
there are a few things that you gotta remember.
Is this simply another sequel?  Well, if it is, same
rules apply.  But, here's the critical thing.  If you
find yourself dealing with an unexpected backstory,
and a preponderance of exposition,  then the sequel
rules do not apply.  Because you are not dealing
with a sequel, you are dealing with the concluding
chapter of a trilogy."|speech|SIDNEYOh MY god.RANDY|?|
786|DEWEY|A trilogy?|speech|DEWEY|M|True
787|RANDY|"That's right.  It's a rarity in the horror field,
but it does exist, and it's a force to be reckoned
with, because true trilogies are all about going back
to the beginning and discovering something that wasn't
true from the get go.  'Godfather', 'Jedi', all revealed
something that we thought was true, that wasn't true.   So
if it is a trilogy you are dealing with, here are some
super trilogy rules.   One, you got a killer who's gonna be
super human.  Stabbing him won't work, shooting him
won't work, basically in the third one, you gotta
cryogenically freeze his head, decapitate him, or blow him
up.   Number two; anyone including the main character can
die.  This means you, Sid.  I'm sorry, it's the final
chapter.  It can be fuckin  'Reservoir Dogs' by the
time this thing is through.  Number three; the past
will come back to bite you in the ass!  Whatever you
think you know about the past, forget it.  The past is
not at rest, any sins you think were committed in
the past are about to break out and destroy you. NUMBER
FOUR,Never, ever under any circumstances go running off
by yourself, cause if Friday the 13th has taught us
anything, it's that the next time we're gonna see you,
you're gonna have a fence post jutting out from your
back. So in closing, let me say good luck, God Speed,
