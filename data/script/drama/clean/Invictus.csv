the freeway into Cape Town. The RUGBY FIELDS are immaculate.
FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BOYS in striped rugby jerseys train with
total intensity under the critical eye of the COACH.
Right ACROSS THE BOUNDARY FENCE from the rugby fields is an
area of WASTE LAND leading up to the freeway. There, BLACK
AND ""COLORED"" (MIXED-RACE) BOYS of the same age play a loose
game of soccer with a tennis ball. Most of them have bare
feet and threadbare, dirty clothes, most of them are
noticeably smaller and skinnier than the white boys.
Two cultures, separated by more than the high boundary fence.

Mandela looks for it for a moment, then closes the drawer,
looks at himself in the mirror. Mostly, Mandela's face is
warm, animated, energetic and this is how we see him, almost
all the time.
But, sometimes, his face can be a remote, sphinx-like mask
that conceals all emotion, all feeling. This is his prison
face.
This is the face that looks back at Mandela, right now, in
the mirror. It is the face of a man whose long, hard journey
has marked his very soul.

we can soar along the outside of the building and LOOK
THROUGH THE WINDOWS into the offices of state --

packing up, in anticipation of being booted out by the
Mandela regime. These characters run the gamut from little
old Afrikaner tea ladies in tears, to the stoic fossils of
grand apartheid. They are all white. A good third of the

For this is not a pretty match, not for one moment -- just as

This match is all about a less talented team stifling the

This is about the Springboks applying continuous, unrelenting
pressure, and forcing the vaunted All Black attack into
making mistakes. Lots of them.
Dropped balls, errant passes, knock-ons. No fluency of
movement, no electric building of momentum.
Because of one thing: tackling.
Tackling and tackling and tackling again.
The first time Lomu touches the ball, the stadium, the nation
holds its breath --
-- until the Springbok wing scythes into him at thigh height,
wraps him up and brings him down.

behind by Pienaar, with a picture perfect tackle.
We can cut away to the faces of the spectators when we want;
from Mandela to Nerine to Sipho and on and on, all over the
country. But, in truth, our attention belongs on the field.
ON PIENAAR, continually exhorting his men, leading by
example, wreaking havoc in the All Black backfield.
ON LOMU, who always seems just one broken tackle away from
running one in -- except that there are no broken tackles.
ON THIRTY BIG, STRONG, BATTLE-SCARRED MEN, who have devoted
their entire lives to this moment. They are not playing for
money. They are playing for pride, for their countries.
Outdated notions. We miss them.
No tries are scored in the Final. The two fly halves match
each other, penalty goal for penalty goal.

So tight, in fact, that there is only one score in the second
half -- an All Black drop goal that levels the score at 9 -

Until right before the end of the match, when the All Blacks
camp in the Springbok half.

Seven minutes."|speech|MANDELA|M

life. In every South African's life.
BEGIN CLIMAX SEQUENCE:
This is where we fold the Rainbow Nation into the rugby
match, fully.
INTERCUT BETWEEN PEOPLE ALL OVER SOUTH AFRICA, AND THE RUGBY
as we show the whole nation wanting exactly the same thing at
the same time. Faces, postures, eyes are identical, no
matter where they are, who they are, what color they are.
(It would be nice if we used all the faces we've already cut
away to throughout this story.)
ON THE FIELD
The All Blacks attack desperately. The Springboks tackle and
tackle and tackle.
ON PIENAAR, totally spent but dragging himself to his feet
for another tackle.
He glances over at the referee, makes another tackle --
-- looks over at the referee --
-- the referee puts his hands on his whistle --
-- another tackle, another look --
-- the referee lifts the whistle to his lips --
-- another tackle, another look --
-- the REFEREE BLOWS THE FINAL WHISTLE.
It's over.
The Springboks have won."|stage direction||
