Military Uniforms.  (Their anonymity is assured by the angles

another scar that distorts his lip slightly.  The names of
various battles have been neatly stenciled down his left arm, an
official record, not a decoration.  TODD is silent, staring into
space.  The room is full of SOLDIERS in T-shirts, fatigues,
sleepwear.  WORDS APPEAR SUPERED OVER THE SCENE...

Wearing dripping ponchos, CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK are looking

glowing with satisfaction.
The vast interior is so large that in spite of clusters of
stacked crates, part of a dismantled spaceship, a rusty
earthmover, numerous large pieces of machinery, and a whole
arrangement of exercise gear, the place has huge open spaces and

As TODD glances at them, the NEW SOLDIERS look back unblinkingly.

through the thick scratched plexiglass window.  The wild blurs of

SQUEALS of sound barely audible over the deafening ROAR of the

puzzlement when he is suddenly distracted by a change in the

arrived has diminished to a strong breeze.
TODD tries sitting up.  The breeze doesn't overpower him.  He
looks around.
The meaningless SHRIEKS of the pillow fight, though still muffled
by heavy plexiglass, are LOUDER now, but TODD's attention is on
the other window/skylight that glows from this strange ""roof"" and
on the strange sound that's coming to him, borne on the breeze...
a MUSICAL sound.
Struggling weakly to his feet, TODD staggers toward the next
window.  The MUSIC is LOUDER as he approaches -- it's waltz music
played on an accordion.
TODD drops to his knees and peers through the next window.
TODD'S POV through the second ""window,"" another mysterious

What he's seeing indistinctly through the thick plexiglass is an

moving as one, first this way, then that, in time to a WALTZ.  In
the corner, another person is making a strange movement that
seems to initiate the music...

given way to a deathly stillness, the mysterious (to him) MUSIC
is clearly audible as TODD peers through the plexiglass at the
warm scene below, as puzzled by the waltzing couple as by the
pillow fights.
Then he gets to his feet again and in the stillness makes his way
past a smoking chimney toward the next window.  Halfway there he
freezes...listening!
A strange haunting WHISTLING sound is coming from somewhere...
TODD looks around at the blackness beyond the roof windows.
There's nothing visible...
The mysterious sound is louder now, drowning out the music

now he seems to re-consider TODD, revealing for the first time a
genuine respect.
As their eyes meet, CAINE 607 seems to be saying ""All right then,

not just my ass, it's yours too!
You've got to stand by me on this.
I want you to come in right now...
right now!  Do you understand me?
Right now!"|location

look and no words are necessary.
RILEY reaches for the control switch as MEKUM continues babbling."|stage direction

addressing TODD and the VETERANS collectively."|stage direction
1489||"Well then, I guess you fellas are
all right.  I guess I misjudged you
some.  Where I said you were ""a

my sincere approval and support."|location

1492||"NATHAN wobbles along an empty corridor, stumbles, catches himself
on a wall, keeps going.
He passes a doorway, peers in, sees two SOLDIERS working at a
console like robots.  They don't look up.
NATHAN keeps going, toddling toward a hatchway."|stage direction

NATHAN keeps going.
Then, backing against a wall, he looks up and VETERANS loom past
him with blank faces.  He is alone again.
NATHAN totters onward.
CLOSE ANGLE ON CHARTS, the same ones Church had on Christmas Eve,
showing tiny dots in a vast sea of space.
TODD and RILEY are poring over them, their eyes considering dot
after dot.  Finally, TODD points to a dot and looks a question at
RILEY.
RILEY considers the dot for a long moment...then he looks TODD in
the eye."|stage direction

TODD is thoughtful...finally asks the next question."|stage direction

1503||That one.|location
1504||Aye, aye, sir.|location
1505||"RILEY turns toward a console, but something makes him look down
toward his feat.  Then he looks back at TODD.
TODD follows the look.
Tiny NATHAN is looking up at TODD who's towering over him.
TODD looks down without expression, the scarf from Jimmy Pig
still wrapped around his neck.
NATHAN puts his arms out to be picked up.
TODD considers the outstretched arms.
RILEY looks from TODD to NATHAN and back to TODD.  What's this?
TODD hesitates a half second more, then leans down and picks
NATHAN up in his arms, lifting the boy to his chest.
RILEY looks on.  Never seen anything like it.
NATHAN is close to TODD's face, looking right into it, trying a
little smile, a nervous one, looking for a response.
TODD hesitates, takes a breath, moves the muscles of his face.
All he can produce is an awkward grimace, the distortion of a
smile, almost comical.
NATHAN reads the intention successfully.  His face collapses into
a huge friendly grin.
TODD tries again, making a clumsy sort of rubbery wince.
RILEY watches.  Totally amazed.
TODD turns, takes NATHAN to a porthole, puts his face up to it.
NATHAN stares out at the darkness punctuated by a billion stars,
a sky full of hope.
As NATHAN looks out, TODD works his face again, trying for a
smile the way a weak man might try to lift a heavy weight.
NATHAN looks at the stars outside, TODD looks with him and
suddenly TODD's face relaxes into an awkward grin, almost by
accident.
RILEY watches the two of them for a moment, confounded by what
