Suddenly with a brilliant FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT, a
nuclear EXPLOSION mushrooms into the sky.
We SEE a SERIES of REAL shots of footage of some of the
over one hundred and sixty official nuclear tests the
French government held in this tropical region.
Explosion after explosion devastates the locale. One
building after the next, accelerating in momentum,
culminating in one final EXPLOSION.
The clould-filled sky begins to drizzle. The ash-like
fallout drifts downward onto what's left of the islands
below.
We FOLLOW this ash as it settles next to a dead reptile,
unrecognizable now, and down onto what's left of the
lizard's eggs.
Suddenly the image clears from the grainy footage to
clean, modern high resolution. We ZOOM IN on one of the
eggs as it slowly gets buried in the falling ash. WE

ERUPTS and GODZILLA RISES, ripping up the boulevard as

apparently looking Nick in the eye.

hoisted rocket launchers prepared.
Out of the corner of his eye, Nick sees all this. He
gently signals with his hands that they should NOT fire.
