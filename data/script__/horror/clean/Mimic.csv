Stygean darkness.
Wet CLICKING SOUNDS. A BEAM of purplish ULTRA-VIOLET LIGHT
reveals a mosaic of moving forms... COCKROACHES. They skitter
restlessly under the beam's intensity. SERIES OF SHOTS -- the
UV Beam passing over various parts of the space. Pipe webs,
walls, girders -- all covered with the insects. Thousands of
them.

A GROUP OF FIGURES advances through the tunnels with handheld
UV lamps.
The figures are dressed in gray air-tight NEOPRENE SUITS,
their faces hidden by skin tight MASKS and bug-like NIGHT
VISION GOGGLES. In the dense silence, respirator valves HISS-
CLICK at the corner of their lips in mechanical rhythm.
The scene has a dream-like, choreographed quality.
NIGHT-VISION POV
Eerie, aquatic green.  The horde of insects appear to be some
kind of sea-life, crawling over the floor of a dead ocean.
THE TEAM OF FIGURES
From their midst appears another FIGURE, its neoprene suit a
flat WHITE.  Female, clearly the TEAM LEADER.
She carries a stainless steel CONTAINER filled with twenty
small compartments, each bearing a large, heavy-shelled roach
with a different BARCODE on their back.
JUDAS ROACHES.
She kneels and opens the
CASE
TCHK!! A dozen of the Judas roaches are released.  They slide
through into the area.
THE NEARBY ROACHES
react instantaneously.  In a rustle of tiny legs, they begin
to stream toward the Judases.
Jostle and fight each other for position to mate with them.
They even crawl over the Team Leader in an effort to reach
the Judases.  The Team Leader makes no effort to brush them
off.  Patient, almost godlike, she watches the MATING.
LATER
A MANHOLE has been opened above. CHAINS are dropped down and
attached by a Team Member to A 100-GALLON DISPOSAL DRUM.
REVEAL the floor of the tunnel, carpeted with the still forms
of the roaches, now all DEAD.
The Team Members quietly shovel the tiny corpses into other
disposal drums.
At their feet skitter the only survivors of the massacre:
the bar-coded Judas Roaches.
In a crunch of machinery, the first disposal drum is lifted
by the chains through the manhole to"|stage direction||

Dirty snow drifts over Bryant Park. Emergency lights blink
everywhere. A wall of cars sits on Sixth Avenue, stopped
dead. Exhaust fumes hang in the air. Jaded TRAFFIC COPS send
the cars on crosstown detours.
Mounted policemen patrol a line of yellow sawhorses near
dozens of Department of Public Health vehicles, angle-parked
in a military phalanx.
A monumental ribcage-like scaffolding has been erected in the
middle of the street, ""sealing"" the area with amber plastic.
Inside, UNIFORMED WORKERS take the disposal drum of roaches
and toss it into one of a number of huge DUMPSTERS.
The Team Leader watches from nearby, exhauster.  Her mask is
off. We see her face: Enthomologist SUSAN WYETH, 28.
An ARM gently drapes over her shoulder."|stage direction||

97||EXT. ALPHABET CITY - NIGHT|location||
98||"The WILLIAMSBURG BRIDGE dimly visible through the rain.
ALPHABET CITY STREETS
Empty warehouses. Closed businesses. Traffic lights blinking
on empty streets. Everything seems doomed under the heavy
layer of rain.
SUPERIMPOSE:  TWO YEARS LATER
A DILAPIDATED BUILDING before us. A blazing NEON CROSS made
of the words 'JESUS SAVES' hangs askew from its facade.
CRANE to see the ROOFTOP.
WHAM! The door to the interior stairs FLIES OPEN and a tall,
thin CHINESE PREACHER in his sixties lurches out, eyes wild
with terror.
He looks back down the steps.
Something's climbing up fast, casting ominous, complex
shadows on the wall.
Too many FOOTSTEPS for it to be just one person.
The man hurriedly shuts the door and slides a bolt home.
Trembling, he backs away as a booming THUD makes the door
shudder. Raw, frenzied pounding and scratching follows...
something inhuman, determined to break through.
The metal surface suddenly buckles and bulges.
On the man's white undershirt, a blotch of blood starts to
grow.  Needles of rain stab his flesh.
He searches wildly for a possible escape.
He reaches the edge of the roof: it's five floors down to the
sidewalk.
Two of the hinges on the door come loose, pulverizing the
surrounding concrete.
WHAM!  The door to the stairs bulges outward as something
SMASHES against it again and again.  Frenzied SCRATCHING.
The man sprints to the other end of the roof. There, on the
adjoining building...
THE CHINESE PREACHER'S POV
Just one floor below on the building across the alley is a
suspended PAINTERS' PLATFORM, crowded with paint cans under a
tarp.  A two-story old EYEWEAR ADVERTISEMENT from the 40's is
being painted over.
THE CHINESE PREACHER
Looks back to the door.  BAM! a tremendous SHATTERING sound.
LIGHT spills from inside. Two bolts fly in the air, a hinge
gives.
He CRIES OUT in terror.
The man gauges the distance between buildings; can he make
it?
He takes a few steps back, a few more...
Panting hard, he closes his eyes, his chest soaked in blood
and rain.
THE DOOR EXPLODES OUTWARD AND SKIDS ACROSS THE SLIPPERY ROOF.
Light from inside projects the shadow of wild, busy things
onto the curtain of rain.
Weeping with fear, the man desperately tries to hurl himself
to the catwalk.
It's too far.
He FALLS...CRASH!  he hits the platform, knocking boards
loose and sending paint cans onto their sides, rolling.  He
bounces, slides off the edge, barely able to grab onto a
loose board to save himself from falling.
The RAIN blasts down.  The scaffold CREAKS.  He hits the
edge, upsetting the cans of paint there.
He holds onto the planks with all his might, trying to push
with his feet, but they slide on the wet wall.
BELOW
Cans bounce off the pavement. White pain blasts all over.
CU HANDS
The man's hands slip on the planks, tiring.
FEET
The Chinese Preacher's FEET bicycle in the air, unable to
find a purchase on the wet brick wall-
THE CHINESE PREACHER
is hanging just in front of the painted EYE of the forties'
model.  He looks up above him, sees something-"|stage direction||
99|CHINESE PREACHER|No.  Please, God, no!|speech|CHINESE PREACHER|M
100||"A SHADOW crosses his face as something looms above him.
Suddenly there is a CRACK and the platform tilts completely
on one end.
HANDS
The Chinese Preacher's fingernails dig in, then slip on the
wet wood.
His hands paw the air.
WIDER
For a moment his body, silhouetted in the rain, seems
suspended in a void. Then he falls backwards.
THE GROUND
Impact. His body cracks the pavement.
Small pools of rain form on his dead, open eyes.
We CRANE to reveal
A WINDOW ON A BUILDING ACROSS THE STREET
CHUY, a young Latino boy. He stares out the window at the
Chinese Preacher's body with no discernable emotion.
He works a small WIRE SCULPTURE in his hands.
APARTMENT
It's a small one-bedroom apartment.
An old man sleeps peacefully on a cot: Chuy's grandfather.
MANNY GAVIOLA, mid 60's, white hair haloes his handsome,
benign face.
All around him: SHOES, shoes everywhere you look, on the
table, on the chairs, on the kitchen counter, on the floor.
A small altar is illuminated by votive candles. Next to it,
standing by the window is
CHUY
HIS P.O.V.
We see a blurry vision of The Chinese Preacher's splayed
figure in a swirl of color.
Chuy's attention focuses on the Preacher's shoes.
CHUY"|stage direction||

102|CHUY|Oxfords, 8 1/2. Black...|speech|CHUY|M
103||"He looks away from the body and goes back to twisting the
wire into shape.
THE PUDDLE OF PAINT
around the preacher, reflects large shadows moving above,
and across the neon sign...
CHUY
hears a strange sound, a rhythmic clicking.
His head lifts and what he sees causes his expression to
change--there is an uncharacteristic flicker of excitement in
his eyes.
ACROSS THE ROOFTOP
We are behind whatever it is that has captured Chuy's
attention.
TICKETY-TACKETY-TOCK...
The strange clicking sound grows louder.  The figure begins
moving in some weird, preparatory fashion. Then it steps
forward and drops out of frame.
CHUY
His eyes follow the figure down to the pavement in a slow
arc.
Chuy puts down the wire miniature and opens the window to get
a better view.
GROUND LEVEL
The Chinese Preacher's body is now being dragged toward the
rear of the alley, leaving colored paint smears in its wake.
CHUY
We isolate the boy's face and, on the soundtrack, every other
noise FADES AWAY.
Chuy reaches for a pair of SPOONS nearby.
He begins to click them together.
Imitating the strange clicking sound heard a moment ago.
THE CHINESE PREACHER
is being pulled into a small, ground-level vent. The only
problem is that no human is small enough to squeeze through
this hole.
CHUY
watches, still clicking with his spoons.
THE CHINESE PREACHER'S BODY
is stuck. One of his legs is through the hole up to the
thigh, but the other is folded up unnaturally and pressing
against the wall next to the vent. Impossible.
There is a silent beat, and then a series of INCREDIBLY
VIOLENT TUGS, BAM! BAM! BAM! shaking the Paint-soaked body
like a rag doll.
CHUY
His spoons stop. His jaw tightens a little as we hear
terrible cracking and scraping sounds.
THE WINDOW
The Chinese Preacher's head and hands disappear into the
hole. Bits of clothing, paint and blood stick to the edges of
the opening.
CHUY
watches, still fascinated."|stage direction||

The derelict spots Peter.  He picks up his chalk, drifts off.
Intrigued, Peter goes closer to the drawing. An arrow points
to a manhole cover set among the bushes.
Peter circles around, trying to make sense out of the lines.

Josh cautiously enters a vaulted area.  Old pipes have been
ripped from the walls.  WATER gushes over the steel-plated
walls.  He looks around- this doesn't seem familiar.
Josh freezes as he sees something behind a loose metal PLATE
on the wall.
He yanks at the plate- it gives a little bit. He yanks
harder- the plate falls down on one side, hanging
precariously from a loose bolt.
It reveals A HOLE PACKED WITH DOZENS AND DOZENS OF OOTHECAS.
He leans close to examine them- there is a NOISE in the
tunnel behind him-
JOSH'S POV - WATERFALL
A curtain of WATER falls over the side of a pipe onto the
floor.  Behind it, something ENORMOUS crawls into view.
Multiple legs, antennae, an elongated body distorted by the
water and the light of a flare.  It stops-
JOSH
Holding his breath and tiptoeing sideways, never taking his
eyes off the thing, Josh begins to move away.  He sees a
narrow OPENING in the wall- there seems to be dim LIGHT
coming from something beyond it.  He tries to squeeze through
the opening-
MIMIC
The creature is immobile behind the sheet of water, as if
mesmerized by its flow-
PIT - JOSH
With tremendous effort, Josh passes through the opening.
He finds himself inside a bowl-shaped mud hole.  Scattered
around him he sees FUNNY BUNNY PATCHES that were sewn in the
sweatshop.  He trips on a half-buried SEWING MACHINE.  He
looks up-
