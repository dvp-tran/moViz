ACTRESS - glamorous, young - but very much in the back
ground of the scene - a secretary typing at her desk."|speech
3|REVERSE|"A YOUNG BOY sits watching the film, his clothes and the
room around him telling us this is England in the 1960s. He
is staring raptly at the actress.
SIDNEY (V.O.)
All my life I've been a Looky-

past us with a dazzling smile.
SIDNEY (V.O.)
My name's Sidney Young. I'm a
journalist...a hack. (Beat) Yeah,
that...that isn't me.
We PAN right and down to our hero - SIDNEY YOUNG -
thirties, an odd-ball with a knack for getting people to
dislike him.
SIDNEY (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
This is me at the Golden Globe
Awards in L.A. this year. That's
my Armani tuxedo. That's a Rolex
Sea-Dweller 4000 watch I'm
wearing.
Still in SLOW-MOTION we TRACK BACK and see that Sidney is
at a table with several other people, all staring raptly
past us to the stage which is out of shot."|speech
6|SIDNEY (CONT'D)|"Those people all around me -
they're all famous. They're my
friends.
Beside him sits a beautiful young woman - SOPHIE MAES
(20's).
2.
SIDNEY (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
That's the actress Sophie Maes.
This morning she told me she
would let me have sex with her if
she won the Best Actress Award.
Still in SLOW MOTION, Sophie suddenly covers her face with
her hands and begins to stand.
SIDNEY (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
She just won the Best Actress
Award.
Sophie walks out of the shot. Still sporting the fixed
smile, Sidney claps in SLO-MO along with everyone else in
the room. We TRACK away from Sidney past tables of
CELEBRITIES towards an EXIT."|speech
7|SIDNEY (CONT'D)|"My life didn't used to be like
this.
We PUSH THROUGH the EXIT DOORS and find ourselves
impossibly looking at..."|speech

their necks to see us more clearly, waving, cheering,
shouting, cameras flashing... Rain lashes down.
A CAPTION reads: ""Sidney's Life, One Year Ago. Bafta
Awards. London.""
SIDNEY (V.O.)
Looky-Loos. That's what They call
you when you stand out in the
rain all night just to catch a
glimpse of Them going by.
REVERSE - CELEBRITIES walk down the red carpet, pausing to
wave at the fans."|speech
10|SIDNEY (CONT'D)|"I used to pretend it was
different for me because I was
getting paid by a magazine or
newspaper, whatever. But that's,
you know...I just loved watching
Them. I'd stand outside looking
in through the window and think
what it would be like to somehow
get inside. But there was only
one way to get past the thin red
line that separates the
celebrities from the civilians.
You had to be famous.

11||4A EXT. SECURITY POINT - LATE AFTERNOON 4A|stage direction
12|SIDNEY (CONT'D)|"Sidney stands talking to a young PR WOMAN at the security

13|PR WOMAN|Babe?|speech
14|SIDNEY|"Babe Three. Yeah.
She looks doubtfully at the pig."|speech
15|PR WOMAN|Babe was a cute little piglet.|speech

little piglet too. What do you
want? Tempus Fugits..."|speech
17|PR WOMAN|He hasn't got any ID.|speech
18|SIDNEY|"How many pigs are coming tonight?
Look, I was told to bring him,
hand him over to the producer,
Bob Milton, inside. You want me
to leave him here with you,
that's fine..."|speech
19|PR WOMAN|"No, you can't leave him with me.
I've got...Hold on, I'll...
She looks around, helplessly. She begins to unhook the red
rope. Sidney tries to hide his excitement.
PR WOMAN (CONT'D)
If you're positive that you're
supposed to...
An OLDER PR WOMAN stalks over.
OLDER PR WOMAN"|speech
20|(ICILY)|Well, well, Sidney Young.|speech
21|"SIDNEY
(RUMBLED)"|"Well, well...clipboard Nazi-type
woman.
She turns to the SECURITY standing beside them.
OLDER PR WOMAN
The pig doesn't get in.

She starts to walk away."|speech

OLDER PR WOMAN
I was talking about you."|speech
23||5 MOMENTS LATER 5|location
24|SIDNEY|"Sidney and the Pig are being ""escorted"" away from the red
carpet by the Security.
SIDNEY (V.O.)
The Looky-Loos dream is that one
day they will somehow get to
mingle with the stars. But the
Industry can't allow any
mingling. Stars have to be kept
away from civilians, have to be
quarantined, so they don't become
normal. Like us.
They pass a ravishing HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS walking the other
way. She looks curiously at the pig as she passes. Sidney
stares after her, longingly."|speech

exclusive hotel.
SIDNEY (V.O.)
But after the awards come the
parties - the Miramax Party, the
London Records Party and, best of
all - the Sharps Magazine Party,
so exclusive that there are no
pass-alongs, no plus-ones, no
press.

We see the PIG'S SNOUT poking out of the zip of the
holdall."|speech
31||8 INT. HOTEL ROOM - EVENING 8|stage direction
32|HORRIFIED)|"Sidney turns from the mirror to face us. He is wearing a
WAITER'S UNIFORM of white shirt, waistcoat, and bow tie. He
is also wearing a WIG and FALSE MOUSTACHE.
SIDNEY (V.O.)
And that is when I strike.
He picks up a tray of canapés from the bed and looks down
to where the Pig watches him from the floor."|speech
33|SIDNEY (CONT'D)|"I want you in bed by ten. And no

He tosses the pig one of the canapés."|speech
34||9 INT. HOTEL - EVENING 9|stage direction
35|SIDNEY (CONT'D)|"Sidney, tray in hand, peers around the corner to the
entrance to the hotel's roofed COURTYARD. The Older PR

the courtyard beyond."|speech

in the white shirt and black trousers. He scoops up a
passing glass of champagne, checks his moustache and
surveys the courtyard - a room full of glamour: tanned

champagne. He stands surveying the crowd of A-list
celebrities in front of him, dazed."|speech

You're a star. You're a big,
bright shining star...

40|"SIDNEY
(TO HIMSELF)"|"The room is trashed - furniture over-turned, mini-bar open
and broken bottles all over the floor. A weird squealing
which could almost be human is coming from the bathroom.
ASSISTANT MANAGER (O.S.)
Hello? Sir?
The squealing stops.
ASSISTANT MANAGER (CONT'D)
Is everything alright?
The door opens and the Assistant Manager walks in and
stands staring around him in horror. Behind him the pig
emerges from the bathroom and slips out of the open door,
across the corridor and straight into the open lift..."|speech

45|SIDNEY|Oh, I'm a writer. Movie writer.|speech
46|HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS|Oh great.|speech
47|SIDNEY|"Yeah. Got one in pre-production
now. You know it's really weird
running into you like this
because just the other day I was
telling the producer I thought
you'd be perfect for the lead.
She starts to laugh."|speech
48|SIDNEY (CONT'D)|"No, seriously, you would,
because, you know, you have this
mixture of intelligence and
beauty and fragility that we're
looking for and, uh...

She laughs."|speech
51|"SIDNEY (CONT'D)
(SMILING)"|"I'm joking, I'm just...It's a bio-
pic. About Greta Garbo. That's
why I thought of you. You have
those amazing cheek-bones
and...are they real? Have you had
plastic surgery?"|speech
52|HOLLYWOOD ACTRESS|No. Have you?|speech
53|SIDNEY|"Me? No, hardly anything. A penis
reduction as a child, that's
pretty much...
She laughs again, snorting into her drink. Sidney can't
believe this - she likes him!"|speech

67|SIDNEY (CONT'D)|How'd you do?|speech
68||"The Actress stares at him in surprise but Sidney doesn't
notice - he is staring past her to where there is something
of a COMMOTION amongst the guests. The PR Woman is hurrying
across the room, hissing into her ear-piece. Somebody
screams. Then to Sidney's horror a group of guests scatter
in panic and the cause of the commotion is revealed: the
Pig charges into view, heading straight for him."|stage direction

He lights a cigarette with a thoughtful air and watches
Sidney's flight, rolling the BOOK OF MATCHES between his
fingers.
BACK WITH SIDNEY
...as the Pig catches up with him and lunges at his ankles.
Sidney screams, trips and flies through the air, wig
spinning free, hurtling straight towards a table of
startled celebrities. We FREEZE FRAME.
