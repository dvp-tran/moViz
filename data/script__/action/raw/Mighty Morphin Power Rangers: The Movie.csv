The Rangers are fast asleep.  A night wind WHISTLES through the
trees, causing the branches to shiver.
After a moment, there's movement in the bushes.  Suddenly,
amazingly, a WOLF emerges -- his mane glistening in the
moonlight, his eyes GLOWING LIKE FIRE.
He surveys the sleeping clan, moves straight toward Billy.  He
stands inches away from him, watches him with an intense gaze.
Billy stirs slightly.
The embers cast an orange glow on Kimberly's sleeping face
A SHADOW moves over her and two CRANE LEGS step into frame.
There's a FLURRY OF FLAPPING WINGS as a FALCON SWOOPS DOWN and
lands on a rock directly above Tommy.  The bird fixes on Tommy
with its piercing eyes.
We hear a GRUNTING SOUND as the SILHOUETTE OF AN APE APPEARS:
Now a FROG HOPS through the air and lands inches away from
Adam.  The frog sits there a moment, it's THROAT THROBBING
Now we hear a DEEP GROWL and a tree SHAKES.  Aisha fidgets in
her sleep as an ENORMOUS BEAR SHADOW FALLS OVER HER.
Now, all at once, the six animals VANISH INTO THIN AIR LIKE
