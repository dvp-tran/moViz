looks like a stupid move, since Mitch is bigger -"|speech

What are you, the morals police?
He pushes again and Mitch,s hand shoots out like a snake
striking. Grabs him by the collar. Lifts him. A frozen
moment, more violence just a breath away, and a sense of things
about to spin out of control... Our Hero's eyes are popping;
he tries to hide his fear:"|speech

I were just having some fun -"|speech

Was it two hundred or five?"|speech

Our Hero does his best to recollect his dignity. Looks at
Slim. Drops a ten on the table and smirks:"|speech

know you? Way too high.

his words. Since he's protecting Slim, the power is"|speech
89|"COMFORTING:

Our Hero nods nervously.
Mitch steps back 3 inches, just far enough to let our Hero
leave. Which he does with considerable relief.
Slim's leaning vs. the counter, shaken, tears in her eyes -
Mitch tugs his baseball cap, mutters as he heads for the door:"|speech

If I'd kept my mouth shut, I'd'a

She nods.
He ambles out the door. A touch of the cowboy in him.
She shakes her head, looks at Ginny.
Ginny gestures as if to say, well?
At first Slim doesn't get it.
Ginny gestures more urgently: Come on. What're you waiting

Bacchanalian DANCING. French Champagne has flowed; shoes and
inhibitions were abandoned hours ago. THE CAMERA weaves
through the DANCERS to find:
Slim and Mitch, dancing close, never quite touching, every move
intense, physical, like subtle public sex. Their eyes are
locked; she runs her veil down his body, his hand lightly
touches her ass; they slow down and stand, lips a millimeter
apart but not quite kissing, the sexual tension building...
We see how crazy they are about each other, how completely
physically involved - and how much fun they have.
Watching them is Phil, with Mitch's parents, MRS. TYLER (58,
confident, at ease with her power and family money, and
likeable despite monstrous flaws) and MR. TYLER (someone Mrs.
Tyler married in a moment of cupidity).

uncomfortable in her Maid-of-Honor dress).

course he loves her; she nicked him to give her away.

of her dress (so the back of his hands touch her breasts; is
this going too far?). He pulls her to him, whispers:"|speech

I don't deserve to get laid? Please.
I'm a man, Slim. With the

And glances at SECOND LETTER:
SLIM (V.0.)
""Perhaps with your new attitude,
we can really work something out.
Per your last letter, I'll see you
the evening of...""
She puts the letters in the drawer where the pistol was.
They're not in envelopes; they're loose, open.
She picks up the metal detector, resumes her search.
The machine beeps insistently around his desk. She can't find
anything. Finally she discovers a false bottom on one of the
drawers: a second gun is in there.
With the gun are papers: reports from private detectives
looking for her, an assessment of his custody rights...
She hides the guns in the bottom of the laundry hamper.
Finds a photo of herself with Mitch and Gracie. Rips it up.
Puts the metal detector back in the duffle.
Changes into sweatshirt and sweatpants.
Takes the distinctive red bag (from the electronics store) out
of the duffle. There's a machine inside. She plugs it in,
tucks it behind the couch.
Puts her cell phone beside it."|speech
968|104|"She makes one last check: every wall, surface, every drawer.
Barefoot, she begins to glide around the space. Backing up.
Moving with ease and grace, sliding deftly to the side as she
approaches a couch, desk, chair. She's building on her earlier
reconnaissance: learning where the furniture is and how to
navigate around it..."|speech
969|DISSOLVE TO:|"LATER. MAGIC HOUR.
Light fading toward darkness. She's still moving backward,
only now her sliding is smooth, graceful; almost a dance.
As if hearing a distant signal, she slows to a stop.
For a long moment she stands perfectly still. Poised. Like an
animal in the forest.
There's a chair facing the front door. She glances at it. No.
She walks behind the couch, turns off the machine, picks up her
cell phone and auto-dials."|speech

Slim says nothing.

Silence."|speech

Turns on the light.
He walks back to the rear of the space, hangs up his coat.
Goes into the bedroom area, takes off his jacket.
The lights go out.
Mitch freezes, shadow on shadow, a silhouette in the darkness.
He looks out the window, sees:
The neighboring buildings still have light and power.
He cocks his head, listening.
Silence.
Walks to the door of the bedroom area. Waits.
Take two more steps -"|speech
980|SLIM'S VOICE|"It's me.
He nods slowly."|speech
981|MITCH|Yeah. (I thought so.)|speech
982|106|"He moves quietly to the bed... to the night table where Slim
found the pistol. Covers this by talking:
MITCH {CONT.}
This morning too?"|speech
983|SLIM'S VOICE|"You always did forget to turn off
the coffee.
He rummages in the drawer. We hear the RUSTLE of the letters
Slim put there. He fails to find the gun. Gives up trying to
be quiet, tosses papers onto the floor -
SLIM'S VOICE {CONT.}
I found it, Mitch.
His hand leaves the drawer.
He thinks.
Picks up the phone, listens. Dead.
Looks around... can't see her...
Goes back to the chair where he hung his sports coat and fishes
out his cell phone. We see the GLOW of its dial.
He punches 911 and pressed SEND.
The dial goes dark for two seconds, then blinks back on.
He stares at it.
Tries again. 911, SEND.
Again it goes dead."|speech
984|SLIM'S VOICE|"It's a machine. Knocks out cell
phones.
He throws the cell phone onto the bed.
Walks out of the bedroom area.
Looks around the vast space.
Spooky. Slanting light and dense shadow.
He doesn't see her."|speech
985|107|Walks toward his desk.|speech
986|SLIM'S VOICE|"I found that gun too.
He stops. Doesn't know where to go. or what to do."|speech
987|SLIM'S VOICE|Scared?|speech
988|"MITCH
(FUCK YOU)"|Of what?|speech
989|SLIM'S VOICE|"Now is when you decide, Mitch.
(off his silence)
Whether you're a coward. If you
are, you can run. I won't stop you."|speech

You have my guns."|speech

You're sayin' this is man to man?"|speech
997|SLIM'S VOICE|Woman, Mitch.|speech

MITCH"|"That's what I meant: man against
woman - you sure that's fair?
The lights go back on.
Slowly Slim comes out from hiding..."|speech
999|SLIM|"Fair to whom?
As he realizes her meaning, she moves into the open area
between two couches.
She has no weapon.
She's barefoot, in her sweats, feet spread for balance, arms
just slightly raised. Compared to him: she's tiny.
He moves toward her."|speech
1000|SLIM|"This is what you wanted, right?
What you were going to San Francisco
for: the chance to get me alone?
He lunges for her; she slides to the side and he misses.
He begins to stalk her.
And as he stalks, she moves backward, slowly and gracefully, in
the way she was practicing."|speech
1001|MITCH|"I don't understand, Slim.
How does this work for you?
She ignores his words. Watches his eyes and his chest. Wants
to know where he's going to attack.
MITCH (CONT.)
I mean: this is carefully thought
out, right?
She does not respond.
He throws three punches. None of them hits her.
He's unfazed, keeps stalking..."|speech
1002|109|"MITCH (CONT.)
But say you succeed - beat me up
or whatever. You're not going to
murder me... (CONT.)
Her expression remains neutral, focused.
He takes this to be agreement.
MITCH (CONT.)
So all you've done is further
piss me off."|speech
1003|SLIM|"Self defense is not ,murder.
This stops him cold.. He lowers his hands a moment. Stares at
her, trying to assimilate this new information..."|speech
1004|MITCH|"You don't have the guts.
She just looks at him.
He blinks, worried for an instant. Covers it with a smile:"|speech
1005|MITCH|"It's not self-defense when you
break in here and attack me."|speech
1006|SLIM|"So far you're attacking me.
He lunges, almost hits her, rushes in -
She has to leap sideways with great speed and dexterity: jumps
over the couch to avoid being hit.
He also jumps over the couch, but his balance isn't as good,
and she's waiting for him as he stumbles -
With perfect balance and full force, she slugs him in the nose.
He goes down. Stays there. For the first time it occurs to
him: this might not be easy.
He climbs to his feet, feels his nose: blood."|speech
1007|SLIM|"You see? I'm just defending myself.
He resumes stalking her. Only he's angry now, and it's scary."|speech
1008|"110
MITCH"|"If you fail, you can count on this:
you'll never see Gracie again.
She reacts -
He sees it, rushes her -
Punching as he goes. From the standpoint of pure physics, he
makes a terrifying force. Until:
She steps back, grabs his arm, whips him vs. the brick wall -
He hits it, bounces off.
Cut on his forehead, blood streaming down his face.
He stares at her... breathing hard... trying to put it together:"|speech
1009|MITCH|"You really (think) ...you think you'll
kill me and get away with it?l"|speech
1010|SLIM|"I told you. Self-defense. I came
here, as arranged in our letters, to
talk about Gracie -"|speech
1011|MITCH|Letters? There are no -|speech
1012|SLIM|"In the drawer where your pistol was.
You just left prints all over them.
He stares at her, stunned in every way. Touches his forehead,
feels the blood..."|speech
1013|SLIM|"You attacked me, I fought back. And
of course if you never touch me..."|speech
1014|(SWEET SMILE)|"I'll have to give myself bruises...
He goes berserk. Leaps at her, covering ground quickly with
his long stride, swinging his massive arms. This is the most
terrifying form of combat: a huge person attacking a tiny one.
If he should hit her even once, a glancing blow, she will go
down, she will break, it will be over."|speech
1015|III|"But he misses, and misses again. Sometimes his punches are
wild, almost comical. Others come so close we hear-the wind,
feel their power, feel his sweat on her...
CONTINUE this terrifying choreographed dance with destruction
for as long as it will hold. At every instant, we fear for her
bones and her life. Sometimes she leans back like Muhammad Ali
to barely slip a punch, and we see terror on her face, married
to determination. She knows the score. and the odds.
Finally, in frustration at so many misses, he grabs an ashtray,
hurls.it at her -
it flies over her head -
He punches again and again, wildly.
She remains untouched.
He stops. With all the blood, he looks like a wild animal.
He makes a great effort to pull himself together..."|speech
1016|MITCH|"This doesn't bother me, Slim.
I don't care how long it takes.
We both know: Ionly have to hit
you once. Once, and it's over.
She laughs at him.
This is the last thing he expected and the last thing he can
stand. He rushes at her again, fast -
She starts left -
He blocks her way -
She starts right -
Again he's blocking her -
She lunges to the left, through a narrow space -
He punches, grazing her hair; punches again, just missing, and
a third time. We feel the awesome power behind these blows.
She's in the clear again. Smiles casually. Clearly part of
her strategy is to keep him angry:"|speech
1017|"112
SLIM"|"I'm confused, Mitchy. Aren't you a
man?"|speech
1018|(QUOTING HIM)|"I thought it was ""no contest?""
I mean, can't you hit me even once?
He grabs a lamp, yanks out the cord, wields it like a club.
SLIM (CONT.)"|speech
1019|(AMUSED)|"A weapon?
He smashes the lamp down, just missing her head -

SLAM -"|"He misses her three times, the last time smashing the lamp into
the wall so hard that the impact hurts his hand. He yelps -
SLIM (CONT.)
You see?
He turns toward her, pain on his face, holding his hand -
And she truly attacks for the first time. Smashes her fist
against his head -
He flies back, bounces vs. the wall.
As he comes off it, she punches him again -
He roars with rage, lunges at her, head first, great speed -
She hurtles him in the same direction, increasing speed -
Right into the opposite wall.

Gives him a reflex test -
No reaction. He's unconscious.
She tests his neck for a pulse.
Apparently he's still alive, because she raises her hand
over her head.
Her palm vertical, like a knife.
She's about to deliver a karate chop.
To his neck.

It will kill him.

- Midwest house, Mitch leaping out from Gracie's doorway -
- Mitch beating her as she crawls across the floor of
their house. (Something we didn't see before.) She reaches
up, flicks the light switch; Mitch jumps on her back -
- Mitch: ""You'll never see Gracie again.""
- Earlier: ""She's My daughter. Don't even think about
taking her.""

they will never... ever... find you."""|speech

Face contorted in rage, confusion -
She brings her hand down -
Misses. him.

presses redial.
Stares out the window. We see the turmoil on her face, hear it

1034|SLIM|"I know all that!
I have to, but I can't!
I'm not a killer!
I'm not him!
Mitch. Crazed and bloody face. In his hand: the wooden lamp.
She senses something, turns her head slightly to one side -
- so the lamp does not land quite flush on her skull.
Still sends her crashing to the floor.
Now she does not move.
He stands over her. Looks insane: bloody, dazed, beaten: but
triumphant."|speech

The lamp moving in his hand. He's rotating it. A simple
menacing image... . and we realize: he' s aoinq to hit her again.

INSTRUCTOR'S VOICE (CONT.)
You're ready...
Mitch sees the slight smile, can't believe it -
Rage.
He pulls his foot back to kick her -
Her eyes are open, just a slit -
His foot swinging forward...
As it reaches her, she grabs it, yanks it -
He's pulled off his feet, crashing down on top of her -
But she's already rolling, out from under him... and up -
Coming to her feet -
He starts to rise, all fours, then into a crouch and ug...
SLOW MOTION. She's ready. Her face alert. Center of gravity
low. Arm low,.fist low... As her motion unfurls:
Boxers say that an uppercut, perfectly
executed, is the most difficult,
powerful, and beautiful of punches.
Indeed: when an uppercut starts low for maximum center-of-
gravity and hits the opponent flush on the point of the chin -
as Slim's does here - it delivers a devastating message to the
central nervous system, short-circuiting it completely.
Mitch flies backward...
There's a table behind him.
His head cracks on the table.
His neck snaps.
He lands on the floor: twisted, broken.
Slim stares at him.
There's no way a living man could assume the position now
occupied by her former husband."|speech
1039|117|"She stares in disbelief.
Though she knows the answer, she feels his carotid artery.
Her face registers what she feels. Horror, relief.
