5||EXT. THE PLANET - MORNING|location
6|FADE IN:|"Huge mountains, destroyed STRUCTURES. Buildings
enveloped by flows of earth. Awe-inspiring beauty."|speech
7||JACK (V.O.)|unknown
8|FADE IN:|"They arrived almost half a century
ago. Aliens, Scavs, whatever you
want to call them. Their idea of
how-do-you-do was to blow up our
moon.
Giant waterfalls crash where lava cooled through iron and
concrete. Telephone polls half-buried in sand."|speech
9||JACK (V.O.)|unknown
10|FADE IN:|"Without her moon, the earth went
insane. Most were killed in the
floods, as the cities came down,
as everything caught fire. A year
later their ground troops landed,
to exterminate whoever was left.
A station wagon half protrudes from a lava flow. A
child's plastic flip-flops on the dash."|speech
11||JACK (V.0.)|unknown
12|FADE IN:|"They were probably surprised, what
we were willing to do, to survive.
We used the nukes."|speech
13|(BEAT)|"We won the war, but lost the
planet.
Low on the HORIZON, the TET rises with the sun. It's a
WHITE TETRAHEDRON (SIX-SIDED) SPACE STATION that circles
the earth once a day, like an artificial moon."|speech
14||JACK (V.0.)|unknown
15|(BEAT)|"Humanity had to flee the Earth.
We had to unlearn what it meant,
to call something our home. Now
we live on the Tet, our man-made
moon. A temporary home before the
next step. Everyone's there now."|speech

17||INT. BEDROOOM - MORNING|location
18|(BEAT)|"An ALARM chirps. A man's hand reaches out of bed,
silences it. The MAN swings his feet onto the floor. He
sits with his face in his hands, waking up. We hear a
SHOWER RUNNING. He looks up.
A WOMAN showers near him, only steamed glass walls
between them. She sees him, smiles at him, without
modesty. He looks back at her.
OVER TITLES. We watch a familiar morning routine:"|speech
19||INT. A HOME - MORNING|location
20|(BEAT)|"BATHROOM. The man flicks on a light, stares at himself
in the mirror. This is JACK. Early 40's, a good face
that enjoys rugged living. Tan and weathered skin. His
eyes are curious, kind, almost child-like.
The woman squeezes in next to him, VICTORIA. 30s, a tom-
boy shock of red hair, towel around her neck. She
brushes her teeth.
KITCHEN. Victoria watches the coffee drip, bites toast.
SHOWER. Jack lets warm water blast him in the face.
READY ROOM. Jack pulls a worn high-tech workman's suit
from a locker, revealing a photo taped to the door: It's
of him and Victoria, younger, in a white-walled high-tech
corridor, smiling eager at the camera. He stares at it
for a moment, closes the locker door.
KITCHEN. Victoria hands Jack his coffee. He kisses the
top of her head, heads out to work."|speech
21||EXT. SKY TOWER - CONTINUOUS|location
22|(BEAT)|"He walks out onto the deck of a futuristic home perched
1,200 feet in the air, literally above the clouds. As
our minds are blown, Jack moves away from the glass-
walled home towards his BUBBLESHIP, a futuristic-cross
between a Bell 47 Helicopter and a jet fighter, and we
CRANE UP UP UP... INCREDIBLE VERTIGO until we're looking
down at this impossible structure. Jack, climbing into
his ship.

cloud-cover. The BUBBLESHIP streaks through our frame,
dropping faster than free fall."|speech
25||INT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS|location
26|(BEAT)|"Through the canopy of the Bubbleship: The cloud cover
below seems to FALL UPWARDS at us, that's how fast we're
diving. There's a small worn BOBBLE-HEAD on the dash
which vibrates with the ship.
Jack is un-phased by the drop, touches a few controls.
VICTORIA (V.O.)
Good morning, Jack. I'll be your
flight attendant for the day.
This is day... three thousand two
hundred and twenty five, in case
you were wondering.
JACK is running instruments. A day at work.."|speech
27|VICTORIA|"Today we will be running support
on five Resource Gatherers working
the seaboard. Coordinates coming
to you... now. Please do confirm.
On Jack's heads-up display, five icons glow to life."|speech
28|JACK|"Yeah, I got 'em. You got 'em,
Bob?
The Bobblehead bobs."|speech
29||INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS|location
30|JACK|"VICTORIA watches the Bubbleship's icon on a screen.
She's now wearing a work jumpsuit open over a man's
undershirt. She has a natural ease with tech and stress.
She sips her coffee, punches up a feed, multi-tasking
with cool."|speech

although one went offline last
night. How's the drop?"|speech

JACK"|"Oh, you know. Same ole' same.
In front of Victoria, almost a hundred years of
technological advances. Most prominent a MAP overlaid
with environmental, meteorological, radiation levels...
Other screens stream cam-footage from the Bubbleship."|speech
34|VICTORIA|"Alright, you're blind in five,
four, three...
INTERCUT WITH JACK IN THE BUBBLESHIP. JACK watches the
cloud wall RUSH UP at him."|speech
35|VICTORIA (CONT'D)|Two... one...|speech
36|JACK|You should come with me sometime.|speech
37|VICTORIA|"No, thank you. Have a nice ride.
The Bubbleship HITS CLOUDS, goes completely blind. Just
vapor and water HAMMERING the canopy like bullets.
On the heads-up display, GPS numbers roll. The readouts
deal with climate, terrain below... Even in this hell,
Jack takes the controls, starts to pilot on instruments.
One of Victoria's boards flashes. She squints as a large
MASS forms near Jack's ship."|speech
38|VICTORIA (CONT'D)|"Jack, you got some weather on your
five, closing.
The Bubbleship is VIBRATING, buffeted."|speech
39|JACK|"What do you call this?
What does a storm look like inside a storm? Like this.
The WALL OF WEATHER comes out of the wind and rain from
behind Jack's ship, simply eats it up.
Suddenly Jack's going end over end, helpless. Warning
lights flash. Jack punches controls that won't respond."|speech

44|"JACK (CONT'D)
(STILL SINGING)"|"""I guess you'd say... What can
make me feel this way?""
(a little tense)
Okay, Bob. Need you to work with
me here.
In the Bubbleship, Jack works the display, literally
SMACKS a panel with his fist. Suddenly, the Bubbleship
SURGES with power. Jack regains control as:
INT/EXT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS
The Bubbleship BURSTS through low clouds, hurtling down
past turbulence into...
THE SKY ABOVE A BEAUTIFUL DESOLATE PLANET. Mysterious
black sand dunes, active volcanoes, swirling orange and
gold sediment, steaming bright blue hot springs and rich
brown craters.
Jack takes a moment to marvel at it all."|speech
45|JACK|"(under his breath)
""Talkin' 'bout my girl...""
Jack shifts the Bubbleship, in the distance a series of
RESOURCE-GATHERERS on the horizon. Essentially titanic
vacuums, sucking up the oceans.
In front of her console, VICTORIA charts the Gatherers,
and the patrol arcs of their defensive Drones. One
blinks, stalled."|speech
46|VICTORIA|"Okay, we've got another Drone
downed last night."|speech
47|JACK|"Send it.
NUMBERS FIRE across the heads-up. Jack touches a button.
A BAR GAUGE begins to fill, like a street racer turning
on the NOX before dragging..."|speech

49|"CONTINUED:
VICTORIA"|"Would you like to set a course to
reserve fuel?"|speech
50|"JACK
(SMALL SMILE)"|"Absolutely not.
Bar gaucre hits top. Jack punches it.
JACK vibrates in his seat, pinned back. The ship SCREAMS
over the surface, following the signal.
Now A HUGE CRATER opens up in front of him which he DROPS
INTO, barely missing an edge... which seems to have
architecture to it.
The ship skims close along the walls which are revealed
to be rows and rows of stadium seats, half buried in
sand. We're in Giants Stadium, New Jersey.
Old news to Jack. He surveys below..."|speech
51|JACK (CONT'D)|"I see it, looks like full mid-
flight impact. What was its last
destination?
BELOW, through blowing dust, we see a DRONE, a spherical
mechanical weapon, plunged into the sand."|speech
52|VICTORIA|"Yo no se. No data. It's not
transmitting.
(checking the map)
Tet coverage will go live in 11
minutes."|speech

55|JACK|"You know, I actually read about
this game. Giants are literally
on their own seven with 25 seconds
on the clock..."|speech

eyes in the sky for another ten
minutes. Do not land.
SEEN FROM INSIDE A STADIUM TUNNEL: The bubbleship lands
thirty yards from the Drone, moors itself by setting
spikes from its skids. Blowing sand whips around both."|speech
60||INT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS|location
61|CONTINUED: ( 2)|"JACK grabs an old YANKEES CAP from between the seats and
slides it on backwards. He hoists a WEAPON, a carbine-
sized gun on a sling, and checks its charge as he slides
the door open. He's BLASTED with sand and wind which now
suddenly still, like a freight train that's passed."|speech
62|JACK|"Anyway... QB lets off this mile-
high bomb...
The weather's fast and erratic like this. As Jack starts
moving towards the Drone, a heavy mist forms, shrouding
it in grey. There's almost no sound, just Jack's feet on
earth..."|speech
63|JACK (CONT'D)|"The thing just sails the length of
the field.
Victoria anxiously checks a screen, the arc of the Tet's
""vision"" still not covering Jack's location."|speech
64|VICTORIA|"Jack I have no scope. The Tet is
still offline.
He pauses. A faint sound on the wind... like a whine."|speech

interception. Devastation. It's
all over."|speech
66||EXT. STADIUM - CONTINUOUS|location

reaches the downed drone."|speech

69|CONTINUED:|"THE DRONE, a spectacular piece of technology, has landed
hard, half-buried in the sand. The basic electronics are
still humming, cycling."|speech
70|JACK|"But the guy's too eager. He
starts running it back.
Everyone's yelling ""Fall down,
just fall down!""
Jack goes to his knees, examining it, his hands expertly
locate an empty tube-like space on the side of the Drone."|speech
71||JACK (CONT'D)|location
72|JACK|"Huh... The fuel-cell has been
taken."|speech
73|VICTORIA|"What do you mean taken? Was it a
malfunction?
Jack looks at the casing... beaten, pried open? He
glances at the ground around him, the dark tunnels.
REVERSE ANGLE. From inside a caved-in tunnel entrance,
Jack looks small, vulnerable. Something watches Jack..."|speech
74|JACK|"No... It's a master drone, too.
166. Looks like it was hit mid
flight, managed to limp its way
here. Watch my back, I'm starting
field repair.
INTERCUT: VICTORIA AT SKY TOWER. Glances at the arc of
the Tet's vision - still six minutes away."|speech
75||JACK (CONT'D)|location
76|JACK|"Bob, I'm going to need a cell.
AT THE BUBBLESHIP. An exterior compartment opens
revealing spare parts, etc... At the same time, a small
ROVER, an ball-shaped independent gopher, rolls free from
the ship, sprouting wheels..."|speech
77|VICTORIA|"Jack, you need to get out of
there. Bring it home to the shop.
Jack has a panel open. He pulls a lead from the sleeve
of his suit, connects it to a board. We see FLIGHT DATA
transfer to the Bubbleship."|speech

recover, start running it back.
Total insanity."|speech
83|VICTORIA|"I'm reading the whole central core
off alignment, you don't have the
necessary tools.
Jack's got an arm and half his chest inside. He takes
his CHEWING GUM, presses it in next to a board...
Systems go green on Victoria's console."|speech
84|VICTORIA (CONT'D)|Hold on, what did you just do?|speech
85|JACK|"(calling to the ship)
Bob, I said I needed...
He turns to find that the ROVER is already there, a
DEUTERIUM FUEL CELL sitting in its payload bay.
A SOUND now reaches Jack. Distant, an animal in pain?
Jack listens, but it's gone. He slots the cell. A
HUMMMM as the Drone powers up, systems coming online.
Jack looks around at the stadium."|speech
86|JACK (CONT'D)|"Can you imagine it? 80,000 people
on their feet. Everyone yelling
""Go! Go! Go!..."" Touchdown...
He sets his gun against the Drone, raises his arms,

the depths. The sound is clear now, a low WHIMPERING.
Jack makes his way down the tunnel, carefully. Ahead,
the tunnel meets the circular tunnel that rings the
stadium. His light plays over the silty floor, finds:
A DOG. Starving, shivering. It COWERS in a corner."|speech
92|JACK|"Hey there, boy. Easy...
Jack moves forward, hand out."|speech
93|JACK (CONT'D)|"You got nothing to be scared of,
buddy...
The dog suddenly SCURRIES away into the dark

TEETH... and Jack hears ITS HEAVY LABORED BREATH..."|speech
94|JACK (CONT'D)|"Ah, shi...
JACK SPRINTS, full speed! The animal, A GIANT EMACIATED
HAIRLESS BEAR, comes SURGING out of the darkness,
lumbering after him.
Jack TEARS back down the tunnel, the bear's form almost

He REACHES, flips the Drone's fuel cell door shut.
Drone 166 REACTIVATES. It SURGES UP, weapons POWERING UP
and RRRRRRRRRRRRip!! It opens up with white plasma fire
on the bear which seems to go nova in mid air,
disintegrating to BLACK ASH which covers Jack.
Jack stumbles to his feet. Drone 166 NOW WHEELS ON HIM."|speech

hard, hating this moment. With its ganglia still hanging
out, it doesn't seem to be processing... And then just as
quickly, the Drone rockets up into the sky and is gone.
Jack falls to his knees in the sand, exhausted. Only now
realizing that Victoria has been calling his name."|speech
102|VICTORIA|"Jesus, Jack. What the hell was
that?
INTERCUT VICTORIA. The Tet's scanners finally giving her
a high-rez thermal view of Jack. Her display burning red
from the residual plasma fire."|speech

ON JACK. The captured Drone data right there in front of
him on the heads-up. He's too curious."|speech

one we lost last night."|speech
113||EXT. HILLSIDE -- LATER|location
114|JACK (CONT'D)|"JACK'S BUBBLESHIP, locked and armed, sits atop a ridge,
against the bruised and lightning-fractured sky.
Jack SCANS the horizon with his BINOCS, past deserted
landscape, an early iron-framed skyscraper that came down
semi-intact on its side. Nothing.
He lowers the Binocs, glances upwards to where one of the
HUGE RESOURCE GATHERERS blots out half the sky, breath-
taking. It's hovering over what is left of a subsided
harbor, a few blasted and rusted hulks of ships. The
water level has dropped by a kilometer."|speech

He stares at the HUGE columns of water draining upwards."|speech
120|JACK (CONT'D)|Do we have to take it all?|speech
121|VICTORIA|"It's not doing anyone any good
here.
JACK nods, starts to turn away when something GLINTS on
the horizon. He raises the Binocs, PANS to a gallows-
like structure. He ZOOMS, but it is still unclear."|speech
122|VICTORIA (CONT'D)|"Jack, without a signal, you're
looking for a needle in a
haystack. I think we've had
enough excitement for one day.
JACK is at the back of the Bubbleship, throwing levers."|speech
123|JACK|"Actually I've got a bit of a
problem with a gyro here, call you
when I've fixed it.
He releases a catch, pulls a WHITE RECTANGULAR CASE from
a slot in the Bubbleship. He kneels down, hands working
expertly, producing a full UNFOLDING MOTORCYCLE.
As Jack locks the rear wheel in place, the bike HUMMS to
life. He gets on and opens up the throttle, rooster-
tailing off. The bike's electric, but it MOVES."|speech

onto rocks, stretching over... a COLLAPSED SECTION OF
EARTH. This was the source of the light reflection.
Jack stares down into the hole... black. He POPS a
flare, drops it in. It comes to rest far below, next to
the unmistakable form of a DRONE."|speech
128|JACK|".There you are.
An instant of BLACK...
And we're suddenly looking at Jack THROUGH ALIEN
BINOCULARS. High tech, symbol readouts changing.
Something is watching him."|speech
129||INT. SINK HOLE - DAY|location
130|JACK|"Inside the hole, looking up. A CLIMBING ROPE spills

array blazes on, illuminating the walls passing by."|speech
131||INT. LIBRARY -- DAY|location
132|JACK|"Jack drops down through what used to be a roof... into
the READING ROOM OF THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY. Vast,
ruined, the far end totally collapsed, like a sky-scraper
fell on it. He reaches the silty floor, the flare's
burning light illuminating the room.
He STARES at the expanse of SHELVES that line the walls,
stripped and empty. Wonder... and disappointment.
He turns to his task, kneels by the Drone. The thing's a
wreck. A METAL SHAFT protrudes from a crease. Jack
marvels at the accuracy of the shot...
He carefully reaches out, slides the fuel cell door open.
Again, the FUEL CELL is missing."|speech

He raises the flare off the ground, illuminating a void
where the entire floor has imploded down seven more
stories. What's left is a PIT, with a building-sized ton
of twisted metal hanging over it...
A single bent GIRDER still spans the hole. Jack tracks
the possibilities... steps out onto the girder. He
reaches up to the suspended wreckage to balance...
IT SHIFTS! A hundred tons of twisted metal just moved an
inch above him. Best leave that alone...
He balances, inching across this metal tightrope.
Finally reaching the other side...
AT THE FAR SHELVES
Jack approaches the wall of books, hundred of them. He
kneels, lifts one, blows dust off the cover: ""THE
EDUCATION OF HENRY ADAMS.""
He steps back, admiring it... SNAP! A BEAR TRAP hidden
in the debris closes around his leg, piercing armor and
flesh. Jack has a second to process and a cable rises
from the debris, goes taught!
JACK is dragged through the dust inhumanly FAST, headed
towards a darkened alcove. He activates a LASER CUTTER
on his cuff, slices through the cable which WHIPS AWAY as
he brings his rifle up, FIRES rounds into the darkness.
INHUMAN SCREAMS. Half animal, half electronic.
Something's in pain, but not retreating, CLOSING ON HIM.
Jack SLICES DOWN, cutting loose the claw, and RUNS FOR IT
back towards the HOLE as his girder is yanked away in
front of him, pulled into the void below.
Jack doesn't slow, reaches the edge, LEAPS!
A moment, Jack hanging in space, gravity clawing at him,
falling... SLAMMING into the far side. For a moment
dangling over the fall, then Jack hauls himself over the
far side.
ALIEN FORMS emerge from recesses. We get glimpses of
feathers, oily flesh, metal... They CLOSE as he reaches
his line, clips in and RISES automatically, the suit

Jack has a second to feel the slack hit. And then he's
FALLING... IMPACTS the ground. Can't get his air.
Staggering wildly to his feet, FORMS CLOSING...
Suddenly a DRONE blasts down through the ceiling hole.
Its lights turning night to day, its cannons FIRING.
In the STROBING FLASH of canon fire, we see SCAVS
INCINERATED. Metal and hair fry to ASH as the insect-
like creatures SCREAM!! Other shots IMPACT WALLS. Fire
and plaster dust fills the space.
Jack shields himself from the debris as the Drone ceases
firing, WHIRLS on Jack. The same awful moment as it
SCANS him.
Then it lifts away, is gone as quickly as it arrived.
And with its departure, the darkness comes again.
Silence, whatever was here is now gone.
Jack takes in the destruction for a hard beat: The ash
