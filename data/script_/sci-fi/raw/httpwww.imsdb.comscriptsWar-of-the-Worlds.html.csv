[Showing Pictures of City Life]"|stage direction
2|NARRATOR|"No one would have believed in the early
years of the21st century, that our world
was being watched by intelligences greater
than our own. That as men busied themselves
about their various concerns, they observed
and studied. Like the way a man with
a microscope might scrutinize the creatures
that swarm and multiply in a drop of
water. With infinite complacency men
went to and fro about the globe, confident
of our empire over this world. Yet,
across the gulf of space, intellects,
vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded
our plant with envious eyes. And slowly
and surely, drew their plans against
us."|speech
