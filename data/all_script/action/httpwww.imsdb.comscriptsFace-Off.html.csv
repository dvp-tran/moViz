fortune goes around until we PULL BACK to reveal:
JON ARCHER (30) rising winged Pegasus.  On the adjacent
unicorn is his son MATTHEW (5).  Clutching a balloon,
Matty waves at his dad.  A happy moment, like so many
certain to follow -- until we realize we are watching
them THROUGH...
SNIPER'S RIFLE SCOPE - SNIPER'S EYES
wait until the child clears his aim -- Archer is the
target.  They round the bend and disappear...
MATTHEW
Loses his grip on the unicorn.  Archer reaches over and
pulls him into his lap.  They happily ride together...
As the horses sweep back INTO VIEW... exposing Archer...
Now we see the sniper.  CASTOR TROY is cool, efficient,
aggressive, sexual.  His finger closes around the
trigger.
BOOM!  A BULLET RIPS into Archer's back.  Bleeding... he
drops off his horse... and sinks to the deck of the
carousel.  His eyes desperately searching... searching...
searching... until he sees --
Matthew lies on his back -- still.  Slowly, Archer
reaches out and takes Matthew's hand... and now we see
COLOR for the first time...
Blood red... as bleeding father touches bleeding son...
TILT UP TO the winged Pegasus flying by -- now in full
color and UP UP UP TO Matthew's red balloon... floating
away.
HANDEL'S MESSIAH OVER a SERIES OF SHOTS:
FBI BRIEFING ROOM
Gazing out the window as dawn breaks over the city below
is Jon Archer... older... unshaven... fatigued... his
eyes reveal a man in the grip of obsession.
CAROUSEL HORSE
sweeps by, as if marking time itself...
HOLY PLACE
Smoky, spiritual... dominated by a gleaming, golden
cross.  A priest kneels before it -- deep in prayer.  The
glimmering cross comes INTO FOCUS... but it's just a
light-reflection... off the casing of a large bomb.  This
is no chapel... but an atrium.  Somewhere.
And as the ""priest"" rubs out his cigarette we see it's
Castor Troy -- carefully installing this complex device.

COLLISION COURSE
as two hunks of metal bear down.  The machines are
seconds apart when --
Archer looks up to see...
Winters' face pressed up against the cockpit window,
Castor holding a gun to her head.
Archer cuts the wheel -- just avoiding the jet.  The
Hummer skids to a stop as Federal back-up arrives -- but
too late.  Archer watches an FBI chopper -- landing in a
swirl of dust.
As the jet picks up speed... the hatch opens.  Castor
blasts Winters in the side and tosses her onto the

Castor smiles at Pollux, sensing freedom, until...
KA-CHUNK:  Something POUNDS the jet -- from above.
Castor leans out the hatch and sees...
The chopper on top of them -- Archer at the controls.
Eye-contact -- years of hatred pass between these men.
Castor BLASTS at him from the open hatch.
The chopper's left windscreen spiderwebs.  Archer jerks
and weaves -- dodging the BULLETS.  The chopper pulls
away.
The jet finally lifts off... when...
The chopper settles on the jet -- slamming at its tail.

Tito reacts to this madness -- as the chopper plays a
deadly game of leap-frog with the jet.

Castor catches him before he hits the floor --
simultaneously BLASTING the sharpshooter.
Castor drags Pollux back into the smoke-filled hangar.
Archer arrives and quickly checks the dead agents, his
anger building.  He signals Tito and the others to spread
out.
DEEP IN HANGAR
A maze of airplane debris and heavy machinery.  Led by
Archer, the FBI agents pick their way through it.
ROOKIE LOOMIS snaps alert -- did he see something?
Advancing carefully, he comes up on...
Castor -- staunching Pollux's shoulder wound.  Pollux
sees the agent -- and FIRES.
Loomis hits the floor -- his bleeding ear is shredded.
Suddenly a forklift charges down on Castor and Pollux.
Tito is at the wheel.  Castor FIRES -- forcing Tito to
dive off.  The forklift careens on -- driving apart the
brothers.
The forklift upends a stack of heavy crates -- pinning
Pollux.  Castor tries to free his trapped brother."|stage direction

MUSIC as Archer and Castor begin their cat-and-mouse
dance.
Sensing Archer, Castor pauses by an old landing gear.  He
draws a fresh pistol from his ankle holster and moves on.
Archer pauses at the landing gear... his own stealthy
movements mirroring Castor's.
Castor waits behind a stack of steel drums... his gaze
trying to penetrate the darkness... He SNAPS his fingers.
The sound ECHOES as he tries to draw Archer in.
Archer reacts to the sound and SNAPS back -- answering
the challenge.  As the deadly beat between them
continues --
BLAM BLAM BLAM!  Archer spins away just as Castor OPENS
FIRE from the gloom... one step ahead.

his enemy out.  Silence -- then Archer senses...
Castor is behind him.  He FIRES -- Archer dives away.
The BARRAGE CONTINUES -- driving Archer back between two
huge turbine engines.  As Archer reloads, he stares at
the control panel switches.
Castor moves in for the kill when he hears a final SNAP-
SNAP.  Except it isn't a finger snap... it's two
switches.
VRRRROOOM!  The TWIN ENGINES ROAR on!  Unable to fight
