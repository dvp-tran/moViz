the oldest man on the craft.  Relaxed, battle-hardened,
powerful, ignoring the hell around them.  He smiles, puts a
cigar in his mouth, strikes a match on the front of DeLancey's
helmet and lights the cigar.
DeLancey tries to look away but Miller grips him by the jaw
and forces him to lock eyes.  Miller smiles.  DeLancey is
terrified.
Delancey Captain, are we all gonna die?
Miller Hell no, two-thirds, tops.
Delancey Oh, Jesus...
Miller I want every one of you to look at the man on your
left.  Now look at the man on your right.  Feel sorry for
those to sons-of-bitches, they're going to get it, you're
not going to get a scratch.  A few, including DeLancey, manage
thin smiles.  Miller releases his grip on DeLancey who moves
his jaw as if to see if it's broken.  Miller pats him on the
cheek and moves on to the bow."|stage direction
14|MILLER|"Looks over the gunwale at THE HELL
IN FRONT OF THEM."|speech
15||"PAN DOWN TO MILLER'S HAND
It quivers in fear.  Miller glances around, sees that none

belongs to someone else.  It stops shaking.  He turns his
eyes back to the objective.

TO DRAW THE GERMAN FIRE.
THE GERMAN MACHINE GUNNER

Jackson opens a two-foot tripod with a flick of his wrist,

she never lost.  She could read those
cocky bastards like they were playing
open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had
sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her
eyes, the tone of her voice, her
bets, her jokes, the way she sipped
her coffee, she was a master.  She
won more money on shit hands than
anyone in the history of the game.
Every Saturday night, my father would
lose two, three hundred bucks and
she'd win it all back and then some.

me apart when I'd get one of my men
killed, but what was I supposed to
do?  Break down in front of the ones
who were standing there waiting for
me to tell them what to do?  Of course
not, so I bluffed, and after a while,
I started to fall for my own bluff.

much easier.  Sarge Is that why your
hand's been shaking?"|speech

you you can have all the firepower
in the world and if your men don't
have good morale, it's not worth a
damn.  So if you're scared or empty

do you tell your men?  Of course
not.  You bluff, you lie."|speech

kill one of your men, you tell
yourself you just saved the lives of
two, three, ten, a hundred others.
We lost, what, thirty-one on the
cliffs?  I'll bet we saved ten times
that number by putting out those
guns.  That's over three hundred
men.  Maybe five hundred.  A thousand.
