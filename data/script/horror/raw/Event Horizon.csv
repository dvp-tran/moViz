ascetic, etched face. Many years a scientist.

Decorated by a woman, but Weir is alone, unless you count
photographs. His nightstand looks like a shrine to a beautiful
woman.
Weir reaches to the stand. Picks up...

smile.
Weir lies back on the bed. Looks at the photo. Presses it to

back."|speech

into New York harbor, I'd find it
more plausible."|speech

a search and rescue team, investigate
the source of the transmission. If
it really is the Event Horizon,

briefing on the ship's systems for
the salvage crew..."|speech

54|LYLE|"Dr. Weir, you have no experience
with salvage procedures."|speech
55|WEIR|"I designed the ship's propulsion
system. I am the only person capable
of evaluating the performance of the
gravity drive. You can't send a Search
and Rescue team out there alone and
expect them to succeed. That would
be like... like sending an auto-
mechanic to work on the shuttle."|speech

your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it
doesn't factor into this."|speech

Alone, each sound would raise the hair on your neck. Together,
they are unbearable.

Weir sits there, stunned."|stage direction

there's been no further contact.
Just the beacon, every two minutes."|speech

you have to put me on that ship."|speech

but I'll run this by the Man
downstairs. You'll know my decision
by the end of the day."|speech
73|WEIR|Thank you.|speech
74|HOLLIS|"Don't thank me, Bill. I'm not doing
you any favors."|speech
75||Weir leaves. The door closes behind him.|stage direction
76|LYLE|"You're not seriously considering
sending him?"|speech
77|HOLLIS|"You don't just dismiss Bill Weir.
The man held Oppenheimer's chair at
Princeton. If the Event Horizon had
worked, he would have gone down in
history as the greatest mind in
physics since Einstein."|speech
78|LYLE|"The official inquiry blamed Weir's
design for the ship's loss."|speech
79|HOLLIS|"That doesn't mean a damn thing. They
were looking for a scapegoat and
Weir fit the bill. But he's not
responsible for what happened to the
ship."|speech
80|LYLE|Does he know that?|speech
81|HOLLIS|What's on your mind?|speech
82|LYLE|"He doesn't belong on this mission.
Responsible or not, he blames himself.
He's too close to it."|speech
