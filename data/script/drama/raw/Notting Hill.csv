29|WILLIAM|Spike!|speech
30||"The house has far too many things in it.  Definitely two-
bachelor flat.
Spike appears.  An unusual looking fellow.  He has unusual
hair, unusual facial hair and an unusual Welsh accent: very
white, as though his flesh has never seen the sun.  He wears
only shorts."|stage direction
31|SPIKE|"Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me
with an incredibly important
decision, could you?"|speech
32|WILLIAM|"This is important in comparison to,
let's say, whether they should
cancel third world debt?"|speech
33|SPIKE|"That's right -- I'm at last going out
on a date with the great Janine and I
just want to be sure I've picked the
right t-shirt."|speech

35|SPIKE|Well... wait for it...|speech
36||(He pulls on a t-shirt)|location

38||"The t-shirt is white with a horrible looking plastic alien
coming out of it, jaws open, blood everywhere.  It says 'I Love
Blood.'"|stage direction
39|WILLIAM|"Yes -- might make it hard to strike a
really romantic note."|speech
40|SPIKE|Point taken.|speech
41||He heads back up the stairs... talks as he changes...|stage direction
42|SPIKE|I suspect you'll prefer the next one.|speech

pointing down to his flies, saying, 'Get It Here.'"|stage direction
44|SPIKE|Cool, huh?|speech
45|WILLIAM|"Yes -- she might think you don't have
true love on your mind."|speech

most beautiful woman in the world.'"|stage direction

done."|speech

55|WILLIAM (V.O.)|"And so it was just another hopeless
Wednesday, as I set off through the
market to work, little suspecting
that this was the day which would
change my life forever.  This is
work, by the way, my little travel
book shop..."|speech
56||A small unpretentious store... named 'The Travel Book Co.'|stage direction
57|WILLIAM (V.O.)|"... which, well, sells travel books
-- and, to be frank with you, doesn't
always sell many of those."|speech
58||William enters.|stage direction
59||INT. THE BOOKSHOP - DAY|location
60||"It is a small shop, slightly chaotic, bookshelves everywhere,
with little secret bits round corners with even more books.
Martin, William's sole employee, is waiting enthusiastically.
He is very keen, an uncrushable optimist.  Perhaps without
cause.  A few seconds later, William stands gloomily behind the
desk."|stage direction
61|WILLIAM|"Classic.  Absolutely classic.
Profit from major sales push -- minus
$B!r(J347."|speech
62|MARTIN|"Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the
pain."|speech
63|WILLIAM|"Yes, better get me a half.  All I can
afford."|speech
64|MARIN|I get your logic.  Demi-capu coming up.|speech
65||"He salutes and bolts out the door -- as he does, a woman walks in.
We only just glimpse her.
Cut to William working.  He looks up casually.  And sees
something.  His reaction is hard to read.  After a pause..."|stage direction
66|WILLIAM|Can I help you?|speech
67||"It is Anna Scott, the biggest movie star in the world -- here --
in his shop.  The most divine, subtle, beautiful woman on earth.
When she speaks she is very self-assured and self-contained."|stage direction
68|ANNA|No, thanks.  I'll just look around.|speech
69|WILLIAM|Fine.|speech
70||"She wanders over to a shelf as he watches her -- and picks out a
quite smart coffee table book."|stage direction
71|WILLIAM|"That book's really not good -- just
in case, you know, browsing turned to
buying.  You'd be wasting your money."|speech
72|ANNA|Really?|speech
73|WILLIAM|"Yes.  This one though is... very
good."|speech
74||He picks up a book on the counter.|stage direction
75|WILLIAM|"I think the man who wrote it has
actually been to Turkey, which helps.
There's also a very amusing incident
with a kebab."|speech
76|ANNA|Thanks.  I'll think about it.|speech
77||"William suddenly spies something odd on the small TV monitor
beside him."|stage direction
78|WILLIAM|If you could just give me a second.|speech
79||"Her eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and
approaches a man in slightly ill-fitting clothes."|stage direction
80|WILLIAM|Excuse me.|speech
81|THIEF|Yes.|speech
82|WILLIAM|Bad news.|speech
83|THIEF|What?|speech
84|WILLIAM|"We've got a security camera in this
bit of the shop."|speech
85|THIEF|So?|speech
86|WILLIAM|"So, I saw you put that book down your
trousers."|speech
87|THIEF|What book?|speech
88|WILLIAM|The one down your trousers.|speech
89|THIEF|I haven't got a book down my trousers.|speech
90|WILLIAM|"Right -- well, then we have something
of an impasse.  I tell you what --
I'll call the police -- and,  what can
I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole
book-down-the-trousers scenario, I
really apologize."|speech
91|THIEF|"Okay -- what if I did have a book down
my trousers?"|speech
92|WILLIAM|"Well, ideally, when I went back to
the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan
guide to Bali from your trousers, and
either wipe it and put it back, or
buy it.  See you in a sec."|speech
93||"He returns to his desk.  In the monitor we just glimpse, as does
William, the book coming out of the trousers and put back on the
shelves.  The thief drifts out towards the door.  Anna, who has
observed all this, is looking at a blue book on the counter."|stage direction
94|WILLIAM|Sorry about that...|speech
95|ANNA|"No, that's fine.  I was going to
steal one myself but now I've changed
my mind.  Signed by the author, I see."|speech
96|WILLIAM|"Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you
can find an unsigned copy, it's
worth an absolute fortune."|speech
97||She smiles.  Suddenly the thief is there.|stage direction
98|THIEF|Excuse me.|speech
99|ANNA|Yes.|speech
100|THIEF|Can I have your autograph?|speech
101|ANNA|What's your name?|speech
102|THIEF|Rufus.|speech
103||She signs his scruffy piece of paper.  He tries to read it.|stage direction
104|THIEF|What does it say?|speech
105|ANNA|"Well, that's the signature -- and
above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you
belong in jail.'"|speech
106|THIEF|"Nice one.  Would you like my phone
number?"|speech
107|ANNA|Tempting but... no, thank you.|speech
108||Thief leaves.|stage direction
109|ANNA|I think I will try this one.|speech
110||"She hands William a $B!r(J20 note and the book he said was rubbish.
He talks as he handles the transaction."|stage direction
111|WILLIAM|"Oh -- right -- on second thoughts
maybe it wasn't that bad.  Actually
-- it's a sort of masterpiece really.
None of those childish kebab
stories you get in so many travel
books these days.  And I'll throw in
one of these for free."|speech
112||He drops in one of the signed books.|stage direction
113|WILLIAM|"Very useful for lighting fires,
wrapping fish, that sort of things."|speech
114||She looks at him with a slight smile.|stage direction
115|ANNA|Thanks.|speech
116||"And leaves.  She's out of his life forever.  William is a little
dazed.  Seconds later Martin comes back in."|stage direction
117|MARTIN|Cappuccino as ordered.|speech
118|WILLIAM|"Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe
who was just in here."|speech
119|MARTIN|Who?  Someone famous?|speech
120||But William's innate natural English discretion takes over.|stage direction
121|WILLIAM|No. No-one -- no-one.|speech
122||They set about drinking their coffees.|stage direction
123|MARTIN|"Would be exciting if someone famous
did come into the shop though,
wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is
pretty incredible actually -- I once
saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think
it was Ringo.  It might have been
that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,'
Toppy."|speech
124|WILLIAM|Topol.|speech
125|MARTIN|That's right -- Topol.|speech
126|WILLIAM|"But Ringo Starr doesn't look
anything like Topol."|speech
127|MARTIN|"No, well... he was quite a long way
away."|speech
128|WILLIAM|So it could have been neither of them?|speech
129|MARTIN|I suppose so.|speech
130|WILLIAM|"Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes,
is it?"|speech
131|MARTIN|Not classic, no.|speech
132||Martin shakes his head.  William drains his cappuccino.|stage direction
133|WILLIAM|Right -- want another one?|speech
134|MARTIN|"Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy --
I'll have an orange juice."|speech

Road."|stage direction
139||EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY|location
140||"William swings out of the little shop -- he turns the corner of
Portobello Road and bumps straight into Anna.  The orange
juice,  in its foam cup, flies.  It soaks Anna."|stage direction
141|ANNA|Oh Jesus.|speech
142|WILLIAM|Here, let me help.|speech
143||"He grabs some paper napkins and starts to clean it off -- getting
far too near her breasts in the panic of it..."|stage direction
144|ANNA|What are you doing?!|speech
145||He jumps back.|stage direction
146|WILLIAM|"Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just
over the street -- you could get
cleaned up."|speech
147|ANNA|"No thank you.  I need to get my car
back."|speech
148|WILLIAM|"I also have a phone.  I'm confident
that in five minutes we can have you
spick and span and back on the street
again... in the non-prostitute sense
obviously."|speech
149||"In his diffident way, he is confident, despite her being
genuinely annoyed.  She turns and looks at him."|stage direction
150|ANNA|"Okay.  So what does 'just over the
street' mean -- give it to me in yards."|speech
151|WILLIAM|"Eighteen yards.  That's my house
there."|speech
152||"He doesn't lie -- it is eighteen yards away.  She looks down.
She looks up at him."|stage direction
153||INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAY|location
154||They enter.  She carries a few stylish bags.|stage direction
155|WILLIAM|Come on in.  I'll just...|speech
156||"William runs in further -- it's a mess.  He kicks some old shoes
under the stairs, bins an unfinished pizza and hides a plate of
breakfast in a cupboard.  She enters the kitchen."|stage direction
157|WILLIAM|It's not that tidy, I fear.|speech
158||"And he guides her up the stairs, after taking the bag of books
from her..."|stage direction
159|WILLIAM|"The bathroom is right at the top of
the stairs and there's a phone on the
desk up there."|speech
160||She heads upstairs.|stage direction
161||INT. KITCHEN - DAY|location
162||"William is tidying up frantically.  Then he hears Anna's feet on
the stairs.  She walks down, wearing a short, sparkling black
top beneath her leather jacket.  With her trainers still on.  He
is dazzled by the sight of her."|stage direction
163|WILLIAM|"Would you like a cup of tea before
you go?"|speech
164|ANNA|No thanks.|speech
165|WILLIAM|Coffee?|speech
166|ANNA|No.|speech
167|WILLIAM|Orange juice -- probably not.|speech
168||He moves to his very empty fridge -- and offers its only contents.|stage direction
169|WILLIAM|"Something else cold -- coke, water,
some disgusting sugary drink
pretending to have something to do
with fruits of the forest?"|speech
170|ANNA|Really, no.|speech
171|WILLIAM|"Would you like something to nibble --
apricots, soaked in honey -- quite
why, no one knows -- because it stops
them tasting of apricots, and makes
them taste like honey, and if you
wanted honey, you'd just buy honey,
instead of apricots, but nevertheless
-- there we go -- yours if you want
them."|speech
172|ANNA|No.|speech
173|WILLIAM|Do you always say 'no' to everything?|speech
174||Pause.  She looks at him deep.|stage direction
175|ANNA|No.|speech
176||(pause)|location
177|ANNA|"I better be going.  Thanks for your
help."|speech
178|WILLIAM|"You're welcome and, may I also say...
heavenly."|speech
179||"It has taken a lot to get this out loud.  He is not a smooth-
talking man."|stage direction
180|WILLIAM|"Take my one chance to say it.  After
you've read that terrible book,
you're certainly not going to be
coming back to the shop."|speech
181||She smiles.  She's cool.|stage direction
182|ANNA|Thank you.|speech
183|WILLIAM|Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.|speech
184||He guides her towards the door.|stage direction
185|WILLIAM|Nice to meet you.  Surreal but nice.|speech
186||"In a slightly awkward moment, he shows her out the door.  He
closes the door and shakes his head in wonder.  Then..."|stage direction
187|WILLIAM|"'Surreal but nice.'  What was I
thinking?"|speech
188||"... He  shakes his head again in horror and wanders back along
the corridor in silence.  There's a knock on the door.  He moves
back, casually..."|stage direction
189|WILLIAM|Coming.|speech
190||He opens the door.  It's her.|stage direction
191|WILLIAM|Oh hi.  Forget something?|speech
192|ANNA|I forgot my bag.|speech
193|WILLIAM|Oh right.|speech
194||"He shoots into the kitchen and picks up the forgotten shopping
bag.  Then returns and hands it to her."|stage direction
195|WILLIAM|Here we go.|speech
196|ANNA|Thanks.  Well...|speech
197||"They stand in that corridor -- in that small space.  Second time
saying goodbye.  A strange feeling of intimacy.  She leans
forward and she kisses him.  Total silence.  A real sense of the
strangeness of those lips, those famous lips on his.  They part."|stage direction
198|WILLIAM|"I apologize for the 'surreal but nice'
comment.  Disaster..."|speech
199|ANNA|"Don't worry about it.  I thought the
apricot and honey business was the
real lowpoint."|speech
200||Suddenly there is a clicking of a key in the lock.|stage direction
201|WILLIAM|"Oh my God.  My flatmate.  I'm sorry --
there's no excuse for him."|speech

207|SPIKE|"I'm just going to go into the kitchen
to get some food -- and then I'm going
to tell you a story that will make your
balls shrink to the size of raisins."|speech
208||And leaves them in the corridor.|stage direction
209|ANNA|"Probably best not tell anyone about
this."|speech
210|WILLIAM|"Right.  No one.  I mean, I'll tell
myself sometimes but... don't worry
-- I won't believe it."|speech
211|ANNA|Bye.|speech
212||"And she leaves, with just a touch of William's hand.  Spike
comes out of the kitchen, eating something white out of a
styrofoam container with a spoon."|stage direction
213|SPIKE|"There's something wrong with this
yogurt."|speech

No clean clothes..."|speech

she said, call me at the Ritz -- and

different name."|speech

nineteen, which means basically I've
been hungry for a decade.  I've had a

costume and the third assistant who has collected her.
She walks a few yards, and then casually turns her head.  And
sees him.  Her face registers not jut surprise, certainly not a
simple smile.  His being there is a complicated thing.
Cut back to him.  He does a small wave.  She pauses as the whole
paraphernalia of the upcoming scene passes between them.  The
movie divides them.  But then she begins to walk through it, and
followed by her cluster, she makes her way towards him.  When

1532||"Anna and William at their wedding -- they kiss and walk into the
crowd.
Honey, a bridesmaid in peach satin -- she is surrounded by at
least four other bridesmaids, all under five.
Nearby, Tony standing, glowing, beside his fabulous,
pyramidical wedding cake.
William's mother is not quite happy with how he's looking.  She
tries to brush his hair.
Max, dressed in the most devastating Bond-like white tuxedo is
dancing with Anna -- thrilled.  He does a rather flashy little
move.  Cut to Bella who is watching and laughing.
Martin, in an awkward tweed suit, is jiggling to the beat of a
song, entirely happy in the corner."|stage direction

1536||"A pretty green communal garden.  Children are playing, watched
by mothers, one of whom holds a new baby in a papoose.  A very
old couple wander along slowly.
A small tai chi group moves mysteriously.  And as the camera
glides, it passes a couple sitting on a single, simple wooden
bench overlooking the garden.  He is reading, she is just
looking out, totally relaxed, holding his hand, pregnant.  It
is William and Anna."|stage direction
