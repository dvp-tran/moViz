6||EXT. SHIP GRAVEYARD, STATEN ISLAND NYC - DAY|location
7||"It is early morning. A large bulk fuel oil transport truck
sits idling next to a decrepit old dock. The dock sticks into
a backwater section of New York harbor that is filled with
the decaying remains of half-sunken abandoned barges and tug
boats.
JULIAN, the young driver of the truck sits and nervously
scans the horizon. Eventually a large fuel barge appears in
the distance being pushed by a tug boat. The barge is steered
past the skeletons of the other sunken ships and makes its
way to the dock in front of the tanker truck.
JULIAN gets out of his truck and readies a large connecting
hose. He looks around nervously. JULIAN steps across the
broken boards of the dock and struggles to get the hose to
the barge. He hands it to the BARGE OPERATOR with a nod of
the head and no words.
They connect the hose and start a large generator as it
begins to pump fuel into the truck. They both scan the
horizon again as the sun begins to come up."|stage direction

freezing out. He is a very serious guy. He is not happy that
he is out of shape. Finally he stops and bends over to catch
his breath. We have run with him from the nicer part of the
neighborhood to a rougher section. As he catches his breath
he stands up and looks around. He is unsure of his feelings."|stage direction

The truck idles in traffic waiting to pay the toll to cross
the Verrazano bridge that spans the mouth of New York harbor.
JULIAN, the young driver from the dock, cautiously looks
around as the traffic inches along. He finally approaches the
toll booth and pays."|stage direction
14|JULIAN|Good morning.|speech
15||"JULIAN speaks English with a well-sanded accent. Is it
Central American or Mexican? The female collector gives him a
smile.
He heads through the booth, but there is still traffic on the
other side as the lanes merge together. Just as the traffic
is about to pick up he looks in his rearview mirror and we
see TWO GUYS come walking through the traffic and towards the
cab. Before we know it they are climbing up the cab steps.
The GUY on the driver's side, LOUIS SERVIDIO, is small and
very slight but he moves with great speed and strength. He
shatters the glass side window with his elbow. Unlocks the
door just as his partner, THUG #2, does the same thing on the
passenger side, but he is holding a gun. They are not wearing
masks. It's very brazen.
Before THUG #2 even asks JULIAN to get out of the cab LOUIS
SERVIDIO crushes him in the jaw with three swift punches then
pulls him out of the cab and down onto the roadway.
LOUIS SERVIDIO pulls the door shut and they drive away with
the truck leaving JULIAN sitting in the middle of the road
staring, as blood starts to flow from his jaw."|stage direction

other. ABEL is dressed in a very tasteful custom made suit.
ABEL's wife ANNA was driving the car behind him. She is a
beautiful, tall, blonde woman dressed to the nines but with a

25||"ABEL walks around and opens his trunk. He takes out two large
empty briefcases.
He carries the briefcases as they both walk over to a large,
unmarked, armored van that is idling in the middle of the
parking lot. Two ARMED GUARDS get out of the van. One is
holding a clipboard. He walks up to ANNA and ABEL. He hands
them the clipboard. They look at each other one last time and
then both sign the document.
The other GUARD opens up the back of the truck. ABEL hands
him the briefcases and the guard begins to fill them with
cash. Lots of cash. ABEL and ANNA stand at the open back of
the van and just watch. Finally he finishes and hands the now-
heavy cases to ABEL.
ABEL picks up the two cases and walks a bit away from the
truck. He turns to ANNA."|stage direction

WALSH standing in the middle of the dusty parking lot. ANDREW
is their longtime LAWYER/RIGHT-HAND MAN and is in his mid
fifties. He is smart but tired. The oversized briefcase in
his left hand seems to have permanently tilted his posture
that direction. The large oil-holding tanks loom above them.
The place is rusting and could use some work.
As they wait, the setting has the look and choreography of an
illegal transaction about to go down."|stage direction
34|ANDREW WALSH|So how are we this morning?|speech

strong yet you can understand every word."|stage direction
47|JOSEPH|So why is it you want this land?|speech
48|ABEL|I'm sorry?|speech
49|JOSEPH|"It has been difficult for you to
get me here, no? Over a year?"|speech
50|ABEL|Almost two.|speech
51|JOSEPH|"There are many like it around? And
thanks to all these tests you paid
for, we now know it is as much of a
mess below the ground as it is
above. My people have looked at
your books, I know this is a lot of
money for you, so why have you kept
on us so... just for this ugly and
polluted little piece of the earth."|speech
52|ABEL|"I have been looking over my fence
at this property for a very long
time."|speech
53|JOSEPH|So it is just proximity?|speech

ABEL"|"No... I imagine I want it for the
same reason you did."|speech
55|JOSEPH|And what's that?|speech
56|ABEL|To grow.|speech
57|JOSEPH|"Well, I am in the garment business
so I appreciate that sentiment. But
I inherited this land from my
uncle. Sadly he had no children of
his own. He was the one that let
them build these tanks here. So
this place can do little for me...
in fact thanks to all those tests
you've done it may be a liability.
As you know I offered to lease the
site to you at a fair price, but
you were not interested?"|speech
58|ABEL|No.|speech
59|JOSEPH|Why not?|speech
60|ABEL|I like to own the things I use.|speech
61|JOSEPH|I can see that.|speech

64|JOSEPH|"Yes. This contract here, your
lawyers have fully reviewed it?"|speech

JOSEPH (CONT'D)"|"No extensions, no... contingencies
whatsoever."|speech
68|ABEL|I understand.|speech
69|JOSEPH|"I want you to know this up front. I
am a very fair man but I believe in
honoring contracts. You will
fulfill your end of this contract
and the property is yours. If you
can't we will keep your money and
will sell it to your competitor who
has been chasing us almost as badly
as you have. I like you, but know
that the only reason I am choosing
you is because of the favorable
terms of this contract. So this is
business... and when you sign
this...."|speech
70|ABEL|I understand.|speech
71|JOSEPH|"Well then, let's see this money,
and then I will sign these papers."|speech
72||"ABEL turns to ANDREW and gives a slight nod. ANDREW pulls the
black briefcase onto the table and opens it. It has seven

getting them to this point. It's a
good day for us. Take a walk
around. Enjoy it for a second."|speech

decides to go for a little walk."|stage direction
79||"He heads out towards the tanks and walks among them. They
tower seven stories above him. As he walks, he is cut off
like a maze from any other visual input. (Similar to being
inside a Richard Serra sculpture) Finally he emerges into
some light and as ABEL looks up the camera reveals his view.
It's midtown Manhattan in all its glory, just across the East
River from the site. He stares at the city and we see the
true depths of his ambition lock on his face. He looks to his
watch."|stage direction

ABEL stands, surrounded by massive trees in the thick forest,
looking across the ridge back at his house. He is a little
out of breath after climbing the hill but he looks strangely
comfortable even though he is standing in the woods in a
suit, tie, and dress shoes. He takes a nice cigar out of his
pocket, lights it and has a real moment of joy. He looks up
to the tops of the trees, then back at the new house. He
exhales a long deep breath. Then we hear a large truck come
rumbling in the driveway. He hears it. His face shows that he
knows the sound immediately."|stage direction

tight hug. But then he ever so slightly checks himself and
places him back down on the table.

all business. They stare at each other."|stage direction

It's been two years since you first
started investigating my company
and I have spent thousands of
dollars hiring lawyers for this and
that to provide you with every
piece of information your office
has requested. And I expect that
you have been asking the same from
my competitors. So with all this
information that you have gained...
We are just asking if you have any
idea who has been doing this to us?
A.D.A. LAWRENCE
I don't."|speech

213|19|"A.D.A. LAWRENCE (CONT'D)
I understand your frustration. And
although everyone else seems to
have given up and left this city
for dead, I haven't. And as you
know we have been investigating
industry-wide corruption in your
business that seems to have been
going on for years. And the simple
fact is that the only person who
could do anything with 8000 gallons
of heating oil in a matter of
minutes after stealing a truck is
someone from within that industry.
And almost certainly someone with
local storage capacity. So you're
right. That means you all are
stealing from each other. Which is,
as far as I can tell, just a
refreshing new take on what you've
been doing to your customers and
fellow taxpayers for the last
fifteen years."|speech

217|ABEL (CONT'D)|"We are on the same side here.
A.D.A. LAWRENCE
Well yes and no. See, all that I
can do is to try and put people
away in the simplest and most
economical way possible with the
limited resources at my disposal.
It doesn't really matter to us who
it is or how we do it as long as
it's progress."|speech
218|ABEL|Well, it makes a difference to me.|speech

I know it does. This city is a very
difficult place to do business

our industry for over two years
looking for anything he can find.
And as you know probably better
than anyone, having worked with
some of our competitors the thought
that he would have singled us out
is ridiculous. It reeks of
everything that is wrong with this

property gives us many things...
firstly direct access to the river.
So I can bring in fuel directly
from any provider in the world
straight to my tanks, then it has
over 10 million gallons of storage
capacity, so I can buy in the
summers when my price is low and
sell to my customers and most
importantly some of my competitors
when the price is high. I won't
just drive trucks anymore... I will
control my fate... but the real
answer to your question..."|speech

there holding a small-yet-powerful Saturday Night Special-

fast. With each bump that the truck goes over the noise
inside the dumpster is deafening. As the KID comes to his
senses he tries to stand up. As he does, we see that the
sides of the dumpster are at least eight feet tall and the
interior is very slick without anything to grab or stand on.
He is trapped.
Just then the truck goes over another huge bump and comes to
a stop. It idles for a minute then begins backing up. It
stops. A warning, beeping alarm is heard, and finally one end
of the dumpster begins rising. As it gets higher and higher
our KID tries to hold himself back, but he begins to slide
towards the low end. As he does he sees that the end that he
is heading towards is on a hinge and it is starting to swing
open. Finally the thing is at such an angle that he can't
hold on any longer and he slides towards the opening.
As he falls out he/we see that he's being dumped over the
edge of a cliff of some sort. He falls probably 10-12 feet,
into a pile of garbage. As he gathers himself and tries to
stand, we see he is standing in a massive landfill. He looks
around as the truck pulls away. He's left totally alone."|stage direction

thinking about the cowards who did

sure you know Texas #4 is marked.
But that was just one load, so
every truck that has left my lot
for the last two weeks has been
marked with dye that I've put in...
And luckily four more of my trucks
got jacked since.... My guess is
there are at least 4600 gallons of
marked fuel in your small tank
