Evan, seventeen, a little too tall and slim, a boy who
clearly never figured out how to style his hair, is finishing
off a bowl of cereal. He is on his cell phone.
EVAN
What's up?
SETH
I was doing research last night, for next
year, and I think I'm gonna go with Bang
Bus.
EVAN
Which one's Bang Bus?
SETH
The one where they bang the chicks on the
bus. Thirteen bucks a month. Total
access, live Web Cam feed. The works.
It'll be like I'm on the bus, banging
them myself.
EVAN
That stuff's bullshit, they're all faking
it. And plus, your parents are gonna look
at the bill.
SETH
It shows up under a different name."|unknown

That wouldn't look good. Maybe I should
just pick the one with the least dirty
sounding name.
EVAN
Weapons of Ass Destruction's out then.
Seth pulls up in front of a house.

I could tell my parents I'm doing a

Evan walks out his front door. WE REVEAL he is walking
towards Seth's car.
EVAN
(still into phone)
Yeah. Just tell them your taking a class
on blow jobs.
They both hang up and Evan gets in the car. Seth is about to
pull away, when EVAN'S MOTHER comes out the front door.
EVAN'S MOM
Thanks for taking him, Seth.
Evan changes the radio station. Seth slaps his hand.
SETH
Don't touch that!
EVAN'S MOM
You two are so funny. I can't imagine
what you'll do without each other next
year. Evan told me you didn't get into
State.
SETH
Yeah, you know. I got some other places.
Good places. I think we'll be fine.
EVAN'S MOM
Are you going to miss each other?
EVAN
Miss each other? No!

They drive up to Clark Secondary. There is a giant sign that
reads ""Seniors - Two Glorious Weeks Until Graduation"". Seth
turns into the STAFF parking lot.

Seth and Evan walk past a group of smokers, towards the 7-11.
EVAN
You're being an idiot, man. You really
shouldn't park there.
SETH
Fuck it. I'm a senior about to graduate.
They should be suckin' my balls. It's the
least they can do for stealing three
years of my life.
They walk past DIMITRI (18, big Native American guy) as they
enter the store. Dimitri aggressively bumps his shoulder into
Seth.
EVAN
What the hell's wrong with Dimitri?
SETH
Oh, yeah dude, I forgot to tell you. I
knocked the fuckin' shit out of him in
capture the flag last week.
EVAN
Good! 9th Grade Camp he gave me whiplash
in ""King of the Ring."" I fucking hate
that guy.
They go to the magazine rack and stare at a Maxim cover.

EVAN (CONT'D)
Look at those nipples.
SETH
They're like baby toes.
EVAN
It's not fair. I have to hide every
erection I get.
SETH
Sometimes I get boners so big I can't
hide them. And then I get nervous and my
heart starts pounding, and it all just,
like, feeds my boner. It just becomes
this...thing...that's attached to me. And
it won't go away.
EVAN
Just imagine if girls weren't weirded out
by our boners and they actually wanted to
see `em, like this shit.
SETH
You know it's been, like, a year and a
half since I've seen an actual human
female nipple. Besides my mom's. I saw it
last month, and it was sick.
EVAN
Holy shit. Liat was two years ago? I
guess so. She was insanely hot, though.
SETH
Exactly. Too hot. That's what sucks.
EVAN
How can that possibly suck? I'd be
fuckin' psyched if I'd gotten with a girl
that hot. You got, like, two dozen
handjobs!
SETH
And three quarters of a blowjob, But that
was fuckin' it. It was the peak of my ass-
gettin' career, and it happened way, way,
way too early.
EVAN
You're like Orson Welles.

SETH
Exactly! If I'd built up to it, I'd
probably at least be having steady sex
with a mediocre-looking girl at this
point. I honestly now see why Orson
Welles ate his fat ass to death.
EVAN
You'll have sex in college. Everyone
does. And if not, you'll have the Bang
Bus.
SETH
But the key is to be good at sex by the
time you're in college. You don't want
girls to think you suck dick at fucking.
EVAN
I still think you've got a chance with
Jules. She got mad hot over last summer,
and clearly hasn't realized it, `cause
she still flirts with you.
SETH
Are you joking, man? Let's see here...she
dated Dan Remick, Matt Muir, Josh Corber
and what's-his-face. All of those were
cool guys. She's been hot way longer than
you think. Why would she end her high
school career with me?
EVAN
Well, Helen got with Ariel Shafir.
SETH
Yeah, and he was a complete fucking
loser. You're a step up from that. Which
is why you should stop being a pussy and
do her! You could nailthe shit out of
her for, like, two months before you
leave. That bitch looks like a good
fucker.
EVAN
Hey! I'm sick of you talking about her
like that, man!
Evan starts to walk out. Seth follows.
SETH
What, you can talk about that bitch all
day every single day, but I can't say one
thing about her?

I don't constantly insult her.
SETH
I didn't insult her! I said she looks
like a good fucker! She looks like she
can take a dick. That's a good thing.

Seth and Evan come out the front doors. TERRY, one of the
rough-looking smokers, calls out.
TERRY
Yo. Seth. Did you hear I'm having the big
grad party?
Evan, a little scared, keeps his distance.
SETH
No.
TERRY
Yeah.
Terry spits on Seth's shirt.
TERRY (CONT'D)
And you're not coming. Tell your fucking
faggot friend he can't come either.
Seth wipes the spit off. He looks at Terry and seems as
though he's about to say something, but is interrupted when
Terry starts hocking up more spit. Seth runs away as Terry
and his friends laugh. He catches up to Evan and they head
back to school.
EVAN
Wow. You really bitched out on that one.

I bitched out? You bitched out! You were
across the street before I even realized

BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF A P.E. CLASS
There are 30 guys standing behind the starting line of the
school's track. We hear a TEACHER yell ""Go!"" and the boys
start running.
We FOLLOW them from above. All the boys keep pretty much the
same pace except for one runner who slowly lags behind. The
group gets so far ahead of the him that he is alone in the
frame. He stops.
CLOSE UP OF THE RUNNER:
Kneeling on the track breathing heavily. It's Seth.

Evan is sitting in math class staring at HELEN'S breasts.
She`s a very tall girl and is athletic in a sexy way, wearing
volleyball team sweat pants and a tank top. He looks up from
her breasts to her face: she is staring right at him. He
immediately looks to the front of the class, embarrassed.
The bell rings and everyone leaves. Helen walks up to Evan as
they enter the hallway. He's really nervous. She offers him a
pen.
HELEN
Hey Evan, thanks for the pen.
EVAN
Oh, don't worry, no worries. Just keep
it. Then you'll just have it, and you
won't have to borrow another pen.
HELEN
Thanks...uh...I was going to ask you, did
you hear about Terry's grad party? It's

Because of all the other fun shit I'm off

Okay. So why weren't you at Dimitri's
