1||FADE IN|stage direction
2||1	EXT. CONSTELLATION OF ORION - NIGHT|location
3||"Stars glitter like diamonds on the black velvet backdrop of space.
The Belt of Orion is center screen, but much nearer and larger
than ever seen by an Earth-bound astronomer.
A speck of light appears in the lower left corner of the screen.
No spaceship can be seen, but only a glowworm, a solitary sperma-
tosoan gliding through the womb of the universe. Over this we HEAR
the voice of an astronaut. He is concluding a report."|stage direction
4|"ASTRONAUT'S VOICE
(o.s.)"|"So ends my last signal until we reach
our destination. We are now on automatic,
a mere hundred and five light years from
our base ... and at the mercy of com-
puters. I've tucked in my crew for the
long sleep. I'll join them presently."|speech
5||2	INT. CABIN OF SPACESHIP - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT|location
6||"The cabin is neither cramped nor spacious, but about the size of the
President's cabin in Air Force One. In the immediate f.g. is a console
of dials and switches flanked by four chairs. Only one of the chairs
is occupied. The astronaut's back is to CAMERA. There is a ladder
amidships which leads to an escape hatch. The after Dart of the cabin
is obscured in darkness. We hear the MUSIC of a Mozart sonata emanating"|stage direction
7||"from a phonograph of stereotape. The astronaut is speaking into a
microphone."|unknown
8|ASTRONAUT|"Within the hour we shall complete
the sixth month of our flight from
Cape Kennedy. By our time, that is ..."|speech
9||He pauses, looking up at:|stage direction
10||3	TWO LARGE CLOCKS - ON CABIN WALL|location
11||"One clock is marked SELF TIME, but instead of twelve numerals it has
twenty-four. One of the needles is moving very slowly.
The other clock is labeled EARTH TIME, and its units, like those of a"|stage direction
12||tachometer, are given by hundreds and thousands.|unknown
13||The largest needle of this clock makes one revolution every second.|stage direction
14||Over this we hear:|unknown
15|"ASTRONAUT'S VOICE
(o.s.)"|"But according to Dr. Hasslein theory of
time in a vehicle traveling at close to
the speed of light, old Mother Earth has
aged a few thousand years since our de-
parture -- while we have scarcely aged
at all."|speech
16||4	CLOSE ON ASTRONAUT|location
17||This is TAYLOR. He wears simple dungarees (or Churchill suit) and|stage direction
18||comfortable boots. He seems calm and pensive. Extracting the butt of|unknown
19||a cigar from the breast pocket of his dungarees, he lights it, then|stage direction
20||continues:|unknown
21|TAYLOR|"It may be so. This much is probable: the
men who sent us on this journey have long
since been moldering in forgotten graves;
and those, if any, who read this message
are a different breed. Hopefully, a
better one."|speech
22||He begins to roll up his left sleeve.|stage direction
23|TAYLOR|"I leave the twentieth century without
regret. Who was it? Marshall? ... said
'Modern man is the missin 'a link between
the ape and the human being.'"|speech
24||"He removes the cigar from his mouth, turns to look out through one
of the portholes into the astral night."|stage direction
25|TAYLOR|"One final thought -- nothing scientific,
purely personal. Seen from up here,
everything looks different ... Time bends
and space is boundless. It squashes a
man's ego. He begins to feel like no more
than a mote in the eye of eternity. And
he is nagged by a question: ahat if any-
thing, will greet us on the end of man's
first journey to a star? Are we to believe
that throughout these thousands of galaxies,
these millions of stars, only one, that
speck of solar dust we call Earth, has
been graced -- or cursed -- by human life?"|speech
26|(pause)|I have to doubt it.|speech
27||"He extracts a hypodermic needle from his breast pocket and injects
it into the vein of his forearm. He continues speaking."|stage direction
28|"TAYLOR
(sardonically)"|"That's about all. I wonder if Man, that
marvel of the universe, that glorious
paradox who has sent me to the unknown...
still makes war against his brother., and
lets his neighbor's children starve."|speech
29||"Taylor withdraws the hypodermic needle from his vein and secures it in
a drawer of the console."|stage direction
30|TAYLOR|"Well then, Earthmen: A missing link
salutes you. Bless you, my descendants."|speech
31||Taylor snuffs out the cigar butt and places it in the drawer beside the|stage direction
32||hypodermic. Then, flicking a switch Au cut off the Mozart, he rises and|unknown

35||"The longest needle of this clock now makes nearly two revolutions per
second. The shortest needle points to the numeral 2105."|stage direction
36||6	INT. CABIN - TRACKING WITH TAYLOR|location
37||"Space scientists have presumably solved the problem of weightlessness,
for Taylor walks the short distance from; the console to the after
section without particular effort. CAMERA FOLLOWS him, and we can now
see four glass capsules, or ""caskets"", in the rear of the cabin. Taylor
looks down at them."|stage direction
38||"7-	SEVERAL SHOTS - THE FOUR CASKETS - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V.
10"|location
39||"One of them is open. The other three are occupied by astronauts: DODGE,
LANDON and STEWART. They, too, wear dungarees and boots. Dodge and
Landon are thirtyish, clean-shaven, virile -- America's finest. Stewart
is a handsome young woman, her hair bobbed short. Their eyes are closed
and they do not appear to be breathing -- yet no undertaker could make
them so alive."|stage direction

41||He grasps the handle of his own casket and slowly pulls himself into|stage direction

shut and secures it. He adjusts two dials inside the capsule and lies
back, buckling his safety belt. CAMERA MOVES INTO A CLOSEUP of Taylor.

descent."|unknown
48||The topography of the planet bears little resemblance to our own. Much|stage direction

cratered desert of reddish hue. We can, however, make out a few narrow
""green belts"" and a patch of blue water."|unknown
50||In the FINAL SHOTS of this SEQUENCE we see the strange planet as it|stage direction

feet to one thousand feet. It appears that the ship will fall into a"|unknown

great CRASH as the craft hits water. The whole ship shudders on impact."|stage direction
56||"Loose equipment falls to the cabin floor. CAMERA MOVES DOWN the cabin
aisle as the ship begins to roll in the water and HOLDS on the four"|unknown

but not as much as before."|unknown
73|TAYLOR|"There goes our primary power. We're on

74||A slight CRACKING sound is heard. Taylor turns quickly away and o.s.:|stage direction

on the stricken spaceship, wallowing like a beached whale a hundred
yards offshore. The portholes of the craft are beneath the water, and
only its roof and the tail fin of its tail assembly are visible. The
red-hot skin of the ship vaporizes the water around it."|unknown

located amidships."|stage direction

106||"The spray of water coming through the ruptured seam is increasing.
The LIGHTS DIM again and the SOUND of the warning signal FADES. While
Landon fiddles with the radio, Taylor tries to get the tape recorder"|stage direction

111||The escape hatch is now open. Taylor darts over to the ladder and|stage direction

118||"Dodge inflates the raft with a cartridge of compressed air and
tosses it into the water. He and Landon jump into the water and
climb onto the raft as Taylor emerges from the hatch, Taylor slips
into the water and climbs onto the raft. He and Landon begin to
paddle toward shore, while Dodge immediately opens another kit and
takes a sample of the water."|stage direction

149||"Dodge moves inland about ten yards, removes a small hand drill
from his belt, extends the rod of the drill three feet and begins
to take some subsoil samplings. Taylor begins to examine the contents
of the three rucksacks. Landon sits down on the beach., hands around
his knees, gazing moodily at the sunken spaceship. During this and
succeeding scenes we sense that Dodge's obsession with scientific
inquiry leaves him immune to fear: Landon is possibly more courageous
and certainly more ""human,"" for he has many fears to control: while
Taylor -- detached, cool and misanthropic -- is something of an enigma."|stage direction
