onto the sofa.  Falling on top of him, rolling over and
leaving Oleg on the sofa.

in such a way that he can fall over backward and grab the
gun.  Emil limps toward the gun at the same time and it is

Emil steps back, revealing the knife is BURIED IN EDDIE'S
STOMACH.
Eddie stumbles backward, falling over but still attached to
the chair - holding the gun.  Eddie can't believe he got
stabbed.  Blood swells around his stomach.  He can't be
