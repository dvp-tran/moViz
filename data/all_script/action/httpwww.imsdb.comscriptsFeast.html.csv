69||"Bearded Camerman just stares at her in shock. He's missing
both his arms.
Mean Green lunges and grabs Chief's dropped pick-axe. She
HAMMERS at the chain around her waist.
Foot by foot, she's dragged closer. At the last second, she
BREAKS the chain, popping herself free.
She spins, running for safety. A guttural HOWL behind her
fills the cavern. Mean Green sprints toward the cave opening.
She's gonna make it. Only a few more feet. And then... JERK!
Something grabs her neck and YANKS her back into the darkness.
The whiplash sends her bloody BULLHORN flying into the light.
As it lands, it lets out one last weak HONK..."|stage direction
