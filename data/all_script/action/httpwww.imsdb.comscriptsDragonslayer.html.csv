1||"FADE IN:
CASTLE - NIGHT
Now comes the moon riding over the horizon. Upon a hill at
the edge of the wood squats a castle, its crude stonework
bathed in cold silvery light. Queer carvings and runes
decorate the ponderous gate. Heavy vines are climbing up the
walls. The castle is old, its unfamiliar form testament to
an ancient mind and an ancient craft. Flickering candle light
dances on a leaded windowpane.
Inside, the corridors are dark and silent. Under low arched
ceilings the uneven floors are paved with stone blocks.
Perched over lintels and crouched in niches are icons with
strange animal heads.
HODGE
A sleep on a straw palette in a room strewn with vegetables
and crockery is Hodge, a wrinkled old retainer. A flickering
candle and empty jug are beside the bed. He is snoring gently.
CONJURING ROOM
This circular chamber at the heart of the castle is stuffed
with parchments, scrolls, dusty books, bronze braziers, glass
retorts, chemical salts, birds both stuffed and caged. An
iron candelabra stands on a work table, tapers burning. In
the soft glow it seems that the room is unoccupied, but no,
moving in the background is a shadowy figure, preparing for
a magical deed. Feet are positioned carefully within a
pentagram chiseled into the floor. A scroll is consulted; up
comes an arm and a voice blurts out:"|stage direction
2|VOICE|"Omnia in duos: Duo in Unum: Unus in
Nihil: Haec nec Quattuor nec Omnia
nec Duo nec Unus nec Nihil Sunt."|speech
3||Nothing happens.|stage direction
4|VOICE|Come on, candles, out!|speech
5||"But the little flames stand at attention without so much as
a tremble."|stage direction
6|VOICE|"In Volunta Divina et Verbum Magi:
Lux! Exstinguat!"|speech
7||"It's no use. There is a sigh and the figure moves forward
into the light. Revealed in the glow is the discouraged face
of Galen Bradwardyn, sorcerer's apprentice.
TOWER
Carrying the candelabra, the youth trudges up a circular
staircase.
TURRET
The highest point of the castle is a turret, open to the
stars and the night air. Here, more magic is afoot. An old
enchanter, Ulrich, Magister Ipsissimus, pours water from a
silver ewer into a stone bowl. As the surface ripples
disappear he leans forward and gazes into the pool. All at
once his face hardens as the distant sounds of screams and
thunder reach his ears. Lights and shadows, reflected from
within the basin, play across his face. His frown deepens as
the sound of his own voice comes to him from the vision in
the water -- Draco draconis -- suddenly squelched by the
roar of flame and an ugly snarl.
At that moment Galen reaches the top of the steps and holds
up the candelabra."|stage direction
8|GALEN|"Vide, Magister. There's something
wrong."|speech
9||"Ulrich, startled from his trance, slaps the water out of the
basin and turns to confront his student. Galen is taken aback
by the old man's grim countenance."|stage direction
10|GALEN|What's the matter? What's happened?|speech
11|ULRICH|"I've just seen something. Something
of consequence to you."|speech
12|GALEN|To me?|speech
13||(calm)|location
14|ULRICH|Yes. My own death.|speech
15||"With a distracted gesture he causes the flames to extinguish
themselves."|stage direction
16|ULRICH|"Perhaps we had better hasten your
training."|speech

18||"BARNYARD - DAY
Outside the castle wall Hodge is feeding the chickens and
ducks. He straightens up and squints through the early morning
mists. On a distant hillock two figures are moving toward
the woods.
ULRICH AND GALEN
Hobbling slowly with the aid of a pair of canes, Ulrich guides
his pupil across a wooden bridge and along a stream into the
forest."|stage direction
19||(stern and troubled)|location
20|ULRICH|"This wood, these leaves, the birds,
the very dome of heaven, once they
all rang with one great chord: and
philosophers like me kept it all in
tune. Now, new voices are singing
new songs."|speech
21||(sharply)|location
22|ULRICH|"Have you mastered the threefold
transmutation?"|speech
23|GALEN|Of course.|speech
24||(skeptical)|location
25|ULRICH|You have?|speech
26|GALEN|Well, almost.|speech
27|ULRICH|"It's very difficult. Have you
committed to memory undying the Codex
de Profundis?"|speech
28||(a shrug)|location
29|GALEN|The first two chapters.|speech
30|ULRICH|"It's long. And what about the Ritual
of Banishment as prescribed by my
late master Balisarius?"|speech
31|GALEN|"To tell the truth, I haven't dared
try it. What's the point, anyway?"|speech
32|ULRICH|"The point? The point is you don't
know it, and you're no magician
without it. It was my hope to school
you, to mold your faculties and
wits... I still believe you have
some talent. Somewhere."|speech
33|GALEN|"I hate books. I hate drill. I want a
real task."|speech
34|ULRICH|"There's no time now. When I'm gone,
half the powers in the universe will
vanish with me. And what's the use
of a few lingering skills if they're
left in the hands of a child?"|speech
35||(pause)|location
36|ULRICH|Listen!|speech
37|GALEN|I don't hear anything.|speech
38||"Ulrich gauges the young man standing before him and makes a
decision. Reaching under his cloak he lifts off a fine silver
chain with an amulet dangling from it. He drapes it around
Galen's neck."|stage direction
39|ULRICH|Here, wear this.|speech
40||"Galen instinctively wraps his hand around the jewel. He cocks
an ear."|stage direction
41|GALEN|Voices, singing on the road.|speech
42||"He hastens forward to a promontory, eager to have a look.
Ulrich does not follow. Instead, doffing his cloak, he whirls
it before him, where it magically floats a few feet off the
ground. Awkwardly, the old man clambers aboard."|stage direction
43|GALEN|I don't see anything.|speech
44||"He turns back, but the wizard is gone. A shadow falls over
him. He looks up. There, two hundred feet above the tree
tops his master is soaring on the wind.
AIRBORNE
The old conjurer squints into the distance. Miles away and
far below a company of drab walkers winds along the margins
of the forest. They are singing a mournful round.
GALEN
He gawks skyward. Suddenly, the old man leans down and
addresses him."|stage direction
45||(a shout)|location
46|ULRICH|We have visitors!|speech
47||CUT TO:|unknown
48||"ROTUNDA - NIGHT
Clustering together in the center of a wide reception hall
is a contingent of weary peasants, awkward amidst the dusty
rugs, drapes and heavy furniture. Their leader is a fineboned
youth, not yet twenty. Like the others, he is uneasy; his
name is Valerian. Hodge enters and sets a tray of mead before
them. He leaves without a word. The visitors stare glumly at
the refreshment, but are too timorous to go near it.
CONJURING ROOM
Galen helps Ulrich prepare for the audience. The sorcerer
peers at himself in a full-length mirror, adjusting the hem
of a black robe."|stage direction
49|ULRICH|"Looks forbidding enough, don't you
think?"|speech
50|GALEN|Here are your sticks.|speech
51|ULRICH|"No -- they'll think me infirm. You
know, Balisarius wore this whenever
he changed lead into gold. He could
really do that, you know. I never
could. Too bad -- you'd stand to
inherit some real wealth."|speech
52|GALEN|"You're in a morbid frame of mind.
What's all this about dying? You
don't even look sick."|speech
53||(tying on a sash)|location
54|ULRICH|You still wearing that amulet?|speech
55||(Galen nods)|location
56|ULRICH|"Good. Don't lose it. It still belongs
to me."|speech
57||"He backs away from the mirror and fits a silver coronet onto
his head."|stage direction
58|ULRICH|"Now, adeptus minor, get yourself a
handful of that sulphurous ash over
there..."|speech
59||"The sorcerer starts down a circular stone staircase.
THE ROTUNDA
The visitors watch warily as a door swings open and Galen
makes his entrance, his face expressionless and hands pressed
together. He looks rather young to be the famous Ulrich.
Galen allows a moment to go by, then throws his arms wide.
Ka-whump! and Ulrich appears in the doorway in a smoky
fireball. Alarmed, the visitors retreat."|stage direction
60|ULRICH|Nunc habeus lux!|speech
61||Pffst! around the room candles flare in their niches.|stage direction
62|ULRICH|Et calor!|speech
63||"In the fireplace, the birch logs are suddenly ablaze. Ulrich
totters to the hearth and extends long bony fingers toward
the warmth."|stage direction
64|ULRICH|"Welcome to Cragganmore. I am Ulrich.
Which one of you calls himself
Valerian?"|speech
65||"The travelers are suitably dazzled by the magician's
performance. The young leader of the party screws up his
courage and speaks."|stage direction
66|VALERIAN|"That would be me. We are here on
behalf..."|speech
67|ULRICH|"I know why you're here. You're a
delegation from Urland, from beyond
Dalvatia. Let's see the artifacts."|speech
68||"The travelers exchange nervous glances. Valerian motions to
one of his companions. The man steps forward and hands over
a leather pouch. One by one, Valerian places the contents on
the table for Ulrich's inspection."|stage direction
69|VALERIAN|"A bone. Scorched. A rock, fire-
blackened."|speech
70||(pause)|location
71|VALERIAN|Scales.|speech
72||"At this, Ulrich advances and closely examines three shimmering
irridescent disks as big as saucers."|stage direction
73|ULRICH|All right. How did you come by these?|speech
74||(proudly)|location
75|VALERIAN|"I found them. At the mouth of the
lair."|speech
76||(grim)|location
77|ULRICH|What else?|speech
78||"Valerian reaches under his jerkin and withdraws what appears
to be a curved sword. He jabs it into the table."|stage direction
79|VALERIAN|A claw.|speech
80|ULRICH|"That's no claw. It's a tooth. By the
gods!"|speech
81||"He runs a finger along a serrated edge and gazes bleakly at
his visitors."|stage direction
82|ULRICH|"And you want me to do battle with
that?"|speech
83||Valerian has lost all trace of timidity.|stage direction
84|VALERIAN|"Who else can we turn to? We all know
what we're dealing with here. This
is a basilicok."|speech
85||"(he takes a step
forward)"|location
86|VALERIAN|A cockatrice.|speech
87||(another step, bolder)|location
88|VALERIAN|A dragon.|speech
89||"(he leans close to
Ulrich)"|location
90|VALERIAN|"This is no stag, no bear, no natural
creature. This is one of your kind.
And only a necromancer such as
yourself can rid us of it."|speech
91|ULRICH|"Did you try the Meredydd sisters?
What about Rinbod? I've heard it
said he killed a dragon once."|speech
92|VALERIAN|"They're all dead. You're the only
one left."|speech
93||"With a sigh, Ulrich lowers himself into a chair. He rubs his
withered legs and shakes his head."|stage direction
94|ULRICH|It's a long way to Urland.|speech
95|VALERIAN|"Every quarter, upon the solstices
and the equinoxes there's a new
victim."|speech
96||Greil, a grizzled peasant, speaks up.|stage direction
97|GREIL|My daughter, for one.|speech
98|OTHER TRAVELERS|My sister... cousins...|speech
99|ULRICH|All women?|speech
100|VALERIAN|"Girls. Virgins, to be exact, chosen
by lot."|speech
101||"Galen edges over to the table and inspects the scales and
tooth."|stage direction
102|GALEN|Master, don't you think --|speech
103|ULRICH|Silence!|speech
104||He broods for a long time.|stage direction
105|VALERIAN|Are you afraid of dragons?|speech
106|ULRICH|"No. Sorcerers and dragons go back a
long long time together. If it weren't
for sorcerers, there wouldn't be any
dragons."|speech
107||(pause)|location
108|ULRICH|All right. I'll go.|speech
109||CUT TO:|unknown
110||"COURTYARD - DAY
The travelers are making ready for departure in the grey
light of dawn. As Hodge stuffs provisions into a wicker box,
Ulrich wraps padding on a newly fashioned pair of crutches."|stage direction
111|ULRICH|"I know of this dragon. Vermithrax
Pejorative: she's four hundred years
old. As far as I can tell she's the
last of her kind. Very appropriate
that I'm the one to finish her off,
don't you think?"|speech
112||"(he tries out the
crutches)"|location
113|ULRICH|"There. Flatten the highest mountain.
What say you, Galen?"|speech
114||(no answer)|location
115|ULRICH|Speak up.|speech
116||(still no answer)|location
117|ULRICH|You, Hodge.|speech
118||Hodge mutters something inaudible and grimly keeps packing.|stage direction
119||(to Galen)|location
120|ULRICH|"While I'm gone see you keep your
nose in your books and your hands
out of my reagents. Leave my
instruments alone too."|speech
121||"Galen crouches against the castle wall; he regards his master
sullenly."|stage direction
122|GALEN|"Look at yourself. How far will you
get like that? A league, two leagues?"|speech
123|ULRICH|I'm not worried about the road.|speech
124||(sarcastic)|location
125|GALEN|"Why don't you wave your hands around
and summon up a coach-and-four?"|speech
126|ULRICH|Don't mock me.|speech
127||Galen gets up and calls out to the Urlanders.|stage direction
128|GALEN|"You pilgrims: You're used to
lotteries. Why not draw straws to
see who'll be first to carry
ironshanks here."|speech
129||This is too much for Hodge.|stage direction
130|HODGE|"Hold your tongue. If the master's
got a mind to go, he'll go."|speech
131||Galen approaches the old sorcerer.|stage direction
132|GALEN|"Send me. You're always saying I need
seasoning. I need a test. Let me go."|speech
133|ULRICH|You're not ready.|speech
134|GALEN|I'm ready for anything.|speech
135||(wan smile)|location
136|ULRICH|"Don't be so hasty. Your time will
come."|speech
137||"The walkers are ready to set forth. Hodge picks up his pack,
steps forward and pulls open the great gate.
HORSEMEN
Three mounted men are outside the gate, helmets on their
heads, swords on the belts and longbows across their
shoulders. They look formidable. The Urlanders take a step
backward."|stage direction
138|VALERIAN|Tyrian!?|speech
139||"Tyrian is a lean, heavily bearded nobleman. There is a coat
of arms on the shield strapped to the pommel of his saddle."|stage direction
140||(amiable)|location
141|TYRIAN|Good morning, all.|speech
142|VALERIAN|"We're not afraid of you. Give us the
road."|speech
143|TYRIAN|"Why, the road is yours. All the way
to Urland. It's a long journey, isn't
it? But when you're in search of a
sorcerer, I suppose no distance is
too great."|speech
144||"Sensing trouble, Galen moves forward. Ulrich touches his
arm."|stage direction
145||(under his breath)|location
146|ULRICH|Say nothing.|speech
147||"Galen hears the urgency in the old man's voice and obeys.
Hodge takes it upon himself to deal with the strangers."|stage direction
148|HODGE|What do you want with us?|speech
149|TYRIAN|"Well, like my good friends here,
I've come for a bit of black magic.
No doubt you've heard of our troubles
at home. This is Cragganmore, is it
not?"|speech
150|HODGE|Aye, this be the place of Ulrich.|speech
151||Tyrian dismounts and saunters up to the old magician.|stage direction
152|TYRIAN|"And here we have the mystical presence
himself, no?"|speech
153|HODGE|"You'd best keep your distance -- and
your manners."|speech
154|TYRIAN|"If he's ready to lay a dragon in its
grave, he's got nothing to fear from
me."|speech
155||(turns to the Urlanders)|location
156|TYRIAN|"I've no more love for that creature
than you lot. Nor has the King. But,
before you stir things up, don't you
think it a good idea to see you've
got the right man for the job?"|speech
157|HODGE|"Aha -- it's a test you're looking
for. We don't do tests."|speech
158|TYRIAN|"I'm sure you don't. They never do
tests -- and not many real deeds
either. Oh, conversation with your
grandmother's shade in a darkened
room, the odd love potion or two...
but comes a doubter, well then, it's
the wrong day, the planets are not
aligned, the entrails aren't
favorable, we don't do tests."|speech
159|VALERIAN|"We've got no doubts. We require no
test."|speech
160|HODGE|And you're not going to get one.|speech
161||"When Ulrich finally speaks, his voice is low and
authoritative."|stage direction
162||(to Galen)|location
163|ULRICH|"Go to the conjuring room. The iron
box. Fetch me the dagger within."|speech
164||Galen's eyes widen with alarm.|stage direction
165|ULRICH|The dagger. Be quick.|speech
166||"Galen dashes into the castle. Ulrich gazes almost shyly at
Tyrian."|stage direction
167|ULRICH|You shall have your test.|speech
168||"CONJURING ROOM
Galen comes puffing up the steps, locates the iron box, and
flings it open. Amidst the tawdry paraphernalia of a
professional magician is an ivory-handled dagger covered
with runic inscriptions. Galen eagerly examines it to see
how the blade might twist aside or collapse into the handle,
but it is all too genuine. A murder weapon."|stage direction
169||(impatient)|location
170|ULRICH'S VOICE|Where are you, boy? I'm waiting.|speech
171||"Galen throws open a window and looks down into the courtyard.
He displays the dagger."|stage direction
172|GALEN|Not this one, was it?|speech
173|ULRICH|The very one. Let it fall.|speech
174||"Galen hesitates, then tosses it. Tumbling end over end, it
arcs downward. The old conjurer calmly stretches out a hand
and plucks it neatly out of the air. Galen watches as Ulrich
passes the weapon to Tyrian and strips back his robe exposing
a bony chest. Galen knows what's coming. He rushes for the
door. He's only a step away when it bangs shut of its own
accord. He sprints for a second exit. Whack! This door slams
shut too. Locked in. Quick, back to the window and climb
down the vine... Smack! the heavy shutters seal him in.
ULRICH AND TYRIAN
Ulrich takes Tyrian's arm and guides the point of the dagger
to his breastbone."|stage direction
175|ULRICH|Vita regula, vita hieratica!|speech
176||"Everyone is filled with dread. Hodge is shaking. From the
castle come the rattling of shutters and Galen's muffled
cries. A sick sarcastic smile has crept over Tyrian's lips.
He tenses himself to thrust."|stage direction
177|ULRICH|"Go on. Don't worry, you can't hurt
me."|speech
178||"CONJURING ROOM
Galen stops hammering and presses his face to a crack in the
shutter. Below he can see the participants in this grisly
drama. He holds his breath. Tyrian makes a sudden movement
and buries the blade in Ulrich's chest. But the sorcerer
stands unbent, seemingly unhurt. Then, after a long moment,
he slowly sags forward over the dagger and the hand that
holds it. Tyrian shrinks back and allows the body to fall in
a heap. Very quickly he remounts. In another moment he and
his companions are gone. The others are riveted in horror.
Hodge sinks to his knees and wails his grief.
Galen turns away from the window and gazes blankly into the
gloomy conjuring room. Click! The doors unlatch themselves
and swing open."|stage direction
179||CUT TO:|unknown
180||"FUNERAL PYRE - DAY
Ulrich, principal magician and sorcerer of the western world,
reposes on a hardwood pyre. His hands are folded on his chest.
His face is peaceful. While the visitors wordlessly look on,
Galen touches a burning brand to the kindling. At first the
fire catches normally enough, but when the flames start to
envelop the body they suddenly turn pale green, producing an
unearthly roar. The onlookers back away from the intense
heat.
GALEN
The erstwhile apprentice stands his ground, blinking back
tears, his face weirdly illuminated by the fire."|stage direction
181||CUT TO:|unknown
182||"CONJURING ROOM - DAY
Galen sits alone amidst the museum-like collection of magical
apparatus. He stares at the amulet, considering its
significance. His reverie is interrupted by the murmur of
voices below. At the window he looks down to see Hodge bidding
farewell to the delegation from Urland. Valerian is the last
to leave. He pauses at the gate and glances up at Galen.
Then he moves on. The young student of magic sets his jaw,
suddenly filled with resolve.
Moving through the room, he busies himself with the old man's
effects. He scoops up the loose books and parchments and
locks them into trunks. He drapes muslin cloths over the
alchemical devices. He sows a handful of salt over the
pentagram inscribed in the floor. Finally, he opens the cages
and releases the crow, the falcon, and the great horned owl.
COURTYARD
Hodge is up on the burned out funeral pyre, anxiously scraping
ashes and small bones into a leather pouch -- the remains of
Ulrich. Up behind him comes Galen, now clad in a traveler's
cloak, with a pack on his back and a staff in his hand."|stage direction
183|GALEN|Hodge -- what are you doing?|speech
184||Hodge quickly conceals the pouch.|stage direction
185|HODGE|"Just making my farewell, thank you
very much."|speech
186||"He quickly climbs down, picks up his pack and follows Galen
out through the gate. As the door is pushed shut a huge oaken
timber falls into place, barring the castle against the
uninvited."|stage direction

188||"HILLTOP - DAY
Galen and Hodge labor to the crest of a grassy hill and turn
to look back across a wide valley. There on another hilltop
on the far side sits Cragganmore, lit by the red rays of the
setting sun. Galen removes the amulet from his neck and
clutches it in his fist. Hodge is bug-eyed to see it."|stage direction
189|HODGE|"Be careful with that! You don't know
what you're doing."|speech
190|GALEN|Stand back!|speech
191||He raises his hands toward the castle and calls out:|stage direction
192|GALEN|"Cragganmore! Domus non i am! Silva
celet!"|speech
193||"CRAGGANMORE
The vines on the castle walls begin to twitch and stretch,
magically brought to animate life. They flow upward over the
masonry, branching out and covering every surface, then up
onto the roof. Finally only the tops of the chimneys and the
highest turrets stand above the green carpet. A century's
growth in a matter of seconds.
GALEN & HODGE
On their hilltop the old retainer gives the youth a fearful
look. Galen is too flushed with excitement over what he has
done to notice."|stage direction

Galen and Hodge trudge along an overgrown cart-track under
an arch of trees."|stage direction

dwell. It doesn't matter who you
are, a king in his robes, a peasant
in his rags, when your time comes,
no magic can save you..."|speech
197|GALEN|I guess...|speech
198||"The apprentice's mind is elsewhere: he's got a coin hovering
in mid-air above his palm, bobbing gently as he walks."|stage direction
199|HODGE|"...the kindest lord a man could ask
for... now he's gone. Ye gods he was
fussy about his bath. And you'd think
he could boil his own eggs with the
snap of a finger, but no, he had old
Hodge do it, of course."|speech
200||(snurfling)|location
201|HODGE|"Up before five I was, mucking out
the cages, slopping the pigs, and
never once got so much as a thankyou
or a pat on the back..."|speech

203|HODGE|I'm going to miss him.|speech
204|GALEN|Me too...|speech
205||"He plucks a low-hanging leaf, waves a hand over it, and
watches it turn into a spray of daffodils."|stage direction
206|HODGE|"No you don't. All you care about is
the tricks and knavery. Well, you
don't pull any wool over these old
eyes. It'll be a mighty long walk
before you fill his shoes, you mark
my word."|speech
207|GALEN|"What's the matter, Hodge, pack too
heavy? Here."|speech
208||"He gives the pack a slap. It flies out of its harness and
floats alongside them. Hodge snatches it back and clutches
it tightly."|stage direction
209|HODGE|Careful with that!|speech
210|GALEN|Too cold, is it?|speech
211||A great coat drapes itself over Hodge's shoulders.|stage direction

leaving him in his smalls."|stage direction

the master!"|speech

THE GIRL
She strains against her manacles, cocking her head to listen
as the rumblings below subside. Presently the steam and smoke
blow away and she can see the horse pawing and stamping a
hundred yards distant, the wheel of the cart jammed between
rocks. Summoning up a wild will to live, she squeezes her
hands against the cold iron rings. No use. She spits on her
wrists and twists desperately. Blood starts. One hand slips
free. She looks at the horse. The animal tosses off its
blindfold and looks back at her. Now she strains again and
pulls her other hand free. She wipes the blood on her frock
and sprints toward the horse. But she doesn't get there. The
earth abruptly shifts from under her feet, tumbling her among
cracked and steaming rocks. When she raises her head a huge
shadow has fallen over the horse. There is a piteous whinny,
then a roar. The girl's face is suddenly lit by flames. She
scrambles to her feet and rushes back the other way.
THE CHASE
The girl hasn't taken a dozen steps when something huge
hurtles forward and blocks her way. Something scaly and
glittering. She whirls and stumbles off in a new direction.

like talons. She screams and crawls away. Another claw
prevents her escape.

lifts and he finds himself in a gully face to face with the
cowering Urlanders. They look with real fear at the man who
just conjured up the Apocalypse. Tattered and torn, covered

CELEBRATION
Galen is surrounded by a crowd of wide-eyed kids and not a
few adults, entertaining them by pulling duck's eggs out of
their ears and causing coins to disappear. Presently he feels
the attention of his audience shift away to someone standing
behind him. He turns to find a shy but determined Valerian
sweetly decked out in her blue frock. A buzz goes through
the crowd. Valerian blushes and wavers: she seems ready to
bolt for home. But Galen takes her by the hand, and with
conspicuous politesse leads her to the dance.
DANCE
It's forward, back and around sixth-century style: the young
sorcerer can't take his eyes off his partner. But she's too
shy to return his gaze."|stage direction

Casiodorus Rex, King of Urland, a bearded man in his fifties,
as spare and somber as the room in which he sits. He is
flanked by a few servants, assorted courtiers and Tyrian.
Standing before them all is Galen, looking unhappy. He pours
a pitcher full of water into a small glazed goblet."|stage direction

Carrying torches to light their way, families -- some with
maiden daughters -- gather from all over the country in the
courtyard of the King's castle. Simon is there with Valerian,
and so is Galen, disguised in rough farm clothes and a wide-
brimmed hat. Like many others, he carries a stick topped
with a bleached skull -- to all appearances, just another
participant in this weird pagan ritual. A barrel decorated
with flames and dragon's wings sits on a raised dais in front
of the main entrance. Horsrik, the King's herald, supervises
preparations for the lottery. Armed guards appear carrying a
sealed chest. Horsrik breaks the seal and the guards pour
the contents -- hundreds of wooden tiles, each bearing the
name of a potential sacrifice -- into the barrel. Trumpets
blare and drums roll and the royal party strolls onstage:

nothing he moves on to a cabinet. He breaks the lock and
pries it open. Again, nothing.
CASTLE CORRIDOR
Galen can hear the voices in the courtyard as he rushes down
a hall. Suddenly he stops short. There in front of him is a
guard leaning out a window to watch the proceedings. Galen
hovers on the verge of panic as the guard abruptly moves.
But the man is only headed for another window and a better
view. Galen manages to fall into step an arm's length behind
him and slip by without a sound.

Galen enters the library, his enormous shadow dancing crazily
on the torchlit walls. Hurrying through, his attention is
drawn to some open books on a table. Closer inspection reveals
magical writings and symbols. Galen paws over everything,

the rear is Tyrian. At last the cart can go no further.

hard as he can in a wide arc. The blade never even slows
down as it sails right through the post, lopping it clean
off. The glowing sword flashes above Galen's head and eagerly
buries itself in Tyrian's chest. The King's man is as startled
by the amputated piling as he is by his own death. His eyes
roll up in his head, his knees buckle and he topples backward --
the blade sliding free.

glow."|stage direction

paved first with rock, then with dragon scales, then with
bones. With each footfall, clusters of mysterious insects
scuttle away. Galen pauses to mop his brow; it's getting
hot. A sound echoes up from the depths, a grinding sound
like the gnashing of teeth, followed by hissing and squealing.
Galen grips his sword tighter and pushes on. Suddenly he
stoops and picks up an embroidered slipper: Elspeth's. The
grinding sounds are louder. He hurries forward and rounds a
corner. He stops and gags.
BASILISKS
Two disgusting little reptiles -- like scaly raccoons -- are
perched on the corpse of Princess Elspeth Ulfilas, feeding
contentiously on choice bits of the royal flesh. Galen groans:
he lashes out and his sword beheads one of the tiny monsters.
The other one buzzes its half-formed winglets and hisses a
hot stream of air. Galen brings down the sword and slices it
in half. Eyes riveted on Elspeth's remains, he edges around
the carnage and backs away. Hissss! -- there's a third one,
lurking in the shadows, munching on something; it might be a
hand. Galen shrieks and jumps away. The little creature comes
at him and clamps its jaws on his leg. Galen stabs at it
repeatedly. Finally it lets go, and flails and flops across
the bloody floor, ululating its death agony. As the creature's
last mewlings echo down through the cavern, the ground
quivers. Bits of stone fall from the ceiling.
LAKE OF FIRE
Galen works his way down a narrow passage whose walls are
alive with insects and beads of sulphurous water. As before,
he holds the sword in front of him; he marvels at its
increasing brightness. The heat is increasing too; sweat
mats his hair and runs down his face. A few yards further on
the sword starts pulsating. Now the walls take on a flickering
rosy sheen and the passage widens into an underground vista
of staggering immensity: an underground lake, its surface
bubbling and torn with sheets of flame. Arching over it is a
vault of stone, penetrated here and there by natural chimneys.
The dimensions of this internal world are unknown -- the
fiery lake disappears into half a dozen side chambers. The
one clear path is accessible only by a series of flat stones
leading across the hot liquid. Galen grips his sword and
resolutely hops from rock to rock.
VERMITHRAX
He's halfway across when the earth rumbles and the stepping
stones teeter beneath his feet. A fiery wave washes over his
legs, leaving his boots smoking. Another tremor knocks Galen
to his knees. As he scrabbles to pick up his sword and shield,
the great head of Vermithrax rises up out of the depths on
its long neck. It gazes at him through huge pale eyes under
armored lids. A tongue flicks out and runs around its lipless
mouth. The head sways from side to side. The mouth hinges
open, the nostril-like igniters come on and touch off the
jet of gas squeezed up out of its innards. A roaring tube of
flame engulfs Galen. He crouches behind his dragon scale
shield which deflects the fire just enough to save his life.
The dragon pauses to take a breath. Galen springs to his
feet, and bounds back the way he came, his skin and clothing
singed. Flames lick at his back as the dragon lets fly with
a second burst.
TUNNEL
Coughing and weeping, Galen staggers up through the tunnel,
nearly tripping over the body of one of the baby dragons. A
few seconds later, Vermithrax follows, squirming and clawing
its way upward. When it reaches its dead offspring it surveys
the scene with expressionless eyes. Bringing its head low,
it sniffs and nudges at the lifeless little ones.
AMBUSH
At that moment Galen leaps out from behind a niche in the
tunnel wall and lunges forward. Striking sparks, the point
of his sword slides across the dragon's plated cheek and
stabs deep between the scales of its heavy neck. There is an
unearthly shriek and the creature flicks its head back and
upward. Galen goes sprawling and finds himself holding half
a sword. The rest is buried in the beast's neck, and
Vermithrax doesn't like it. It flings its head this way and
that, knocking rocks loose from the ceiling. Its movements
cause the ground to quake. As boulders tumble around him,
Galen drops to the floor under his shield. Dragon flame
reaches through the cascading debris and washes over him."|stage direction

up the blunted sword. She scans the rocks and finally sees
