1||1 INT. DARK STAGE - NIGHT 1|stage direction||
2|OPENING CREDITS:|"A SPOTLIGHT slices black space.
In its beam, a DANCER materializes. She is fair-skinned.
Beautiful and pure.
The maiden twirls on pointe, a smile on her face, light as
air and carefree.
She pauses, her face grows worried. Sensing someone watching.
Scared, she peers into the darkness.
She moves now, looking, growing more frantic.
Then, a SINISTER MAN emerges out of the darkness behind her.
She stumbles backwards, frightened.
She tries to escape, twirling away, but he pursues. His true
form is revealed, the demon ROTHBART.
He flings his open hand towards her, casting the spell.
She wants to scream, but nothing comes out. She looks at her
body, sensing something happening to her. Something
terrifying.
She spins, panicking, but it's too late. She disappears
beneath the beast's cape.
She emerges as the WHITE SWAN, the iconic protagonist of SWAN
LAKE.
CUT TO BLACK."|speech|OPENING CREDITS:|?
3||2 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING 2|stage direction||
4|OPENING CREDITS:|"In the darkness, a pair of EYES. They belong to NINA, the
same dancer. She lies awake in bed, thinking about her dream.
The room looks like it hasn't been redecorated since she was
a teenager. Stuffed animals. Dolls. Pink and frilly.
The door opens, throwing LIGHT on her face. Nina looks
towards the door and smiles softly at whoever opened it.
Nina sits up and hangs her BARE FEET off the side of the bed.
Like all ballerinas, she's beautiful and her feet are
atrocious. Covered in corns, broken blisters and bunions. She
arches them, doing her first extensions of the day.

5||3 INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING 3|stage direction||
6|OPENING CREDITS:|"The room is empty of furniture to leave space for dancing. A
large mirror covers the opposite wall entirely.
Nina rubs her knees to get them warm, and then begins her
morning exercises, extending and contracting her feet and
legs in precise and rhythmic motions.
The skin on her chest stretches tautly over her sternum.
Defined vertebrae run up her back, sinewy muscles contract as
she moves. Her slender neck leads into her hair, contained
in a ballerina's bun.
Nina looks serene as she moves, completely in her element.
She hears someone fussing about in the kitchen."|speech|OPENING CREDITS:|?

night. I was dancing the White
Swan.
No answer."|speech|NINA|F

Bolshoi's. It was the prologue,
when Rothbart casts his spell.
Still no answer.
Nina continues to stretch."|speech|NINA|F

more."|speech|NINA|F

22|NINA|What?|speech|NINA|F
23|ERICA|"There.
Erica points to her shoulder. Nina feels and finds a small
SCRATCH MARK.
She shrugs and shakes her head.
Erica gives her a suspicious look, but lets it go and smiles.
Nina finishes pulling down the sweatshirt.
Erica hugs Nina into her chest and kisses the top of her
head."|speech|ERICA|F

Erica releases her and Nina begins eating."|speech|ERICA|F
25||5 INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY 5|stage direction||
26|ERICA (CONT'D)|"Nina rides inside a crowded subway, staring absentmindedly at
her faint reflection in the train's window.
Suddenly, another train roars by on the opposite track,
snapping her awake.
In the next train car, she sees the back of a BALLERINA
standing in the midst of the crowd. Her head bops to music
playing through iPod earphones.
Nina moves a strand of hair out of her eyes, and at that
exact moment, the girl in the next car moves in the same way.
Mirroring her.
Unnerved, Nina slowly lowers her arm. So does the other girl.
Although Nina can't quite see her face, the girl seems
IDENTICAL from Nina's vantage point.
4.
The train jerks to a stop as it arrives at a station. Nina
sees the girl head to the exit. She cranes to see her face,
but her view's obscured.
The doors slide shut and the train pulls out. Nina watches
the platform whisk by, keeping her eyes peeled, but she
doesn't see the girl."|speech|ERICA|F

28||7 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER - DAY 7|stage direction||
29|ERICA (CONT'D)|"Nina emerges from the subway station onto a city street.
She arrives at the MAJESTIC-LOOKING THEATER, where a few
other BALLERINAS likewise trickle towards the entrance. They
all look strangely similar: slender, carrying shoulder bags,
wearing leggings and loose sweatshirts.
She passes a ROW OF POSTERS featuring the company's prima
ballerina, BETH MACINTYRE.
Nina looks at them, a little envious, before continuing on to
the STAGE DOOR."|speech|ERICA|F
30||8 INT. SOLOIST DRESSING ROOM - DAY 8|stage direction||
31|ERICA (CONT'D)|"Crammed into a single dressing room, Nina and the company's 5
SOLOISTS get ready for rehearsal. Chatting, sewing ribbon
onto shoes, applying makeup, putting band-aids on blisters.
Nina removes a new pair of BALLET SHOES, admires them for a
moment, before cutting off the satin toe with scissors.
In the background, catty VERONICA and Russian GALINA gossip."|speech|ERICA|F
32|VERONICA|Can't believe she's back.|speech|VERONICA|F

(ROLLING EYES)"|Yeah, we know.|speech|VERONICA|F
48||"Irked, Nina starts POUNDING the shoes against the floor to
soften the toe.
Her eyes are drawn to a NEW GIRL standing in the doorway.
Nina pauses to scrutinize her. She wears vampy make-up, hair
down. Dark and sexy."|stage direction||
49|NEW GIRL|Soloists?|speech|NEW GIRL|F
50||Wary, the girls mumble mmm-hmm's and nod.|stage direction||
51|NEW GIRL|"NEW GIRL (CONT'D)
Great.
6.
She slinks past the suspicious group of girls and plops down
at an open spot.
NEW GIRL (CONT'D)
Fucking got off the wrong stop and
had to hoof it from 79th.
Nina exchanges glances with the other girls, taken aback.
The new girl notices the looks, smirks to herself and starts
getting ready."|speech|NEW GIRL|F
52||9 INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 9|stage direction||
53|NEW GIRL|"Nina wears a look of intense concentration as the entire
company warms up, including the pubescent CORPS MEMBERS and a
handful of MALE DANCERS.
LEGS, HANDS, and FEET repeat the same movements all around
her, led by a severe BALLET MISTRESS."|speech|NEW GIRL|F
54|BALLET MISTRESS|"To the back, fondu, to the back,
plie. Fourth, fourth, and one and
fifth, to the back...
(to a corps member)
Like this. Push it. Why can't you
do this?
Using the mirror, Nina monitors her movements carefully. The
mistress surprises her.
BALLET MISTRESS (CONT'D)
It needs to be looser. Relax. Let
it flow.
Flustered, Nina nods and tries to follow her instruction.
Suddenly, the girls around Nina begin stripping off their
sweatshirts and insulated pants.
Nina sees that the intense and brooding director of the
company, THOMAS LEROY, has entered the space. He has the
unkept look of an artist. Magnetic and intense.
The ballerinas remove their warm-up gear to show off their
bodies.
Leroy walks around the room, judging his flock. Smiles and
glances are thrown his way.
He goes up to the ballet mistress, takes her hand and kisses
her on the cheek. Even she manages a smile.

55||He heads to the line of soloists, studying them.|stage direction||
56|LEROY|"We all know the story: virginal
girl, pure and sweet, trapped in
the body of a swan. She desires
freedom, but only true love can
break the spell."|speech|LEROY|F
57||"He taps a dancer on the shoulder, she lights up. He walks,
then taps another. A selection process of some kind.
Nina looks nervous, has an inkling of what it means."|stage direction||
58|LEROY (CONT'D)|"Her wish is granted in the form of
a prince."|speech|LEROY|F
59||"He nears Nina. She sneaks peeks at him, eager and hopeful.
He acknowledges her with a small nod and a smile.
But he walks on without tapping her. She deflates."|stage direction||
60|LEROY (CONT'D)|"But before he can declare his love,
her lustful twin, the Black Swan,
tricks and seduces him."|speech|LEROY|F
61||"He approaches the New Girl. Nina watches, threatened.
But he doesn't tap her either."|stage direction||
62|LEROY (CONT'D)|"Devastated, the White Swan leaps
off a cliff, killing herself. But,
in death, finds freedom."|speech|LEROY|F
63||"He taps one more soloist and then CLAPS.
The music stops and all the girls face him, attentive."|stage direction||
64|LEROY (CONT'D)|Good morning, company.|speech|LEROY|F
65||"They respond ""Good morning"" in nervous, unsure voices."|stage direction||
66|LEROY (CONT'D)|"We open our season with Swan Lake.
Done to death, I know. But not like
this. We strip it down. Make it
visceral and real."|speech|LEROY|F
67||He pauses for effect.|stage direction||
68|LEROY (CONT'D)|8.|speech|LEROY|F
69|LEROY (CONT'D)|"And a new production needs a new
Swan Queen. A fresh face to present
to the world.
Surprised, the soloists glance at each other, trying to keep
their cool."|speech|LEROY|F
70|LEROY (CONT'D)|"But which of you can embody both
swans? The white and the black?
Nina prepares for disappointment."|speech|LEROY|F
71|LEROY (CONT'D)|"All the soloists I touched...
Please go to your scheduled
rehearsals this afternoon.
The girls are confused."|speech|LEROY|F
72|LEROY (CONT'D)|"And the girls I didn't touch, meet
me in studio B at five.
Nina breathes, realizing the girls he didn't tap are the ones
he's selected, purposefully toying with them."|speech|LEROY|F
73||10 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY 10|stage direction||
74|LEROY (CONT'D)|"Hidden inside a nook, Nina has her eyes closed, nervously
HUMMING the score to Swan Lake.
She makes small motions with her feet and hands, going
through the choreography in her mind. Preparing for the
audition.
A loud CRASHING sound snaps her out of it.
She goes out into the hallway to investigate.
The door to a PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM is halfway open. Nina
cautiously approaches.
Inside, she can see someone moving around the room in a fury,
trashing it.
Suddenly, the door swings open and BETH MACINTYRE bursts out.
She makes brief eye-contact with Nina."|speech|LEROY|F
75|BETH|"What?!
9.
Nina just shakes her head.
Beth scoffs as she slams the door behind her. She clips down
the hall in the opposite direction.
Nina waits until she's gone, then moves closer to the door
and peeks inside, curious.
She checks to make sure no one's around and quickly enters."|speech|BETH|F
76||11 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - SAME 11|stage direction||
77|BETH|"Large and comfortable. Beth's presence is everywhere.
Photographs, clothing, and personal belongings scattered
across the space.
Nina looks at herself in the mirror and smiles, imagining how
great it would be...
Then she notices a LARGE VASE lying on the floor. The flowers
have been shredded, water everywhere.
She moves to the vanity counter and touches Beth's
belongings in reverence. The items are neatly laid out:
ballet supplies, jewelry, and makeup.
Her fingers brush a tube of LIPSTICK. She picks it up.
Nina slips the lipstick into her bag and exits the room."|speech|BETH|F
78||12 INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 12|stage direction||
79|BETH|"In the middle of her audition, Nina dances Odette's Variation
from Act II of the ballet, a frightened look on her face.
Although her movement is incredibly precise, there's a
definite vulnerability. Exactly as the White Swan should be:
fear tinged with melancholy.
Leroy waves his arm. The music and Nina stop abruptly.
He approaches her and, when he gets close, taps on her
sternum with two of his fingers."|speech|BETH|F
80|LEROY|"So Nina, would you like to be the
Swan Queen?"|speech|LEROY|F
81|NINA|"If you want me to be.
He leans in and talks softly so the other girls can't hear.
10."|speech|NINA|F
82|LEROY|"Well, if I was just casting the
White Swan, she'd be yours."|speech|LEROY|F
83||She can't help but smile, flattered. He pulls away from her.|stage direction||
84|LEROY (CONT'D)|But I'm not.|speech|LEROY|F
85||He turns to the PIANO PLAYER.|stage direction||
86|LEROY (CONT'D)|Maestro, Odile's Coda.|speech|LEROY|F
87||The piano player rifles through the song book.|stage direction||
88|LEROY (CONT'D)|Show me your Black Swan, Nina.|speech|LEROY|F
89||"Nervous, she glances over at Veronica and Galina, who
anxiously await their turn.
She takes a few breaths, then looks towards the piano player
and nods.
The music begins.
Nina dances a few steps, and then launches into the most
difficult and famous part of Swan Lake: The Black Swan's
Coda. It consists of 32 consecutive fouettes (spins)."|stage direction||
90|LEROY (CONT'D)|Come on, not so controlled.|speech|LEROY|F
91||"The music builds in intensity, she pushes herself into the
next turn."|stage direction||
92|LEROY (CONT'D)|"Seduce us! Not just the Prince, but
the court, the audience, the entire
world! The fouettes are like a
spider spinning her web. Come on!
Attack it! Attack it!"|speech|LEROY|F
93||"Leroy runs his hand through his hair, dismayed.
A look of worry spreads across Nina's face. Knows she's
blowing it.
The door CLANGS open and throws Nina's focus completely. She
stumbles, several spins short of finishing."|stage direction||
94|LEROY (CONT'D)|"11.
The New Girl obliviously marches into the room, listening to
an iPod."|speech|LEROY|F
95|"LEROY (CONT'D)
(SARCASTIC)"|"Good of you to join us.
The New Girl notices everyone staring and pulls out her
earphones to talk."|speech|LEROY|F
96|NEW GIRL|Sorry.|speech|NEW GIRL|F
97|LEROY|"Girls, this is Lily. Straight off
the plane from San Francisco. She's
filling Rebecca's old spot.
LILY gives a small wave. Nina eyes her with scorn as she
catches her breath."|speech|LEROY|F
98|LEROY (CONT'D)|Go on, get warmed up.|speech|LEROY|F
99|LILY|"I'm good.
Lily starts stripping off her layers, revealing her lithe
body. On her back, she has a TATTOO OF LILIES."|speech|LILY|F
100|NINA|Should I go again?|speech|NINA|F
101|LEROY|"(distracted by Lily)
I've seen enough. Thank you, Nina.
She looks down, getting his meaning."|speech|LEROY|F
102|LEROY (CONT'D)|"Okay, Veronica. Your turn. The
White Swan's variation...
Furious, Nina marches out of the room."|speech|LEROY|F

110|LEROY (CONT'D)|"Nina walks along a quiet side street. She clutches her
jacket, for warmth and comfort.
Her CELL PHONE starts ringing. She digs it out of her bag and
checks the CALLER ID: MOM. She silences it and puts it away.
Up ahead, she sees the sidewalk dead end at a construction
site, and detour into an enclosed PASSAGEWAY beneath the
scaffolding.
Nina slows, a little scared, but decides to push on.
The passageway is dark. The temporary lighting dim and
flickering.
She walks quickly, trying to get to the other side.
She hears the sound of soft FOOTSTEPS approaching. She
stops, and the other FOOTSTEPS stop.
She looks up and sees the faint outline of a SLENDER WOMAN
standing there, almost ghostlike.
Nina starts walking again, keeping her head down, and the
other woman continues as well.
13.
As they pass each other, Nina glances at the woman's face and
discovers...
The woman looks EXACTLY LIKE HER.
But the moment passes as the woman continues walking.
Nina stares after her, perturbed.
Her cell phone starts RINGING again, piercing the silence.
Nina continues out, ignoring the phone."|speech|LEROY|F

She turns and is startled to see Erica standing right there."|speech|LEROY|F
113|ERICA|"How did it go?
Nina looks at her confused. Erica helps take off her coat."|speech|ERICA|F
114|ERICA (CONT'D)|"You were late, so I called Susie in
the office. An audition?! Can't
believe he just sprung that on you.
Nina nods."|speech|ERICA|F
115|ERICA (CONT'D)|So?|speech|ERICA|F
116|NINA|It went okay.|speech|NINA|F
117|ERICA|"Just okay?
Erica hangs up her coat, turns and sees Nina tearing up."|speech|ERICA|F

The tears start falling now.
Erica goes to her and wraps her in an embrace."|speech|ERICA|F

122|(FROM KITCHEN)|"I told them it doesn't matter how
talented their daughter is, if she
misses any more classes, she's out.
She forgets half of what I teach
her, and I waste time catching her
up. It's ridiculous.
Nina sits up and retrieves a pair of point shoes from her
bag. She considers them for a moment, then starts to put them
on.
She stands, takes a breath, and does a single spin, testing
the waters.
She takes a breath and spins again, then again, then again.
Each spin is punctuated by a jab of her foot into the floor.
THWACK, THWACK. THWACK.
She jabs her toe down, hard..."|speech||
123|NINA|"Ow!
She winces in pain and automatically grabs her foot.
ERICA (O.S.)
Everything alright?"|speech|NINA|F
124|NINA|"I'm fine!
Nina leans her back against the mirror and removes her shoe.
Her right big toenail has split, oozing blood.
Nina breathes through the pain and puts her shoe back on.
She reassumes the position, takes a couple breaths, and
starts spinning again.
Her toe jabs into the floor. She winces a little with pain,
but keeps pushing.
Her face grows more determined, focused. 20, 21, 22 spins....
She starts to look powerful, willing herself to succeed.
14A."|speech|NINA|F

finished it."|speech|NINA|F

Annoyed, Nina lies down, looking away from her mother."|speech|ERICA|F
134|ERICA (CONT'D)|"Oh, sweetheart, I know it's
disappointing. When you start to
get older, there's all this
ridiculous pressure. God knows, I
understand.
Erica squeezes some arnica gel into her palm and massages it
into Nina's calves."|speech|ERICA|F
135|ERICA (CONT'D)|"But it's alright. No matter what.
You'll probably get to dance the

During the applause, Nina catches a glimpse of David
backstage, sweaty, laughing and holding someone's hands. Nina
can't see who, her view obscured by moving bodies and limbs.
Suspicious, Nina moves to get a better look.
Revealing that David's flirting with Lily.
Nina tenses.
Then the Four Little Swans rush offstage past Nina. She
watches them go, unsettled."|speech|STAGE MANAGER|?

All the swans are frozen in two rows on each side of the
stage, looking downstage.
David launches Nina into the air, hands around her waist.

He slowly turns her around, keeping her held high.
From her swirling, bird's eye view, Nina sees the rows of
identically dressed Little Swans glaring at her...
Nina freaks, jerking her body.
David's grip SLIPS and Nina SLAMS onto the stage.
It's a horrific moment that feels like an eternity.
Gritting her teeth, Nina looks up around her, sees the faces
of the other ballerinas. Staring at her sadistically.
Nina finds Lily, glancing at David. He snaps to and quickly
helps Nina up."|speech|STAGE MANAGER|?
987|DAVID|"What the fuck?
She's too freaked to respond.
They resume dancing, Nina barely keeping it together.
Behind them, Rothbart appears and commands his flock to exit.
The Little Swans start swirling off stage.
Leaving Nina and David alone.
David tries to pull her in one direction, but the dark hand
of Rothbart summons her, transforming her back into a swan.
She pulls away from David, frantically flapping, until she

Rothbart has to go back on stage to finish the Act.
Other CORPS MEMBERS surround her, chirping ""You okay?, ""What

Dazed, Nina doesn't answer. The music ends and there's a weak
smattering of applause.

The other dancers scurry to get ready, abandoning her.

Leroy runs his fingers through his hair, his back to Nina.

The Double gets her hands around Nina's neck...
Gasping for air, Nina tries to pull the hands free, but she's
too strong."|stage direction||

The Double squeezes down.
The blood vessels in Nina's eyes BURST again. Her neck starts
to stretch unnaturally. Strength surges through her body and
she lunges...
Finally grabbing the SHARD.
And DRIVES it into the Double's stomach.
Nina glances at her hand, cut by the mirror, then back up.

there either.
She slowly opens the door to the wardrobe...
And finds it empty. No body whatsoever.
She looks over at the broken mirror. Sees her reflection
staring back at her.
She stares at it for a long beat, and realizes something.
She touches her stomach and winces a little. Pulls back her
hand. It's coated with red liquid. Blood.
It's started to soak through the costume, creating a faint
red spot. The fabric is ripped at the center of the stain.
She feels inside for confirmation.
And discovers a stab wound, in her own stomach.
