time. He's looking at something off camera, deep in thought.
He starts quietly dictating a love letter into a small
microphone.
THEODORE
To my Chris, I have been thinking
about how I could possibly tell you
how much you mean to me. I remember
when I first started to fall in
love with you like it was last
night. Lying naked beside you in
that tiny apartment, it suddenly
hit me that I was part of this
whole larger thing, just like our
parents, and our parents' parents.
Before that I was just living my
life like I knew everything, and
suddenly this bright light hit me
and woke me up. That light was you.
Theodore, searching for the right words, quietly enjoys
writing the letter. As he continues, he is moved by the
memories he's describing.
THEODORE (CONT'D)
I can't believe it's already been
50 years since you married me. And
still to this day, every day, you
make me feel like the girl I was
when you first turned on the lights
and woke me up and we started this
adventure together. Happy
Anniversary, my love and my friend
til the end. Loretta. Print.
Cut out to reveal a computer monitor he's sitting at. On the
screen we see the letter he's been dictating, transcribed
into a handwritten letter on blue stationery.
As he says ""Loretta,"" we see ""Loretta"" being handwritten at
the bottom of the letter. He proofreads his letter. Also on
the screen are photos of a couple in their 80s. The couple is
tagged ""Chris"" and ""Me - Loretta."" Underneath is a bullet
point email from Loretta: anniversary letter to husband
Chris, married fifty years, love of my life, met right after
college, have had the greatest life together.
Theodore pushes print and the letter comes out on a beautiful
robin's egg blue piece of stationery, with ball point pen
handwritten older-female cursive. He looks at it, not happy.

letters to Chris and starts a new one. There is also a stack
of finished letters in their envelopes - an assortment of
beautiful stationery in all shapes and sizes.
THEODORE (CONT'D)
Chris, my best friend. How lucky am
I that I met you fifty years ago?
How lucky are we...
We track off of Theodore, down a line of cubicles, hearing
bits of letters being written and seeing photos of who
they're being written to on the screens.
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN LETTER WRITER
Dear Nana, Thank you so much for my
truck. I love the color and I play
with it every day. It's the best
truck I've ever seen. Love, Tommy.
We see photos of Tommy and Nana on the screen, and five-year
old hand writing. Moving off of her, we find another letter
writer.
LETTER WRITER 2
What a beautiful wedding and what a
gorgeous bride. There wasn't a dry
eye in the house, especially mine.
Your aunt and I are so proud of
you. I hope you and your lovely new
wife will come visit us in Florida.

How do you share your life with

Well, we grew up together. I used

through her masters and Ph.D. And
she read every word I ever wrote.
We were a big influence on each
other.
SAMANTHA
In what way did you influence her?
THEODORE
She came from a background where
nothing was ever good enough. And
that was something that weighed
heavy on her, but in our house
together, there was a sense of just
trying stuff and allowing each
other to fail and to be excited
about things. That was liberating
for her.
