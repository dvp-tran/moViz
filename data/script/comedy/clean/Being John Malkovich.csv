A small marionette stage stands in the back of the garage.
The stage is lit and on it is a finely sculpted puppet
version of Craig. The ""Craig"" puppet paces back and forth,
wringing its hands with incredible subtlety. We see Craig,
above and behind the stage. He is manipulating the puppet.
His fingers move fast and furious. The puppet breaks into
a dance, a beautiful and intricate balletic piece. Soon the
puppet is leaping and tumbling through space, moves that one
would think impossible for a marionette. Sweat appears on
the real Craig’s brow. His fingers move like lightning. The
puppet moves faster and faster. Sweat appears on the puppet's
brow. We see that the sweat is being piped from a special
device that the real Craig controls. The Craig puppet
collapses on the floor of the stage. It puts its hands up to
its face and weeps. Craig hangs the puppet, and comes down
around the front of the stage. He is heaving. He switches
