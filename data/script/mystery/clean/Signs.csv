Graham's eyes move across the room.  The kitchen table is
upside down and leaned up against the pantry door.
THE SOUND OF A GLASS JAR BREAKING ON THE GROUND CAN BE HEARD
INSIDE THE PANTRY.
Graham takes a few conservative steps to the middle of the
kitchen.
He leans a little bit and listens.  From behind the pantry
door WE HEAR THE SOUND OF BREATHING.  THERE ARE QUIET
MOVEMENT SOUNDS.  THE SOFT SOUND OF GLASS BEING CRUSHED AS
IT'S BEING WALKED ON.
Graham can almost see the bottom of the door around the
leaning table.  Graham stands up straight and thinks it over.
Beat.
Graham takes two small steps closer.
When he leans, he can now see the entire bottom of the pantry
door.  THERE IS LIGHT LEAKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT.  THERE IS
SHADOW BEING THROWN FROM INSIDE THE PANTRY.  THE SHADOW MOVES
BACK AND FORTH UNDER THE DOOR."|stage direction|||

Graham bends down where he stands.  He puts his head near the
wood floor.  He tries to look under the door.  All he can see
are the bottoms of a couple shelves in the corner of the
pantry.  He's at too severe an angle.
Graham sits up.  He's only four feet away from the pantry
door.  He looks around not knowing what to do.  His eyes fall
on a bunch of kitchen knives that have spilled from a drawer
onto the floor.
He takes a butcher knife from the group and moves closer to
the door.  Beat.  He reaches with the butcher knife
underneath the slanted kitchen table.  He uses the knife like
a mirror to see under the door.  Graham watches the SOFT
REFLECTION IN THE FLAT STAINLESS STEEL SURFACE OF THE BLADE.

He takes a deep breath and starts to lower his head under the
slanted table.
He stops halfway down.  He loses his nerve and sits up.  He
rises to his feet as he places the butcher knife on the
counter.  Graham starts walking across the kitchen.  He gets
to the door.  Puts his hand on the doorknob.
He stays like that for a long time.  Beat.
Graham lets go of the doorknob -- He turns and walks quickly
across the kitchen -- He picks up the butcher knife -- He
kneels down next to the pantry -- He ducks his head under the
slanted kitchen table -- He places his cheek to the floor,
only inches from the bottom of the door, and looks into the
pantry.
There is broken glass and rice throughout the wooden floor of
the pantry.  Nothing else.
Graham stares at his VIEW OF THE FLOOR.  Something's wrong.
Parts of it feel like a painting.  THE PAINTING MOVES.
TWO BLACK EYES OPEN -- SEEMINGLY SUSPENDED IN THE MIDDLE OF
THE ROOM.  THEY ARE SIDEWAYS.  THEY LOOK AT GRAHAM.
GRAHAM YELLS.  HE JOLTS UP.  HIS HEAD HITS THE SLANTED TABLE
HARD.
FOUR LONG FINGERS AND CLAWS, THE EXACT COLOR OF THE WOODEN

942||"WE ARE WATCHING THE HOUSE FROM THE CROPS.  We see Graham
inside the house, closing the window shutters in one room
after another.
WE SEE a stack of wooden boards on the porch.
OUR VIEW MOVES to the barn where Isabelle is tied.  She is
not pacing.  She is not barking.  She sits staring right at
us.  She is shivering.
OUR VIEW MOVES to the garage building where we see Merrill
carry a huge pile of his clothes and things down the stairs.
He's moving into the main house.
Merrill walks across the yard.  His eyes look around
carefully as he moves.
Part of the pile in his arms falls to the grass as he crosses
the lawn.  He stops walking and starts to gather up the
fallen things.  He picks up a couple shirts and two baseballs
encased in glass cases.
The glass encasing one of the souvenir baseballs, has
cracked.  He takes the ball out.  Stares at it.
We watch from the crops as Merrill puts down his pile of
clothes and things on the grass.  He looks around and finds
what he's looking for.  A rake.
Merrill unscrews the fork on the rake from the wooden handle.
With the wooden stick in one hand and the souvenir baseball
in the other, he turns to face the crops.
WE PULL BACK A LITTLE INTO THE CROPS.  PART OF OUR VIEW IS
OBSCURED BY STALKS, BUT WE STILL SEE MERRILL CLEARLY.
Merrill looks around cautiously again, before getting into a
batter's stance.  His left leg digs into the grass in front
of him.  His weight is mostly on his back leg.  He looks out
into the distance high over the crops.  He throws the
baseball up in the air...
Merrill grabs the wooden handle.  Merrill's shoulders move
with blinding speed.  The wooden rake handle slices the air.
And misses the ball.
The ball drops at Merrill's feet.
WE WATCH as Merrill picks up the ball and tries again.  This
time his shoulders move even faster.  The wooden stick
actually makes A RESONANT SOUND as it cuts the air.
The ball drops at Merrill's feet.
WE WATCH THROUGH THE CROPS as Merrill snatches the ball up
and tries a third time.  This time he YELLS as he swings.  He
rips the air with the wooden stick so fast it blurs to the
eye.
The baseball drops at his feet.  Strike three.
Merrill stands still in the yard.  He's breathing a little
heavy as he stares down at the ball.
He gently picks it up.  He walks back to his pile of things
and then suddenly turns.  He throws the ball in the air as he
does.  His left leg goes out.  His weight goes to his right
leg as he turns his shoulders with astonishing speed and
power...
THE SOUND OF THE BASEBALL HITTING THE WOODEN HANDLE CRACKS
ACROSS THE WHOLE YARD.
The ball rockets into the air.  We watch it fly overhead...
sail high over the crops... it becomes a tiny dot in the sky.
After a long beat of silence it comes back to earth.  It
lands in the street and bounces twenty feet into the air.  It
cleared at least four or five hundred feet of crops.  Maybe
more.
WE LOOK BACK to Merrill standing in the backyard.  He drops
the wooden stick to the grass and moves for his things.  He
piles them in his arms.  When his arms are full, he starts
for the porch.  WE WATCH FROM THE CROPS AS MERRILL GOES
INSIDE THE HOUSE."|stage direction|||
