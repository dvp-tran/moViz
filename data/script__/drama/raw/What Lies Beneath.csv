1||"FADE IN:
Moving through a murky haze.  Dark blues and greens, shafts
of prismed purple.  A pale shard appears in the distance.
Gliding closer, a group of tiny fish dart before the camera.
We're UNDERWATER.  Arriving at the form, it finally sharpens
into focus.  It's a WOMAN'S BODY submerged in dark water,
arms floating lazily at her side.  The face is obscured by
flowing hair.  All that is visible is a pair of COLD, STARING
GREEN EYES, which blink closed..."|stage direction

3||"...then open as BLUE EYES, as a DIFFERENT FACE emerges from
water.  CLAIRE SPENCER awakens from this unsettling dream in
her bathtub.  She pivots the large BRASS SHOWER HEAD (the
kind that moves up and down on a pipe) off to one side,
reaches toward her feet and we hear the sound of a plug being
pulled."|stage direction

5||"A HAZY SHAPE-- accompanied by a whirring sound.
A steam covered mirror is cleared with a BLOW DRYER.  Claire
starts to come into focus.  The dryer stops.  She presses the
red G.F.I. button on the socket.  ZAP!  A big blue spark
shoots out.  Claire pulls her hand back...and the dryer
starts whirring again.
She clears the mirror and replaces the dryer on a hook.  She
regards herself in the mirror, and attractive, elegant-
looking woman around forty.
Claire traces a finger along a small but noticeable SCAR
above her left eye, then slowly drops the hand to her cheek,
as if confirming her existence."|stage direction

9||"Claire makes her way past half-filled boxes and duffels to a
window, then pulls the curtains to reveal:
A LOVELY, WOODED LAKE.  It couldn't be more picturesque.  A
24' SAILBOAT is moored at the dock and an OLD STONE
LIGHTHOUSE sits on a point across the lake.
The sunlight motivates an unconscious groan from A FIGURE
still shrouded by covers.
Claire sits beside the sleeping form.  She scans the room
briefly, taking in a Greenpeace flag and a picture of a
tomboyish ten year-old girl at camp.
She gently pulls back the covers and peers down at the same
face, now a waifish, pretty seventeen year-old, with chopped
hair and tiny nose ring.  Claire leans over and inhales the
sleeping scent of her only daughter, CAITLIN.  She places her
hand on a cheek.  The girl's eyelids flutter softly."|stage direction

she stands, something catches her eye out a window.  She
gazes down, transfixed.

Through a stand of trees over a HIGH WOODEN FENCE, A YOUNG
COUPLE is in the midst of a heated argument next door.
Claire watches as the HUSBAND, a large imposing man with an
unruly shock of red hair, snarls at his wife across the hood
of their huge old Buick.  She tries to get a glimpse of the
woman, but all that's visible is THE BACK OF HER BLOND HEAD.
A TAN, SINEWY ARM encircles Claire's waist.  She lets out a
small gasp as a hand closes on her breast.  It's Claire's
husband, DR. NORMAN SPENCER, nibbling gently at her neck.
He's older than she, pushing fifty, with silver streaks
beginning to permeate the shaggy mop of hair that makes him
look more like a preppy rocker or a lacrosse coach than the
prominent academic that he is.  Claire, however, can't take
her eyes off the scene below."|stage direction

38|NORMAN|"Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures.
They're all psychotic."|speech

begins, once again, to nuzzle Claire.  Her eyes close, but

armful of FOLDED LAUNDRY.  She moves quickly to the bureau,
not wanting to spend much time in here, then grabs a TINY
BLACK TOP from the pile, and drops it into a drawer.  She's
just about to close it, when something catches her eye.
CLAIRE'S POV
She drops the laundry and slowly pulls a tattered, old
JUILLIARD T-SHIRT with a very seventies logo from the drawer.
Claire gazes around the room, which is a reliquary of
Caitlin's recently concluded childhood; PICTURES, TROPHIES,
STUFFED ANIMALS.
She brings the now faded T-shirt to her face and drinks in
the smells.  She stares down at the word ""Juilliard."""|stage direction

arm draped around her waist.  A CELLO CASE stands beside her.

sees propped in the corner...THE CELLO CASE.  She gazes at

The yard is surrounded by a HIGH WOODEN FENCE.  She collapses
into a lawn chair as the tears begin to subside.  Suddenly,
she hears something coming from next door.
She cocks her head and attempts to make out the sound.  It
is, ironically, the sound of a WOMAN CRYING.  Claire makes
her way over to the fence.  The women's sobbing becomes more
plaintive and fevered.
She places her face against the prickly, vine covered fence
and tries to peer through the crack.  All she can make out is
A DARK BLUE BLUR that seems to be rocking.  Claire gathers
her nerve and calls out..."|stage direction

CLOSED.

again, this time failing completely.

make out the HINT OF A FAINT FEMININE VOICE echoing the tone.
