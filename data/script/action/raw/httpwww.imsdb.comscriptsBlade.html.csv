BOOM! Entry doors swing open as PARAMEDICS wheel in a FEMALE BLEEDER,
VANESSA (20s, black, nine months pregnant). She's deathly pale,

the dead. We PLUNGE INTO the darkness of her mouth and find
ourselves --
INSIDE HER BLOODSTREAM
The sound of a HEART BEATING, pounding as we whip-snake through --
CORPUSCLES
floating in amber plasma. Erythrocytes, leukocytes, neutrophils and
eosinophils.
The rhythmic expansion of the artery walls, pulsing with each
successive surge of blood as the HEART BEATS FASTER AND FASTER,
taking us --
IN UTERO,
A CHILD, alive but unborn, shifting in a sea of amniotic fluid,
surrounded by the white, protective substance known as vernix
caseosa. The HEARTBEAT races like a locomotive now. The unborn child
shifts, turns its head towards us --

32||INT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - NIGHT|location
33||"Dennis follows Raquel through the bowels of the plant, catching
glimpses here and there of carcasses being rendered or hacked apart.
Through one partially open door we see what might be a line of
BODYBAGS being trundled into the back of a truck via a hook and chain
pulley-system. But Dennis doesn't have enough time to be disturbed by
the vision, because he's being pulled away by Raquel, led down --
A STAIRWELL
We are in the basement now. At the end of the hall is a steel door,
with perhaps, just the faintest HINT OF MUSIC heard coming from
beyond. Raquel knocks.
A ""peep-hole"" slat opens and a BLACK LIGHT shines into Raquel's eyes.
A VOICE behind the door offers a verbal challenge, speaking a
language we've never heard, laced with a devilish cadence.
Raquel responds in kind. The door opens. Raquel gives Dennis a
knowing wink, enters. Dennis follows."|stage direction
34||INT. CLUB - NIGHT|location
35||"Raquel and Dennis move past a hulking DOORMAN, making their way down
a narrow stairway. Dennis is suitably impressed.
THE CLUB
is elite, underground -- an ""abattoir-chic"" version of an old-time
juke joint with a greasy, dangerous vibe. White-tiled walls and
floors for easy hosing, chromed fittings, run-off gutters, drains. No
bar.
BODIES
writhe on the strobe-lit dance floor. A heavy S&M scene. Leather.
Latex. Tattoos. Body-piercings.
A D.J. wearing head-mounted spotlights orchestrates the tunes on
twin- decks. MUSIC assaults us -- a beat so heavy it could jar the
fillings from your teeth. Brutal ""DARKCORE"" along the lines of
Prodigy or Underground.
Raquel pulls Dennis out onto the dance floor. They sway.
A lupine-featured GAULTIER GIRL with a streak of white running
through her raven hair moves in behind Dennis, pressing up against
him. Rachel Williams as the Angel of Death -- we'll call her MERCURY.
Mercury flicks her tongue against Dennis' ear -- it's been pierced
with a silver post which clicks against her teeth. Tattooed across
her back in black is a swirling, tribal vortex.
Dennis is now sandwiched between Raquel and Mercury, the three of
them dry-humping their way to every man's glory.
The beat gets LOUDER. The action heavier. The atmosphere more
narcotic. People are stripping off their clothes, sweating like
fiends. It's a virtual orgy.
Dennis laughs, reveling in the hedonism. Everything rises to a fever
pitch --"|stage direction
36||(over the music)|location
37|DENNIS|Fuck, I need a drink!!!|speech
38||"Raquel just smiles -- then Dennis notices a DROP OF SOMETHING spatter
his hand. It looks like blood. Dennis looks up, concerned --
-- MORE BLOOD DROPLETS are falling. Raquel's face is sprinkled with
them now. Dennis stops dancing. What is this? Some kind of fucked up
performance art?
Raquel turns her face toward the ceiling, as if washing herself in a
summer shower, now the other club goers are looking up too --
BLOOD SHOWERS DOWN
from sprinkler heads in the ceiling, drenching the dancers. The club
goers love it, thrusting their heads back, mouths open wide to
receive the crimson offering.
Horrified, Dennis recoils, turning towards --
RAQUEL,
whose face morphs into a preternatural snarl. Her canines extend,
tapering to razor-sharp points. Her tongue flicks, lizard-like as
fingernails sharpen into claws. All this while the whites of her eyes
BLEED RED, pupils oscillating hypnotically."|stage direction
39|RAQUEL|What's wrong, baby?|speech
40||"Dennis SCREAMS, pushes away from Raquel, only --
-- Mercury has fangs now too. In fact, everyone in the club does,
with the exception of poor Dennis. That's because they're all
vampires.
Dennis tries to run, but the burly Doorman blocks his exit, brutally
smashing his fist into Dennis' face.
Dennis falls, dazed. The club-goers close in around him. They make a
game of it, shoving him from one person to another, their pale faces
leering like twisted jack-o-lanterns.
The strobe lights quicken to a seizure-inducing intensity. Dennis
spins, tumbling into Raquel's arms. She shoves him forward -- Dennis
lands on the floor, falling at someone's boot-clad feet. He looks up.
A DARK FIGURE sits in the shadows, unnoticed until this moment. The
figure stands, moves into the light as time screeches to a halt --
A BLACK MAN,
towers above Dennis, wearing dark glasses and a leather longcoat -- a
sneer of cruel contempt etched upon a face tempered by a lifetime of
horror. His name is BLADE.
Blade whips open his long coat, shrugging it off, revealing an
arsenal of high-tech weapons strapped to his body:
6-point adjustable body armor, a modified CAR-15 assault rifle with
an ultra-violet entry light, two Casull .454 revolvers, a ""Demon""
automatic cross-bow, a bandoleer of mahogany stakes, an Indian-style
katar punching dagger -- and last, but certainly not least, his
namesake -- a silver sword which is secured in a back-scabbard.
CLOSE ON BLADE
A gaze as cold and pitiless as a midnight sun. The vampire club-goers
stare back. Nuclear silence. And then --
All hell breaks loose. With a SNARL, Raquel charges at Blade, moving
at superhuman speed, practically a blur --
Blade draws his Casulls, FIRES in multiple directions --
MACRO BULLET SHOT
as a round roars through the air towards Raquel. A silver-tipped dum-
dum bullet which explodes on contact.
WHAM! The round punches a fist-sized hole through Raquel's chest,
continuing on into the vamp behind her! Vampire blood fountains. Both
creatures tumble forward, their bodies liquefying into puddles of
black oil which go gurgling down the run-off drains.
Blade continues FIRING, then -CLICK!- magazines empty. Next. He
holsters the Casulls, swings up his assault rifle, calmly flicks on
the UV entry light mounted above --
MERCURY
leaps twenty feet straight up into the air. We've never seen anything
move so fast. She CRASHES through a glass skylight, disappearing into
the night just as --
-- a shaft of blinding UV ""sunlight"" cuts across the vampires. They
rear back, skin smoking from the light's corrosive effects. Blade
opens FIRE, pumping round after round of wooden fragmentation bullets
into the crowd -- vampire genocide.
The strobe lights flicker as the mayhem mounts. Some of the vampires
try to flee, scurrying up the stairs, but the exit quickly becomes
clogged with liquefying bodies --
-- then Blade's CAR-15 jams. The remaining club-goers see their
opening, surge forward en masse --
Blade drops the rifle, reaches over his shoulder and -SCHINGGG!-
unsheathes his sword with a double-handed grip.
THE SWORD
Four acid-etched feet of blood-soaked Damascus steel. An edge so
sharp it could cleave a shadow in two.
Blade moves like lightning, hacking his way into TWO CHARGING
VAMPIRES. Blade spins again, cuts ANOTHER VAMPIRE clean in half --
ON THE FAR END OF THE CLUB,
a LATEX-CLAD VAMP makes a break for it. Blade flings his sword,
sending it spinning end over end -- THUNK! The sword punches into the
vampire's heart. The hellish creature convulses, dies.
Beat. Blade retrieves his sword, then senses --
SOMETHING BIG
rising up behind him. In a flash, Blade swings his sword downward,
cutting off the vampire's right hand at the elbow. The severed limb
falls to the floor --
-- but it doesn't slow the hulking creature down. It SLAMS into
Blade. Blade flies backwards thirty feet, tumbling over tables,
slamming into the rear wall so hard that plaster rains down from the
ceiling.
Blade suddenly finds himself wrestling with a feral-faced six-foot-
something nightmare named QUINN. The vampire rears back its head,
jaws stretching wide. Every inch of his face is covered with ritual
scarification patterns and Maori-like tribal tattoos.
Blade forces an elbow against Quinn's throat, trying to keep him at
bay. With his other hand he reaches to his bandoleer, pulls out a
stake -- CRUNCH! Blade shoves the stake through the vampire's larynx.
Quinn gurgles, clutches at his throat.
Blade rolls out from under, unholsters the cross-bow secured to his
leg. With a flick of a switch the arms of the bow -SNAP!- open,
drawing the bow-string taut. Blade FIRES --
The bolt hits Quinn in the shoulder, throwing him backwards and
nailing him to the wall. As Quinn reaches over with his other hand to
pull out the stake --
Blade FIRES AGAIN. A second bolt slams into Quinn's other arm,
effectively pinning him like a butterfly to a board.
UP ABOVE,
mounted in one of the corners, is a security camera. Blade fires a
cross-bow bolt straight into the lens.
Blade strides over, placing his sword against Quinn's chest."|stage direction

47||"Quinn responds with a slew of rapid-fire vampire invectives. Blade
sees he's getting nowhere fast, calmly sheathes his sword. He unclips
a white phosphorous grenade from his combat harness --"|stage direction
48|QUINN|"You won't stop him, Blade. The Tide's
rising, the Sleeper's gonna --"|speech
49||"Blade shoves the grenade in Quinn's mouth, pulls the pin. WHOOSH!
Quinn goes up like a roman candle. Blade turns, surveying his work,
ignoring the howling pyre behind him:
All evidence of the vampires is gone -- with the exception of a few
oily-black puddles. Clothes, jewelry -- it's all been burned away by
the acidic process of the creatures' accelerated decomposition.
DENNIS sits huddled in a corner, having pissed his pants. As Blade
approaches, he cringes back --"|stage direction
50|DENNIS|Please don't --|speech
51||"Blade simply grabs Dennis by the jaw, tilting his head upward,
rotating it from side to side -- looking for bite marks. There aren't
any.
Blade moves on, leaving Dennis alone amidst the carnage. As Blade
starts up the stairs, he pauses in mid-step --
A COCKROACH
scurries out from underfoot.
Blade adjusts his footfall, sparing the roach. He continues on up the
stairs, disappearing in the smoky haze.

bow. The screen cuts to static.
A WITHERED, CLAWED HAND
moves into frame, holding a remote. With a tap of a button, the
monitor goes dark.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL a large, minimalist conference room -- the House
of Erebus, seat of the vampire race's legislative assembly.
Gathered around a massive table are the TWELVE VAMPIRE ELDERS,
representing a ""rainbow"" of racial colors -- names like PALLINTINE,
VON ESPER, ASHE, BAVA. Two of them, the FAUSTINAS, are identical
twins -- lethal-looking women with alabaster skin.
Chilled carafes filled with blood are situated along the table. From
time to time, a member will pour themselves a glass, or perhaps, help
themselves to the bowls of human finger bones which serve as snacks.
At the head of the table is GAETANO DRAGONETTI, current vampire
""Overlord"". Blood-red eyes, parchment skin stretched over skull-like
features. Incalculably ancient, but still deadly and virile as a
viper.
Dragonetti speaks. He uses the ""secret tongue"" -- the ancient vampire
language which utilizes consonants human vocal chords are incapable
of reproducing."|stage direction

daggers. Some of them wooden, their hilts inscribed with bizarre-
looking runes. In the center of these weapons rests --
BLADE'S SWORD,
hanging like a cross in a chapel, dominating all else. Karen touches
it. Then her eyes drop to a silver locket which dangles from the hilt

veins cording in his neck. He clutches Whistler's hand, holding it
tightly as he fights his way through the hellish seizure. To his
credit, Whistler never lets go.
Mentor and student stare at one another as the mysterious serum runs
its violent course. We understand that these shared moments, oddly
private in their horror, are the glue which binds the two vampire
hunters together. Finally, Blade slumps forward in his restraints,

triumph is short-lived, for now we hear --

behind. Karen hazards a look back --
THE VAMPIRES
surge down the tunnel like a pack of hungry wolves on high-octane.
There must be a dozen of them now and Quinn is right in the lead.

the train enters the next tunnel --

window, then lifts Karen up, helping her climb through into the
car --

on all fours, limbs a blur, claws striking the concrete and spewing
out sparks. Closing fast. Too fast.
QUINN
springs forward, snagging Blade's ankle with his ""good"" hand. The
vampire's weight threatens to haul Blade down. Blade reaches to his
back-scabbard, unsheathes his sword --
THUNK! Blade brings the sword down on Quinn's good arm, cutting it
off at the wrist! Quinn falls to the tracks, tumbling head over heels

falling to the side.
Karen crawls out from under its weight, swinging the femur again and

CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Karen pummels the howling horror, driving it
back until the femur actually splinters in half. The creature's head
hangs at an awkward angle now, its neck broken -- but still it
advances, dragging itself back up.
Sobbing, Karen retreats, clutching the splintered femur like a
makeshift dagger.
Curtis charges at her, a blur of slashing claws. At the last moment,
Karen ducks, thrusting the bone dagger up into Curtis' chest --
Curtis impales himself, right through the heart. For one split-

caustic vampire blood-bile, spattering Karen. She sinks to her knees,
GASPING, as the thing that used to be Curtis shrivels up, melting
away into burbling puddle.
After a beat, Karen rises and moves to the pit wall, running her
hands over the lichen-slick surface, searching for a way out. The
mortar between the brickwork is ancient, crumbling.
Karen looks to the ground, reaching for one of the splintered femurs.
She pounds it into the mortar between two bricks -- and it holds,
working as a makeshift piton.
Karen reaches for another broken femur, lodging it a foot above the
first. She hauls her body up now, suspending her weight from the two
makeshift pitons. Again, they hold.
Trembling from exertion, Karen pulls the right piton free, hanging
solely from her left hand now. Though her handhold is precarious, she

1242|FROST|"You're too late, Blade. I'm already
changing. Don't you see? The Sleeper
has awakened. I'm not just Frost
anymore. I'm becoming a god now,
blood incarnate."|speech
1243||"Even as Frost utters the words, his body begins to ripple and morph,
bleeding red, taking on the characteristics of liquid. He doesn't
walk so much now as flow. He's become a three-dimensional creature of
animated blood! A blood demon.
ON KAREN,
as she watches Frost's transformation, wide-eyed. She SEES Blade's
discarded sword, reaches for it -- suddenly, a SHADOW moves on the
periphery of her vision --
VANESSA
rushes at Karen in a near-blur. The SNARLING hellion is upon Karen in
an eye-blink, SLAMMING her down against the temple floor, pinning
her."|stage direction
1244|VANESSA|"Did you think I'd forgotten you, you
little whore?"|speech
1245||"BACK TO FROST,
who towers above Blade, swaying back and forth in his new, liquid-
like form."|stage direction
1246|FROST|You can't hurt me anymore.|speech
1247||"WHOOSH! Frost rises upwards on a spiraling column of blood, HOWLING
WITH LAUGHTER, then just as suddenly --
-- splashes back to earth, spreading out in a widening pool. In the
blink of an eye, he streams through Blade's feet, re-solidifying
behind Blade. Blade spins, swings his dagger --
Once again, Frost morphs into blood-form. He races around Blade in a
series of spouting arcs, turning from blood-form to solid and back
again in a series of split-second transformations.
Blade whirls, striking with his dagger and missing every time --
WHOOSH! Frost suddenly dissipates, SPLASHING away into a million
zero-G blood bubbles, vanishing. Blade spins, unnerved, trying to
pin-point his foe's next manifestation."|stage direction
1248|BLADE|Where are you?!|speech
1249||Frost's voice answers from all directions.|stage direction
1250|FROST|Everywhere.|speech
1251||"A DROPLET OF BLOOD
spatters the floor at Blade's feet. Blade looks up --
A SHOWER OF BLOOD
rains from above, coalescing into Frost as he sweeps down on Blade
like a giant bird of prey, crushing him against the temple floor."|stage direction
1252|FROST|You want my blood so much?! Take it!|speech
1253||"Frost's arms elongate and liquefy, flowing into two snake-like spouts
of blood -- the rest of Frost remains solid. The blood-spouts twist
around Blade's neck, melding together, completely encasing Blade's
head in a bubble of blood.
Blade claws at the blood-bubble as if it were a solid object that he
could dislodge, but his fingers just pass through it!
BACK TO VANESSA
as she wraps a hand around Karen's throat, choking her.
As Karen struggles, she frees a hand, sliding it down to her hip
pocket, digging something out -- Whistler's vampire mace canister!
She forces it up between them, triggering a jet of TOXIC MIST into
Vanessa's face --
Vanessa recoils, HOWLING, her head smoking as if it were doused with
formic acid, skin sloughing off from her skull. Karen lunges for
Blade's sword --
BACK TO FROST AND BLADE
Blade is drowning in Frost's blood. His eyes bulge. Oxygen bubbles
stream from his mouth. Frost leans in close, his face a twisted mask
of insanity."|stage direction
1254|FROST|"I was wrong about you, Blade. You were
never one of us. You're a traitor to
your race."|speech
1255|KAREN (O.S.)|Get away from him!|speech
1256||"Frost looks up -- Karen is wielding Blade's sword. She brings it down
on Frost, severing the blood-tendrils which envelope Blade. The
blood-bubble dissolves instantly, flowing away from Blade's face. He
gasps, chokes in air --
Frost backs away, horrified. His blood-tendrils don't reform.
Instead, the lay where they fell, solidifying into crystalline
powder."|stage direction
1257|KAREN|Blade!|speech
1258||"Karen flings the sword at Blade.
THE SWORD
spins end over end, its mirrored surface reflecting coruscating
pinwheels of candlelight as Blade catches the weapon by its hilt.
Blade rises, advancing on Frost, sword outstretched and Frost
retreats, uncertain now."|stage direction
1259|BLADE|"Guess you're not quite as invulnerable
as you thought."|speech
1260|FROST|"You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and
my transition will be complete. Even
your sword won't be able to affect me
then."|speech
1261|BLADE|You don't have a few minutes, Frost.|speech
1262||"Frost eyes Blade warily, then lunges towards Vanessa, sweeping behind
her. Blade follows, but even as he raises his sword to strike, Frost
spins Vanessa around, using her body as a shield!
Blade hesitates, stopping the sword in mid-strike, catching his
mother's gaze -- her face is monstrous now, scarred by Karen's
poisonous mace. Piteous, really.
Frost smiles, for he's found a final weakness of Blade's to exploit."|stage direction

1264|FROST|"Just as I thought. Still chained to
your mother's breast after all these
years."|speech

youthful vibrancy she possessed in the locket photo."|stage direction

this."|speech
1270||"Frost's eyes widen in shock, but he has no time to react, for --
Blade is already LUNGING forward, driving the sword-point through
Vanessa's chest, on into Frost's heart! It strikes the stone behind
them, SHATTERING and --
Frost and Vanessa HOWL AS ONE, their SCREAMS rising to an unendurable
intensity as the two vampires go nova, exploding into an expanding
ball of light and ATOMIZING BLOOD.
Blade is thrown back off his feet, having to shield his eyes from the
backlash of occult energy as a near tidal WAVE of blood surges over
him --"|stage direction

retrieving the hilt of his shattered weapon. At his feet --
THE SWORDBLADE

to pick it up."|stage direction

Blade's soul has won out? Human or vampire?
Then she SEES the tears rimming Blade's eyes, the first he's shed in
a lifetime. Human.
They embrace, holding each other that way for a long, long time. And
