promising as, well, this new day...
Sun is rising over...
A flat roof that stretches to the horizon. A vast expanse.
A plain of gravel-embedded tar, studded with...
HVAC units and power lines, the kind that service a huge
commercial building. In fact this kind of building...
A UNIMART store. A flagship of savings; a mother lode of
low, low prices. 100,000-and-then-some square feet of the
Consumer Economy..."|stage direction

LARRY CROWNE - A man as reliable (and predictable) as that
rising sun.
Actually, he's a Team Leader of this Unimart, dressed in his
un-sexy, un-fashionable, un-flattering khaki pants and
Company Polo.
Larry has had the ragtop down. He wrestles it up, locks the
cover into place.
He doesn't just walk to work, but s t r i d e s across the
asphalt field like a Sultan of Sales; a Viscount of Discount.
He cheers co-workers at the start of the day, shouting
encouragement, flashing thumbs up, knocking on car doors and
squeezing shoulders..."|stage direction
