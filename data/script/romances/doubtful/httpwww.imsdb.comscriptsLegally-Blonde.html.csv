2||"""HEAD OVER HEELS"" by the Go-Go's plays as we wind through a
flock of abstract, silky, golden strands -- PULLING BACK, to
discover that the strands are hair on a BLONDE GIRL's head.
But not just any blonde girl, a girl in Delta Gamma, the
blondest, most beautiful sorority at USC.
We PULL BACK further to see that she's signing a handmade
card. She holds it up ~ OVER HER SHOULDER, we see hearts
and glitter surrounding and ""Good Luck Tonight!"" and ""Elle
and Warner forever!.""
She carries the card out of her room and we FOLLOW HER across
the hall, into the room of --
THREE BLONDE CHEERLEADERS, who stop practicing their pom-pom
routine to sign the card. As they finish, we follow the Card
Girl out and into the room of --
A BLONDE GIRL IN A TANK TOP and shorts, working out on a
Stairmaster as ""General Hospital"" plays on a tiny TV. She
signs the card while continuing to exercise. We move on, to
the room of--
A BLONDE GIRL MAKING OUT WITH HER BOYFRIEND who stops long
enough to sign the card, as her boyfriend nibbles on her
neck. She hands the card back and we head into the room of --
A BLONDE PARTY GIRL who pours a pink frozen margarita into a
glass from the blender, then passes it down to ANOTHER BLONDE
GIRL, assembly-line style. The card goes one way, being
signed, as the drinks go the other.
Once the card arrives back in the Card Girl's hands, we
follow her out of the room and down the hall until she
reaches the very last and biggest door --
She puts a kiss mark on the card, then kneels down and slides
the card under the door."|unknown

UNDERDOG, a tiny chihuahua ~ who picks it up in his mouth
and trots it over to a pair of perfectly pedicured feet in
strappy sandals.
An equally perfectly manicured hand with a ""Sisters Forever""
charm bracelet dangling from the wrist, scoops up Underdog.

As he rises, we RISE WITH HIM, passing toned, waxed, tanned
legs in pink Prada pedal pushers and a pair of perky boobs
encased in a spaghetti-strap top -- until we finally reveal a
magnificent head of long blonde hair and a sweet, beautiful
face. This is ELLE WOODS, 21, the Goddess Queen of Delta
Gamma. She talks on a pink, fuzzy phone.
ELLE
(into the phone)
I love you, too!
Behind her, a ""Go USC"" banner is pinned to the pink wall. A
stack of ""Cosmopolitan""s and ""Glamour""s teeters on the
dresser. The closet overflows with trendy, designer clothes
in a predominance of pink.
ELLE (CONT'D)
(continuing; into phone)
I'll see you tonight.
She hangs up and lets out a squeal of joy, kissing Underdog's
head and taking the card out of his mouth. She reads it,
touched.
ELLE (CONT'D)
(continuing)
""Elle and Warner forever"". Aww...
Underdog yips.

A Delta Gamma/Sigma Chi barbecue in full swing. Beautiful
college students drink beer and mingle, trying to figure out
who they're going to sleep with next.
The main wall of the living room has been designated as a
""Model Wall"" of Delta Gamma girls -- ELLE smiles at us from a
Hawaiian Tropic ad and a Miss June USC calendar photo. A
cover of an Italian Vogue shows a blonde sexpot MARGOT; a USC
cheerleader poster displays a hard-bodied non-blonde SERENA
in a pom-pom pose.
Serena walks up, fending off an admirer.
SERENA
Jeremy, enough! I am not going to formal
with you.
Jeremy slinks off as Margot arrives, agitated.
MARGOT
Can someone please tell Rick that he is
not the only Sigma Chi with a big penis?

ELLE
Well, I don't want to look like I know

SERENA
I don't understand why you're completely
disregarding your signature color.
She holds up a tiny pink slipdress.
ELLE
He's proposing! I can't look like I

I can't wait to see you wearing The Rock!
Elle looks at them, suddenly concerned.
ELLE
Wh at if -- you know -- it's not the

MARGOT
Why else would he be taking you to The
Ivy? You've been dating for a year --
it's not like he's trying to impress you.
SERENA
Elle, you've heard the man pass gas in
his sleep. That practically means you're
pre-engaged.                                                  '""
The Saleswoman approaches with the dress, kiss-assy smile on
her face.
SALESWOMAN

Elle fingers the dress, then the new price tag, looking back
at the saleswoman, excited.
ELLE
Is this a low-viscosity rayon?

Uh, yes -- of course.

^       Elle hands the dress back to her, no longer pretending to be
excited.
ELLE
It's impossible to use a half-loop
topstitch on low-viscosity rayon. It
would snag the fabric. And you didn't
just get this in, because I remember it
from the June Vogue a year ago, so if
you're trying to sell it to me at full
price, you picked the wrong girl.
The saleswoman slinks off, embarrassed.
MARGOT
(to the saleswoman)
Nice try...
Elle shakes her head and turns back to the girls as she slips
on her Manolo Blahnik sandals, doing one last mirror check,
smoothing down her golden mane.
ELLE

Girls, this is it. In a few hours, I'll
be the future Mrs. Warner Huntington III.

ELLE
So when you said you'd always love me,
you were just ""dicking around""?
Warner looks around the restaurant nervously.
WARNER
I do love you, Elle. I just can't marry you.
You have no idea the pressure I ' m under. My
family has five generations of senators. My
brother is in the top three at Yale Law. He                ·
just got engaged to a Vanderbilt, for crissakes.
Elle stares at him aghast, tears streaming down her face,
then pushes her chair away from the table and walks out.

inch heels, sobbing. Warner pulls up alongside her in his
convertible Saab.
WARNER
C'mon.   Let me take you home.
ELLE
No.
WARNER
Elle -- it's twenty miles back to campus.
Elle stops, thinks a minute, then gets in, still crying.

Warner pulls up in front. It's a starry, romantic night.
Everything should be perfect. It's not.

What alibi?
BROOKE
I can't tell you.
'        DONOVAN
You understand you're on trial for
murder ?
BROOKE
I didn't do it! I walked in, saw my
husband lying on the floor, bent down to
check his heart, screamed my head off and
Chutney and Enrique ran inside.
DONOVAN
Where they saw you standing over the body
covered in his blood.
She glares at him.
BROOKE
Why would I kill my husband?
DONOVAN
Insurance? A love affair? Pure
unadulterated hatred? Believe me, the DA
will come up with plenty of reasons.

Marcinko, got a perm once. Even though we

weren't the right look for her --

curls were ruined when she got hosed
down?

cardinal rule of perm maintenance that
you are forbidden to wet your hair for at

your hair, as I suspect you were not,

And if you in fact, heard the gunshot,
then Brooke Windham wouldn't have had
time to hide the gun before you got
downstairs. Which would mean that you
would've had to have found Mrs. Windham

sound plausible. Isn't that right?"|unknown
