Rosenfeld we'd be living in Eastern

I see something in you, Irving. I

It's all from me. I want to change
things. I want to go after white
collar crime. Irving, you're very
skilled. And I want you to teach me
and we can do this. I want four
people that do what you do.
Fraudulent investments. Fake
certificates of deposit. Stolen
art, fake art. You get me four
people and you're off the hook.
