A hunting knife soars against the leafy sky.
BARRY grabs the knife-hand at the wrist.  The knife falls to
the mossy floor of the clearing.
Two hands go for the free blade.  BARRY's hand has it.
There is a confused jumble of struggle.

little slivers of lights admitted by the blade's chops.  ALICE's
eyes race around the larder to try to find a weapon, a defense,
anything...
Larger holes are now made.  MRS. VOORHEES stops just long enough
to take a peck inside.  We can see her eye at the largest hole.
She goes back to whacking away at the door.  The hole is near
the lock.  It is soon big enough for MRS. VOORHEES to reach
inside with her hand and turn the rachet.
ALICE realizes she must defend herself.  She reaches down and
picks up a heavy skillet and, as the door opens, ALICE raises
her weapon and, screaming, charges the woman who is trying to
come through the entrance.
MRS. VOORHEES chops down with the machete.  ALICE fends off the
blow with the skillet that she holds with both hands above her
head.  As the machete blade bounces off the skillet, ALICE is
able to swing the skillet downward and hit MRS. VOORHEES with
a solid blow on top of her head.  MRS. VOORHEES sprawls
sideways across the table and then collapses in a heap on the
floor.
ALICE raises the skillet again to strike.  She crosses
carefully to MRS. VOORHEES and pushes her gently with her foot,
the way she might poke a dead animal in the roadway.
ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES lies totally inert.  There is a
small puddle of blood under her head.
ANGLE ON ALICE:  She relaxes, puts down her weapon and crosses
slowly out of the room."|stage direction|||

up, foraging for food.
As the CAMERA scans the peaceful scene, we see the sky

1163||"ALICE lies, in MCU, in the canoe, sleeping.  She has not
changed her position since collapsing a few hours before.  The
water laps gently against the side of the canoe.  Very slowly,
she wakes.  She opens her eyes.
The canoe has drifted into the shade of some enormous tree
boughs that overhang the edge of the lake.
They shade ALICE from the bright rays of the sun.  The canoe
rocks gently.  ALICE is still, listening to the sound of the
lapping water.
Suddenly there is a blood-curdling scream, a MUSICAL STINGER,
and the screen is filled with the flying, whirling form of MRS.
VOORHEES, who leaps from the overhanging boughs into the canoe,
barely missing ALICE's slumped form!
The canoe immediately overturns and both MRS. VOORHEES and ALICE
try to find their footing in the shallow water.  MRS. VOORHEES
is covered in mud and blood.  She sees ALICE struggling to get
up and move toward her, brandishing her blood-spattered machete.
ALICE turns, sees MRS. VOORHEES coming.  ALICE grabs a paddle
floating near her.
MRS. VOORHEES pushes the canoe to one side, wading through the
waist-high water as fast as she can.  She screams with rage.
Her face goes through a horrifying transformation.  From her
mouth comes the VOICE OF JASON."|stage direction|||

who is slashing the air with her big knife trying to hit ALICE.
ALICE slips, falls in the water, gets her footing back and has
to turn and block the blow of the machete with the paddle,
using it like a staff to ward off the blow.  The machete cuts
the paddle nearly in half.  MRS. VOORHEES raises the knife for
another blow and ALICE lunges for her knees and succeeds in
throwing MRS. VOORHEES into the water.  The machete flies out
of her hand and lands in the water.  The two women roll in the
water.  MRS. VOORHEES is trying to strangle ALICE, her hands
stretching to reach around her throat.  They roll over and
under the water.  We cannot see who is winning.
Suddenly MRS. VOORHEES finds her footing and stands up, looking
for ALICE.  She is screeching madly."|stage direction|||
