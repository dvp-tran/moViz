distance."|stage direction
8|RODERICK (V.O.)|"My mother, after her husband's
death, and her retirement, lived in

son only, and for the memory of her
departed saint."|speech

10||Mother and son walking together.|stage direction
11|RODERICK (V.O.)|"My mother was the most beautiful
women of her day.  But if she was
proud of her beauty, to do her
justice, she was still more proud of
her son, and has said a thousand
times to me that I was the
handsomest fellow in the world."|speech
12||EXT.  CHURCH - DAY|location
13||Mother and son entering church.|stage direction
14|RODERICK (V.O.)|"The good soul's pleasure was to
dress me; and on Sundays and
Holidays, I turned out in a velvet
coat with a silver-hilted sword by
my side, and a gold garter at my
knee as fine as any lord in the
land.  As we walked to church on
Sundays, even the most envious souls
would allow that there was not a
prettier pair in the kingdom."|speech

16||A picnic.  The Dugan family.  Roderick.|stage direction
17|RODERICK (V.O.)|"My uncle's family consisted of ten
children, and one of them was the

19||"A sprawling run-down Irish manor house with large garden,
stables, barn and farm.
Idealized images of Dorothy."|stage direction
20|RODERICK (V.O.)|"Ah!  That first affair, how well one
remembers it!  What a noble
discovery it is that the boy makes
when he finds himself actually and
truly in love with some one!  A lady
who is skilled in dancing or singing
never can perfect herself without a
deal of study in private.  So it is
with the dear creatures who are
skilled in coquetting.  Dorothy, for
instance, was always practicing, and
she would take poor me to rehearse
her accomplishments upon..."|speech
21||Dorothy talking with the exciseman.|stage direction

his rounds."|speech

book."|stage direction

from Dugan's Town whom I recollect
beating once for that very reason."|speech

endure were horrible."|speech
31||EXT.  FIELD - DAY|location
32||"Dorothy, like a greyhound released from days of
confinement, and given the freedom of the fields at last,
runs at top-speed, left and right, back and forth,
returning every moment to Roderick.
She runs and runs until she is out of breath, and then
laughs at the astonishment which keeps Roderick motionless
and staring at her.
After catching her breath, and wiping her forehead, she
challenges Roderick to a race."|stage direction
33|RODERICK|"I accept, but I insist on a wager.
The loser must do whatever the
winner pleases."|speech
34|DOROTHY|Agreed.|speech
35|RODERICK|"Do you see the gate at the end of
the field?  The first to touch it
will be the winner."|speech
36||"They line up together and start on a count of three.
Dorothy uses all her strength, but Roderick holds back,
and Dorothy touches the gate five or six paces ahead of
him."|stage direction
37|RODERICK (V.O.)|"I was certain to win, but I meant to
lose to see what she would order me
to do."|speech
38||"Dorothy catches her breath, thinking of the penalty.  Then
she goes behind the trees and, a few second later, comes
out and says:"|stage direction
39|DOROTHY|"Your penalty is to find a cherry-
colored ribbon which I have hidden
somewhere on my person.  You are
free to look for it anywhere you
will, and I will think very little
of you if you do not find it."|speech
40||"They sit down on the grass.  Roderick searches her
pockets, the fold of her short bodice and her skirt, then
her shoes; then he turns up her skirt, slowly and
circumspectly, as high as her garters, which she wears
upon the knee.  He unfastens them and finds nothing; he
draws down her skirt and gropes under her armpits.  The
tickling makes her laugh."|stage direction
41|RODERICK|I feel the ribbon.|speech
42|DOROTHY|Then you must get it.|speech
43||"Roderick has to unlace her bodice and touch her pretty
breasts, over which his hand must pass to reach it."|stage direction
44|DOROTHY|Why are you shaking?|speech
45|RODERICK|With pleasure at finding the ribbon.|speech
46||EXT.  FIELD - DAY|location

mounted officers, a small military band, fifty local
people.
The Dugan family, Roderick and his mother, Captains Best
and Grogan.
Roderick admires the troops in their splendid uniforms."|stage direction
48|RODERICK (V.O.)|"About this time, the United Kingdom
was in a state of great excitement
from the threat generally credited
of a French invasion.  The noblemen
and people of condition in that and
all other parts of the kingdom
showed their loyalty by raising
regiments of horse and foot to
resist the invaders.  How I envied
them.  The whole country was alive
with war's alarums; the three
kingdoms ringing with military
music, while poor I was obliged to
stay at home in my fustian jacket
and sigh for fame in secret."|speech
49||INT.  BALLROOM AT FENCIBLES - NIGHT|location
50||Dorothy and Roderick entering.|stage direction
51|RODERICK (V.O.)|"Once, the officers of the Kilwangen
regiment gave a grand ball to which
Dorothy persuaded my to take her."|speech
52||"Several cuts depicting the evening.
Dorothy ignores Roderick; dances, chats, laughs, drinks
punch, and finally, strolls outside with Captain Best.
Roderick makes a half-hearted try at dancing with Miss
Clancy."|stage direction
53|RODERICK (V.O.)|"I have endured torments in my life,
but none like that.  Some of the
prettiest girls there offered to
console me, for I was the best
dancer in the room, but I was too
wretched, and so remained alone all
night in a state of agony.  I did
not care for drink, or know the
dreadful comfort of it in those
days; but I thought of killing
myself and Dorothy, and most
certainly of making away with
Captain Best."|speech
54||EXT.  FENCIBLES BALLROOM - DAWN|location
55||The guests leaving and saying their goodbyes.|stage direction
56|RODERICK (V.O.)|"At last, and at morning, the ball
was over."|speech

58||Dorothy and Roderick on horseback together.|stage direction
59|DOROTHY|"Sure it's a bitter night, Roderick
dear, and you'll catch cold without
a handkerchief to your neck."|speech
60||"To this sympathetic remark, from the pillion, the saddle
made no reply."|stage direction
61|DOROTHY|"Did you and Miss Clancy have a
pleasant evening, Roderick?  You
were together, I saw, all night."|speech
62||"To this, the saddle only replies by grinding his teeth,
and giving a lash to Daisy."|stage direction
63|DOROTHY|"Oh!  Mercy, you make Daisy rear and
throw me, you careless creature,
you."|speech
64||"The pillion had by this got her arm around the saddle's
waist, and gave it the gentlest squeeze in the world."|stage direction
65|RODERICK|"I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do!
And I only danced with her because
-- because -- the person with whom I
intended to dance chose to be
engaged the whole night."|speech
66|DOROTHY|"I had not been in the room five
minutes before I was engaged for
every single set."|speech
67|RODERICK|"Were you obliged to dance five times
with Captain Best, and then stroll
out with him into the garden?"|speech
68|DOROTHY|"I don't care a fig for Captain Best;
he dances prettily to be sure, and
is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He
looks well in his regimentals, too;
and if he chose to ask me to dance,
how could I refuse him?"|speech
69|RODERICK|But you refused me, Dorothy.|speech
70|DOROTHY|"Oh!  I can dance with you any day,
and to dance with your own cousin at
a ball as if you could find no other
partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain
Best's a man, and you are only a
boy, and you haven't a guinea in the
world."|speech
71|RODERICK|"If ever I meet him again, you shall
see which is the best man of the
two.  I'll fight him with sword or
with pistol, captain as he is."|speech
72|DOROTHY|"But Captain Best is already known as
a valiant soldier, and is famous as
a man of fashion in London.  It is
mighty well of you to fight farmers'
boys, but to fight an Englishman is
a very different matter."|speech
73||Roderick falls silent.|stage direction
74||EXT.  SMALL BRIDGE OVER A STREAM - DAWN|location
75||"They come to an old, high bridge, over a stream,
sufficiently deep and rocky."|stage direction
76|DOROTHY|"Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are
such a hero, was passing over the
bridge and the enemy on the other
side."|speech
77|RODERICK|"I'd draw my sword, and cut my way
through them."|speech
78|DOROTHY|"What, with me on the pillion?  Would
you kill poor me?"|speech
79|RODERICK|"Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd
do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river,
and swim you both across, where no
enemy could follow us."|speech
80|DOROTHY|"Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare
to do any such thing on Daisy.
There's the captain's horse, Black
George, I've heard say that Captain
Bes --"|speech
81||"She never finished the word for, maddened by the continual
recurrence of that odious monosyllable, Roderick shouts:"|stage direction
82|RODERICK|Hold tight to my waist!|speech
83||"And, giving Daisy the spur, springs with Dorothy over the
parapet, into the deeper water below.
The horse's head sinks under, the girl screams as she
sinks, and screams as she rises.
Roderick lands her, half-fainting, on the shore."|stage direction
84||INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY|location
85||"Various cuts showing illness and convalescence.
Roderick feverish:  the doctor taking his pulse.
Mother brings a tray of food."|stage direction

a fever, which kept me to my bed for
a week."|speech

quitted my couch still more
violently in love than I had been
ever before."|speech
89||EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY|location
90||"The air is fresh and bright, and the birds sing loud
amidst the green trees.  Roderick is elated, and springs
down the road, as brisk as a young fawn.
He encounters an orderly whistling ""Roast Beef of Old
England,"" as he cleans down a cavalry horse."|stage direction
91|RODERICK|Whose horse, fellow, is that?|speech
92|ORDERLY|"Feller, indeed!  The horse belongs
to my captain, and he's a better
fellow nor you any day."|speech
93|RODERICK (V.O.)|"I did not stop to break his bones,
as I would on another occasion, for
a horrible suspicion had come across
me, and I made for the garden as
quickly as I could."|speech
94||"Roderick see Captain Best and Dorothy pacing the path
together.  Her arm is under his, and he is fondling and
squeezing her little hand which lies closely nestling
against his arm.
Some distance beyond them is Captain Grogan, who is paying
court to Dorothy's sister, Mysie."|stage direction
95|RODERICK (V.O.)|"The fact is that, during the week of
my illness, no other than Captain
Best was staying at Castle Dugan,
and making love to Miss Dorothy in
form."|speech
96|CAPTAIN BEST|"No, Dorothy, except for you and four
others, I vow before all the gods,
my heart had never felt the soft
flame."|speech
97|DOROTHY|"Ah, you men, you men, John, your
passion is not equal to ours.  We
are like -- like some plant I've
read of -- we bear but one flower,
and then we die!"|speech
98|CAPTAIN BEST|"Do you mean you never felt an
inclination for another?"|speech
99|DOROTHY|"Never, my John, but for thee!  How
can you ask me such a question?"|speech
100||Raising her hand to his lips.|stage direction
101|CAPTAIN BEST|Darling Dorothea!|speech
102||Roderick rushes into view, drawing his little sword.|stage direction
103|RODERICK (V.O.)|"I pulled out a knot of cherry-
colored ribbons, which she had given
me out of her breast, and which
somehow I always wore upon me, and
flung them in Captain Best's face,
and rushed out with my little sword
drawn."|speech
104|RODERICK|"She's a liar -- she's a liar,
Captain Best!  Draw, sir, and defend
yourself, if you are a man!"|speech
105||"Roderick leaps at Captain Best, and collars him, while
Dorothy makes the air echo with her screams.
Captain Grogan and Mysie hasten up.
Though Roderick is a full growth of six feet, he is small
by the side of the enormous English captain.
Best turns very red at the attack upon him, and slips back
clutching at his sword.
Dorothy, in an agony of terror, flings herself round him,
screaming:"|stage direction
106|DOROTHY|"Captain Best, for Heaven's sake,
spare the child -- he is but an
infant."|speech
107|CAPTAIN BEST|"And ought to be whipped for his
impudence, but never fear, Miss
Dugan, I shall not touch him, your
favorite is safe from me."|speech
108||"So saying, he stoops down and picks up the bunch of
ribbons, which Roderick had flung at Dorothy's feet, and
handing it to her, says in a sarcastic tone:"|stage direction
109|CAPTAIN BEST|"When ladies make presents to
gentlemen, it is time for other
gentlemen to retire..."|speech
110|DOROTHY|"Good heavens, Best!  He is but a boy
and don't signify any more than my
parrot or lap-dog.  Mayn't I give a
bit of ribbon to my own cousin?"|speech
111||(roaring)|location
112|RODERICK|I'm a man, and will prove it.|speech
113|CAPTAIN BEST|"You are perfectly welcome, miss, as
many yards as you like."|speech
114|DOROTHY|"Monster!  Your father was a tailor,
and you are always thinking of the
shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I
will!  Roddy, will you see me
insulted?"|speech
115|RODERICK|"Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to
have his blood as sure as my name's
Roderick."|speech
116|CAPTAIN BEST|"I'll send for the usher to cane you,
little boy, but as for you, miss, I
have the honor to wish you a good
day."|speech
117||"Best takes off his hat with much ceremony, and makes a low
bow, and is just walking off, when Michael, Roderick's
cousin, comes up, whose ear has likewise been caught by
the scream."|stage direction
118|MICHAEL|"Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the
matter here?"|speech
119|CAPTAIN BEST|"I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan.
I have had enough of Miss Dugan here
and your Irish ways.  I ain't used
to 'em, sir."|speech
120||(good-humoredly)|location
121|MICHAEL|"Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make
you used to our ways, or adopt
English ones."|speech
122|CAPTAIN BEST|"It's not the English way, for ladies
to have two lovers, and, so, Mr.
Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the
sum you owe me, and I resign all
claims to this young lady.  If she
has a fancy for school-boys, let her
take 'em, sir."|speech
123|MICHAEL|Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.|speech
124|CAPTAIN BEST|I never was more in earnest.|speech
125||Best exits.|stage direction
126||(in a towering rage)|location
127|MICHAEL|"You -- you!  Hang you for a meddling
brat, your hand is in everybody's
pie.  What business had you to come
brawling and quarreling here, with
a gentleman who has fifteen hundred
a-year?"|speech
128||Michael runs after Best.|stage direction
129||(gasps)|location
130|DOROTHY|"Oh, I shall die; I know I shall.  I
shall never leave this spot."|speech

towards the house."|stage direction

yourself to the family."|speech

must first kill me -- do you mind
that?"|speech
140||(shouting back from|location
141||a distance)|unknown
142|MICHAEL|"Pooh, sir.  Kill you -- flog you,
you mean!  I'll send for Nick the
huntsman to do it."|speech
143|CAPTAIN GROGAN|"You are a gallant lad, and I like
your spirit.  But what Dugan says is
true.  It's a hard thing to give a
lad counsel who is in such a far-
gone state as you; but, believe me,
I know the world, and if you will
but follow my advice, you won't
regret having taken it.  Dorothy
Dugan has not a penny; you are not a
whit richer.  And, my poor boy,
don't you see -- though it's a hard
matter to see -- that she's a flirt,
and does not care a pin for you or
Best either?"|speech
144|RODERICK|"Dorothy might love me or not, as she
likes, but Best will have to fight
me before he marries her!"|speech
145|CAPTAIN GROGAN|"Faith, I think you are a lad that's
likely to keep your word."|speech
146||"He looks hard at Roderick for a second to two, then he
walks away, humming a tune, looking back at Roderick as he
goes through the old gate out of the garden.
When Grogan is gone, Roderick is quite alone, and he
flings himself down on the bench where Dorothy had made
believe to faint, and had left her handkerchief and the
ribbons and, taking them up, hides his face in them, and
bursts into a passion of tears."|stage direction
147|RODERICK (V.O.)|"I must have sat for some hours
bemoaning myself on the garden-bench,
for the dinner-bell clanged as usual
at three o'clock, which wakened me
from my reverie."|speech
148||EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY|location
149||"As Roderick passes the courtyard, he sees the Captain's
saddle still hanging up at the stable-door, and his odious
red-coated brute of a servant, swaggering with the
scullion-girls and kitchen people."|stage direction
150|MAID|"The Englishman's still there, Master
Roderick.  He's there in the parlor.
Go in, and don't let 'im browbeat
you, Master Roderick."|speech

big table; the butler speedily brings him a cover."|stage direction

That's right."|speech
154|AUNT|He'd better be home with his mother.|speech
155|UNCLE|"Don't mind her.  It's the cold goose
she ate for breakfast -- didn't
agree with her.  Take a glass of
spirits, Mrs. Dugan, to Roderick's
health."|speech
156||"It is evident that his uncle doesn't know of what
happened, but Michael, who is at dinner too, and Harry,
and almost all the girls, look exceedingly black and the
captain foolish; and Miss Dorothy, who is again by his
side, ready to cry.  Captain Grogan sits smiling, and
Roderick looks on as cold as stone.
His uncle is in high good-humor."|stage direction
157|UNCLE|"Dorothy, divide that merry thought
with the captain!  See who'll be
married first.  Jack Best, my dear
boy, never mind a clean glass for
the claret, we're short of crystal
at Castle Dugan; take Dorothy's and
the wine will taste none the worse.
Mrs. Dugan and ladies, if you
please; this is a sort of toast that
is drunk a great deal too seldom in
my family, and you'll please to
receive it with all the honors.
Here's to Captain and Mrs. John
Best, and long life to them.  Kiss
her, Jack, you rogue; for faith,
you've got a treasure."|speech

your tongue!"|speech

face this morning, Captain John
Best; he's already been called a
coward, Captain John Best; and this
is the way I'll drink his health.
Here's your health, Captain John
Best."|speech
163||"Roderick flings a glass of claret into his face.  The next
moment, he is under the table, tripped up by Harry, who
hits him a violent cuff on the head; as he goes down, he
hardly has time to hear the general screaming and
scurrying that is taking place above him, being so fully
occupied with kicks, and thumps and curses, with which
Harry is belaboring him."|stage direction

marplot -- you silly beggarly
brat --"|speech

166|HARRY|Hold your tongue!|speech

all gone; but he has the satisfaction of seeing the
captain's nose is bleeding, as his is -- Best is cut
across the bridge, and his beauty spoiled forever."|stage direction
168|UNCLE|"In Heaven's name, what does all the
row mean?  Is the boy in fever
again?"|speech

171|HARRY|"The fact is, sir, that the young
monkey has fallen in love with
Dorothy, and finding her and the
captain mighty sweet in the garden
today, he was for murdering Jack
Best."|speech
172||(bristling up)|location
173|CAPTAIN BEST|"And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan,
I've been insulted grossly in this
house.  I ain't at all satisfied
with these here ways of going on.
I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man
of property; and I -- I --"|speech
174|HARRY|"If you're insulted, and not
satisfied, remember there's two of
us, Best."|speech
175||"On which, the captain falls to washing his nose in water,
and answering never a word."|stage direction
176||(in dignified tone)|location
177|RODERICK|"Mr. Best may also have satisfaction
any time he pleases, by calling on
Roderick James, Esquire, of
Jamesville."|speech

Grogan joins."|stage direction
179|RODERICK|"Captain Grogan, I beg you to
understand that, for my cousin
Harry, who has been my best friend
through life, I could put up with
rough treatment from him; yet, even
that sort of treatment I will bear
from him no longer; and any other
person who ventures on the like will
not like the cost.  Mr. Best knows
that fact very well; and, if he's
man, he'll know where to find me."|speech
180|UNCLE|"It is getting late, and your mother
will be anxious about you.  One of
you had better go home with him."|speech

182|UNCLE|"Or the lad may be playing more
pranks."|speech
183|HARRY|Both of us ride home with Best here.|speech

man is armed, and so am I."|speech
185|HARRY|"You know the use of arms very well,
Best, and no one can doubt your
courage; but Michael and I will see
you home for all that."|speech
186|UNCLE|"Why, you'll not be home till
morning, boys.  Kilwangan's a good
ten miles from here."|speech
187|HARRY|"We'll sleep in Best's quarters.
We're going to stop a week there.
And, in another week, my boy."|speech

191||Grogan walks with Roderick.|stage direction
192|CAPTAIN GROGAN|"A pretty day's work of it you have
made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your
uncle to be distressed for money,
and try and break off a match which
will bring fifteen hundred a-year
into the family?  Best has promised
to pay off the four thousand pounds
which is bothering your uncle so.
He takes a girl without a penny -- a
girl that has been flinging herself
at the head of every man in these
parts these ten years past, and
missing them all, and a boy who
ought to be attached to your uncle
as to your father."|speech
193|RODERICK|And so I am.|speech
194|CAPTAIN GROGAN|"And this is the return you make for
his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you
in his house when your father died,
and hasn't he given you and your
mother, rent-free, your fine house
of Jamesville yonder?"|speech
195|RODERICK|"Mark this, come what will of it, I
swear I will fight the man who
pretends to the hand of Dorothy
Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into
the church, and meet him there.
I'll have his blood, or he shall
have mine.  Will you take my message
to him, and arrange the meeting?"|speech
196|CAPTAIN GROGAN|"Well, if it must be, it must.  For a
young fellow, you are the most
bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No
officer, bearing His Majesty's
commission, can receive a glass of
wine on his nose, without resenting
it -- fight you must, and Best is a
huge, strong fellow."|speech
197|RODERICK|"He'll give the better mark.  I am

horses, tieing them to the wheels and the pole in a

poor Chevalier, who is writhing like a dying dolphin on a

a mare, whose back was turned to him, take it into her
empty head to empty her bladder on him.  There is nothing

strength to hold in.
The chill wind and the silence are suddenly broken by an
attack, which is half-hearted and uncertain, by the lady's
lover, and his hesitant band of six cut-throats.
Some falter and run away as soon as Roderick fires his
pistol.
The leader and two heartier followers engage Roderick.
During the fight, they mortally wound the helpless
Chevalier and two of them are killed.
After they flee, Roderick kneels by the Chevalier, who
utters some appropriate last words, then dies.
His servant finally arrives at full gallop, shouting at

of annoyance.  For instance, I have
got the gout; who tends me?  A hired
valet who robs me whenever he has
the power.  My wife never comes near

woman.  Was she relenting at the

conduct showed it, as I came to
reflect on it.  It was my only

Cosgrove and her advisors to pay you
an annuity of 300 pounds a year,

remaining abroad out of the three
kingdoms, and to be stopped on the
instant of your return.  I advise
you to accept it without delay for
you know, as well as I do, that your
stay in London will infallibly
plunge you in gaol, as there are
innumerable writs taken out against
you here and in the west of England,
and that your credit is so blown
upon that you could not hope to
raise a shilling.  I will leave you
the night to consider this proposal,
but if you refuse, the family will
proceed against you in London, and
have you arrested.  If you accede, a
quarter salary will be paid to you
at any foreign port you should
prefer."|speech
