Dec 21st. Clear sky, snow on the ground. Cold as fuck. With
the sounds of laughter and music, we MOVE IN ON:
INT NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAY
An office Xmas party in progress, not a pretty sight: tipsy
receptionists laugh and spill drinks on the rug, red-faced
reporters loosen their belts and burp cocktail weiners...
MOVING QUICKLY THROUGH THE PARTY TO AN OPEN OFFICE DOOR.
Arriving just in time for the door to SLAM in our face.
INT OFFICE- DAY
A woman stomps back over to her desk and picks up her pen.
MEET CASSIDY DALEY (dirty blond, striking, manic energy). Ink-
stained fingers, notepads in every pocket: Cass doesn't have
time for office parties, she's working.
Her door cracks open and STEWART (almost as good looking as
he thinks he is) appears, holding a Kahlua bottle."|stage direction
2|CASS|I'm working, Stewart.|speech
3|STEWART|"Come on, take a break. (enticing)
I've got Kahlua..."|speech
4||"Cass picks up a stapler and LAUNCHES it at Stewart's head.
Stewart DUCKS OUT just in time. The phone rings. Answering:"|stage direction

over the phone? I could get killed.
Just meet me at the usual place.
Oh, and Cass? This one's gonna cost
an extra hundred."|speech

INT NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAY
Cass races for the elevator, Stewart hot on her heels:"|stage direction
14|STEWART|Where ya going?|speech
15|CASS|"Hooters. I go there for the hot
wings."|speech

my source."|speech
22|STEWART|"You know what? We need to talk
about our relationship."|speech
23|CASS|"We don't have a relationship. We
made out 3 years ago in the copy
room. I was drunk. I was broken-
hearted. I would have made out with
the xerox machine."|speech

25|CASS|I have to go.|speech

29||"EXT STREET/JERSEY CITY- DAY
Cass driving like a maniac, doing the one thing she loves:
TRACKING A STORY...
EXT DUNKING DONUTS PARKING LOT- DAY
MOVING IN ON- A BEAT-UP HONDA CIVIC (JIMMY'S CAR) IN THE BACK
CORNER OF THE LOT...
INT JIMMY'S CAR- DAY
JIMMY (20's, goatee, Mets baseball hat, nervous) sits in his
car, rolling a cigarette while he waits for Cass.
Jimmy puts the cigarette in his mouth and pulls out a
lighter. Just as he flips the lighter open, HIS FRONT
WINDSHIELD EXPLODES. A MAN HOLDING A TIRE IRON (MAHLER,
heavyset, crew-cut, rarely speaks, all business) reaches
through the broken window, AND DRAGS JIMMY OUT OF THE CAR...
EXT DUNKING DONUTS PARKING LOT- DAY
Cass drives into the lot and pulls up next to Jimmy's car."|stage direction

GLASS ALL OVER THE DRIVER'S SEAT."|stage direction
32||CASS|unknown
33|CASS|Jimmy?|speech
34||"SCREECHING TIRES behind her. Cass glances up and sees JIMMY'S
BASEBALL HAT IN THE BACK WINDOW OF A GREY CHEVY. The Chevy is
racing out into traffic. Cass throws her car into reverse...
INT CASS' CAR- DAY
Cass tries to follow the grey Chevy, but GETS STUCK AT A RED
LIGHT. Shit. She looks around, decides fuck it, and HITS THE
GAS. Her car leaps into the intersection. SIRENS."|stage direction
35||4.|unknown
36||"Cass looks into her rearview mirror: A PATROL CAR IS RIGHT
BEHIND HER, signalling for her to pull over. Up ahead, the
Chevy is getting away.
Cass debates: pull over? Or follow the story? No contest. SHE
SLAMS ON THE GAS AND HER CAR SURGES OUT OF FRAME...
EXT STREET- DAY
Cass' car SPEEDS down the street, A COP CAR IN CLOSE
PURSUIT...
INT CASS' CAR- DAY
Cass is losing sight of the Chevy. She races around traffic
and is suddenly HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE SIDE OF A MOVING VAN.
She panics, WRENCHING the wheel to the right...
EXT STREET- DAY
CASS' CAR JUMPS THE CURB, CROSSES A LAWN, AND SKIDS TO A HALT
ON THE FRONT STEPS OF A CHURCH. THE COP CAR RACES UP AND
BLOCKS HER IN.
EXT CHURCH- MOMENTS LATER
Cass is out of her car now, arguing with a cop who has her by
the arm:"|stage direction
37|CASS|"Let go of me, I'm a reporter, I'm
warning you..."|speech
38||"The cop pulls her towards his squad car. Cass leans over and
SINKS HER TEETH INTO THE COP'S HAND. The cop screams.
FREEZE FRAME.
CHIRON: ""24 HOURS LATER""
CLOSE ON- A NEWSPAPER COLUMN WITH CASS' PHOTO: windswept
hair, head tilted coyly, smile that says ""I'm on top of the
world. Beneath the photo, the byline: ""CASSIDY DALEY"".
Someone whistles ""We Wish You a Merry Xmas"" as a MARKER
improves on the photo: MOUSTACHE, BUCK-TEETH, PIMPLES. Then a
MATCH enters frame, and SETS THE PHOTO ON FIRE."|stage direction

INT CRYSTAL'S BAR/JERSEY CITY- LATE AFTERNOON
Holding the flaming photo, MEET MILO: rumpled shirt, messy
hair, looks like he slept on the floor. The bartender
(CRYSTAL, 50's, Eastern European) scowls at him:"|stage direction
43|CRYSTAL|What did I say about the fires?|speech
44|MILO|"You said ""please set fires in my
bar"". Wait, no, that's not right.
""Please don't set fires in my bar"".
(off her look) Ok, jeez, you try to
get in the holiday spirit..."|speech
45||"He drops the flaming photo to the floor, pours his drink on
it, then GRINDS IT TO PIECES WITH HIS SHOE."|stage direction
46|CRYSTAL|Shouldn't you be working?|speech
47|MILO|"That's the beauty of my job,
Crystal. Tracking down idiots is
something you can do pretty much
anywhere. See, there's one..."|speech

SINGING ALONG TO CHRISTINA AQUILLERA'S ""I AM BEAUTIFUL""."|stage direction

PARADE. Looks closer, recognizes someone, groans:"|stage direction

56||"EXT CRYSTAL'S BAR- LATE AFTERNOON
Milo climbs into a Cadillac: dents, patches of rust, cracked
windshield, bumper askew.
RACK TO: half a block away, A DARK SEDAN IDLES AT THE CURB.
INT DARK SEDAN- LATE AFTERNOON
The man behind the wheel (DWIGHT, large, babyfaced, Metallica
t-shirt) eats a hoagie as he watches Milo get into his car."|stage direction
57|DWIGHT|There you are, you dipshit.|speech
58||"He takes a last bite then tosses the sandwich and pulls away
from the curb, tailing the Cadillac.
EXT JERSEY CITY- LATE AFTERNOON
MOVE IN ON- the parade we just saw on TV. Baton twirlers in
Santa Hats. Men dressed like reindeer, pulling a sleigh. A
boys choir singing ""Joy to the World"", the kids dressed like
orphans that escaped a Broadway musical.
A beautiful scene, if you like that sort of thing.
RACK TO- the Cadillac, half a block away, cruising sideways
into a spot just beneath a ""TEMPORARY TOW-AWAY"" sign. MILO
climbs out of the car. Shoves his way through the crowd to
the curb, cracking open a can of Pabst.
Milo does not like this sort of thing. He scans the crowd
impatiently.
Meanwhile, THE CAR THAT WAS FOLLOWING HIM parks half a block
away. DWIGHT emerges and heads for:
MILO, who has just found what he's looking for. The reindeer
are passing him and he makes eye contact with RUDOLPH, who
does a double-take."|stage direction
59|MILO|"Yeah, you. Rudolph. Come here, you
fucking ding-dong."|speech
60||"Milo takes a step towards Rudolph and DWIGHT APPEARS IN
MILO'S PATH, BLOCKING HIM."|stage direction

64|DWIGHT|You owe my boss money.|speech
65||(LAUGHING)|location
66|MILO|Hey, I owe everybody money.|speech
67||"Suddenly, DWIGHT PUNCHES MILO IN THE GUT. Milo doubles-up,
gasping, then BRINGS HIS HEAD UP QUICK, CATCHING DWIGHT ON
THE CHIN. Dwight goes flying sideways and MEETS A POLICE
BARRIER FACE-FIRST. Ouch.
The barrier tips over, knocking over the one next to it. THE
REST GO LIKE DOMINOS. Milo turns to see that RUDOLPH HAS
DISAPPEARED. Then he catches sight of the ANTLERS, working
their way through the crowd. Milo lunges after him and
Rudolph drags other reindeer with him as he tries to avoid
Milo. THE SLEIGH FLIPS. Santa tumbles from the sled. PACKAGES
RAIN DOWN ON REINDEER LIKE SHRAPNEL.
All of a sudden, IT'S THE XMAS FROM HELL: BLOODY REINDEER
STUMBLING AROUND, SANTA UNCONSCIOUS IN THE GUTTER, KIDS
SCREAMING, PARENTS PANICKING. Meanwhile, MILO IS GAINING ON
RUDOLPH, who picks up one of the packages and throws it. IT
CRACKS MILO IN THE HEAD. Just what Milo has been waiting for:"|stage direction
68||(BEAMING)|location
69|MILO|I am so happy you did that.|speech
70||"Milo TACKLES RUDOLPH TO THE GROUND. Around them, people
scream and scatter. One boy bursts into tears:"|stage direction
71|BOY|That man is killing Rudolph!|speech
72||"SIRENS. Uh-oh. Cops SWARM the scene, surrounding Milo and
Rudolph, GUNS DRAWN. The LEAD COP (GELMAN, short, over-
zealous) steps forward:"|stage direction
73|GELMAN|Release the reindeer!|speech
74||"Release the reindeer? Milo looks around. He's got 8 or so
guns pointed his way and Rudolph gasping at his feet. MILO
STARTS TO LAUGH. Gelman bristles:"|stage direction
75|GELMAN|Hands behind your head, asshole!|speech

77|MILO|"Take it easy, skippy, I'm just
doing my job."|speech
78||Milo flashes his ID. Gelman inspects it, rolls his eyes.|stage direction
79|GELMAN|"Bounty hunter. Figures. Why don't
you get a real job?"|speech
80|MILO|"So I can be like you patrol boys
and sit around all day with my
thumb up my ass?"|speech
81||Gelman turns bright red.|stage direction
82|GELMAN|What did you just say?|speech
83||"Suddenly, a sergeant (BOBBY, late 30's, obnoxious but
likeable, Milo's ex-partner) marches onto the scene, takes
one look at Milo and laughs."|stage direction
84|BOBBY|Milo Boyd. I shoulda known.|speech
85|GELMAN|Sarg, you know this asshole?|speech
86|BOBBY|"Yeah. I know this asshole. Guy used
to be one of us."|speech

follows, shaking his head, bemused expression on his face."|stage direction
88|BOBBY|"Look, Milo, I know this is a tough
time of year for you..."|speech
89|MILO|"This isn't a tough time of year for
me. It's Christmas. Who doesn't
love Christmas?"|speech
90|BOBBY|"...and I try to be sensitive to
your situation..."|speech
91||9.|unknown
92|MILO|"What situation? Being a man who
works his own hours and has his
freedom and lives the high life?"|speech
93|BOBBY|"...because I realize you're
unhappy."|speech
94|MILO|"Unhappy? Are you kidding me, Bob?
Look at me: I'm the happiest man
alive."|speech
95||"Just then, they come to where Milo left his car. IT'S GONE.
Bobby squints at the huge ""TOW-AWAY"" sign:"|stage direction
96|BOBBY|That sign is pretty hard to see.|speech
97||And with that, Milo loses it:|stage direction
98|MILO|AAAHHH!|speech
99||"He rips the sign off the pole. Stomps on it. Kicks it. Tries
to shred it with his teeth. Hmm. He doesn't really seem like
the happiest man alive. Rudolph, to Bobby:"|stage direction
100|RUDOLPH|Take me to jail. Please?|speech
101||"INT BOBBY'S CAR- EARLY EVENING
Bobby's car is decorated with photos of his many children,
all of whom look exactly like him, even the girls, poor kids.
Milo's in front by Bobby, Rudolph's handcuffed in the back."|stage direction
102|BOBBY|"Ok, I got one for ya: why doesn't
Santa have any children? Cause he
only comes once a year and when he
does, it's down a chimney."|speech
103||Rudolph snickers. Milo does not. Bobby glances at Milo.|stage direction
104|BOBBY|So. Have you talked to her lately?|speech
105|MILO|Talked to who?|speech
106||"10.
BOBBY"|unknown
107|MILO|"Katie Couric, motherfucker, who do
you think?"|speech
108|MILO|"I haven't talked to her in three
years, why would I talk to her now?"|speech
109|BOBBY|"Well, for one thing, so you can
stop taking out your rage on
innocent bystanders."|speech

111|RUDOLPH|Talk to her, man. For real.|speech

shit will eat a hole in your
intestines, you don't deal with it."|speech

back. Bobby leans out."|stage direction
115|BOBBY|"Hey, why don't you come by the
precinct tomorrow for our Xmas
bash?"|speech
116|MILO|"I'm not invited. I'm not a cop
anymore, remember?"|speech
117|BOBBY|Fuck that, I'm inviting you.|speech
118|MILO|I don't know, Bob. I'm sorta busy.|speech
119|BOBBY|"That's what I'm worried about.
(sighing) Just...take it easy, Ok?"|speech
120||"Bobby really seems worried, but Milo waves him off. Bobby
drives over, parks by other cop cars. Gets out, mingles with
some cops. Laughter, inside jokes. Milo watches from afar."|stage direction

122|RUDOLPH|"You should go to that party, man.
Seriously. You need it."|speech
123|MILO|"Do I look like I need advice from a

126||"INT SID'S BAIL BONDS/JERSEY CITY- MORNING
Hazy pieces: a tilting clock on the wall. A battered metal
desk. Filing cabinets, spitting up papers. A man, SID (wound
sorta tight, Milo's best friend) peers down at us:"|stage direction
127|SID|You're drooling on my sofa.|speech
128||"Milo unsticks his face from the leather couch, wobbles
upright. Are the walls throbbing, or is it just him?"|stage direction
129|SID|"You do have an apartment, don't
you? With a bed of some kind?"|speech
130||Milo grunts. Sid hands him a coffee.|stage direction
131|SID|"Heard you shut down 5th Street
yesterday. Gave every kid in the
county the gift of nightmares."|speech
132|MILO|"Hey, I'm a giving kind of guy.
Anyway, what do you care? I brought
your guy in, right?"|speech
133||"Milo holds out his hand, palm up. Sid COUNTS MONEY INTO HIS
PALM.
EXT SID'S BAIL BONDS/JERSEY CITY- MORNING
Swearing under his breath, Sid is trying to stuff a Xmas tree
into the back of a station wagon. At least half of the tree
is hanging out of the back. Milo drinks a beer and watches."|stage direction
134||12.|unknown
135|SID|"You gonna give me a hand, or just
stand there killing your liver?"|speech
136|MILO|Is that a trick question?|speech
137||"Sid glares at him. Milo sighs, puts down his beer, and grabs
part of the tree."|stage direction
138|SID|"So I told her, fine, I'd handle
Xmas this year. I mean, what's to
handle? You buy a tree, some gifts,
cook a ham, hang some lights. An
idiot could do it."|speech
139|MILO|Well, we'll soon find out.|speech
140||Sid checks him out.|stage direction
141|SID|You have plans for the holiday?|speech

put your fist through a wall?"|speech

Sid pulls out a small hand saw."|stage direction
148|SID|Then forget it.|speech
149|MILO|Forget what?|speech
150|SID|"I've got an open bond, but your
thing sounds like more fun. I'll
give it to Doug instead."|speech

fuck. I want the job, I'm in the
hole."|speech
154|SID|You're always in the hole.|speech
155|MILO|What's your point?|speech
156||(SIGHING)|location
157|SID|"The truth is, I'm not sure you're
the right person for this job. It
could be a total disaster. On the
other hand, when one friend sees
another friend stagnating in his
own filth, he has to do something,
right?"|speech
158|MILO|"Hey. I just woke up. I was gonna
shower."|speech
159||"Sid drops the saw. With one final shove, the tree is in.
Phew. Sid slams the back shut."|stage direction
160|SID|Ok. But remember: you asked for it.|speech

PAPER. Hands it to Milo. Milo unfolds it, gives it a quick
look. A second look. A third.

I'm gonna have to kill you."|speech
170|SID|It's not a joke.|speech
171|MILO|"She got arrested? And then she
jumped bail?"|speech
172|SID|"Apparently the whole thing started
with some reckless driving, and
ended with her assaulting a police
officer."|speech
173||Milo gives him a questioning look.|stage direction
174||(EXPLAINING)|location
175|SID|She bit him.|speech
176||Milo snorts.|stage direction
177|MILO|"Yeah. That sounds like her.
But here's my question: why the
hell did you post her bail?"|speech
178|SID|Hey, I know she dumped you...|speech
179|MILO|"Whoa. She did not ""dump me""."|speech
180||(QUICKLY)|location
181|SID|Ok, whatever, I...|speech
182|MILO|"No, not ""whatever"". I dumped her."|speech
183|SID|"The point is, I'm aware you guys
have issues, but I'm running a
business here. A person needs bail,
I don't have time to check with you
first."|speech
184|MILO|"Well, had you checked with me
first, you wouldn't be out of a
bond right now."|speech
185||15.|unknown

pick her up. It's five grand to
bring her back by 9am, Xmas day."|speech

to go pick up my ex-wife and bring
her to jail. (beat) On Xmas."|speech
189|SID|You're a good listener.|speech
190||"Milo takes a deep, calming breath. Then he EXPLODES into
whoops and hollers. He throws himself into a snow bank and
thrashes around. He does a Fred Astaire around a lamp post."|stage direction

a guy could ever have!"|speech

KISS. He releases her. She stumbles back a bit."|stage direction

199|MILO|Right. Sorry.|speech

her. She retreats back inside. Milo beams at Sid."|stage direction

Karma! Payback! You know how they
say ""What goes around comes
around""? Turns out it's true!"|speech
202||16.|unknown
203|MILO (cont'd)|"(checking the paper) That middle
initial stands for Rhonda, by the
way. She tells people it stands for
""Rachel"", but that's a lie."|speech
204||Sid shakes his head.|stage direction
205|SID|"I can't believe you guys broke up
over a stupid article."|speech
206|MILO|"We didn't break up over a stupid
article. We broke up because she is
a cheating, manipulative liar."|speech
207|SID|Are you sure you can handle this?|speech
208|MILO|"Why wouldn't I be able to handle
this?"|speech
209|SID|"Let's face it: you're not exactly
rational around her. I mean, if I
was a cop working a case and some
reporter came snooping around, I'd
say ""no comment"". Not ""no comment,
but care for a cocktail""? And then
a month later, running off to some
love shack called ""Caveman's Cabin""
and tying the knot? Who does that?"|speech
210|MILO|"That's not even close to what
happened. For one thing, it was
called ""Cupid's Cabin"". And for
another, that was before I knew how
conniving she was. Now I know. So
all I have to do is track her down,
cuff her up, and bring her in.
(checking his watch) And I've got,
what, two days? Shit, man. Easy as
pie."|speech
