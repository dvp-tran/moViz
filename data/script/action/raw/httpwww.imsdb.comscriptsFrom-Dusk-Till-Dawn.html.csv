be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this
friendly. But you're right, enough
with the getting to know you shit.
Now, there's two ways we can play this
hand. One way is me and you go round
an' round all fuckin' night. The other
way, is we reach some sort of an
understanding. Now, if we go down that
first path at the end of the day, I'll
win. But we go down the second, we'll
both win. Now, I don't give a rat's
ass about you or your fuckin' family.
Y'all can live forever or die this
second and I don't care which. The
only things I do care about are me
that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and
our money. And right now I need to get
those three things into Mexico. Now,
stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it
you don't give a shit about seeing me
and my brother receiving justice, or
the bank getting its money back. Right
now all you care about is the safety
of your daughter, your son and
possibly yourself. Am I correct?"|speech
564|JACOB|Yes.|speech
565|SETH|"I thought so. You help us get across
the border without incident, stay with
us the rest of the night without
trying anything funny, and in the
morning we'll let you and your family
go. That way everybody gets what they
want. You and your kids get out of
this alive and we get into Mexico.
Everybody's happy."|speech

567|SETH|"Jesus Christ, Pops, don't start with
this shit."|speech

passive. The only way being passive in
this situation makes sense is if I
believe you'll let us go. I'm not
there yet. You have to convince me
you're telling the truth."|speech

need to be convinced about is that
you're stuck in a situation with a
coupla real mean motor scooters. I
don't wanna hafta worry about you all

wanna be worrying about my brother's
intentions toward your daughter all

I'm willing to make a deal. You
behave, get us into Mexico, and don't
try to escape. I'll keep my brother
off your daughter and let you all
loose in the morning."|speech

The crowd hushes up.
And on the stage steps SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM.
This Mexican goddess is beautiful, but not the beauty that
Stendhal described in ""As the Promise of Happiness,"" but
the beauty of the siren who lures men to their doom.
She dances to the raunchy music, not like she owned the
stage, but like she owned the world.
And if the patrons of the Titty Twister are her world, the
world is proud to be her possession.
All activity in the bar, save Santanico, stops. Even the
Fuller/Gecko table falls under her spell. Especially
Richard, Scott and Kate. Seth knows this song and
accompanies from the table with the guitar.
When the music builds to its explosive section.
Santanico LEAPS from the stage, LANDING in the middle of the

She does an eyes-closed voodoo dance in perfect step with
the beat. As the music continues to play, a very fucked-up
looking Chet Pussy walks in. He goes over to Razor Charlie

Santanico scans the table, zeroing in on our boy Richard.

this woman has over a man she's deathly feared.
Seth laughs out loud a Mexican ""yi yi yiii"" laugh, keeping
the beat with his guitar.
Across the room, Razor Charlie, Chet by his side, motions
over Big Emilio. He begins explaining with pointing what
Seth and company did to Chet.
Richard continues to suck her toes.
The song ends, Santanico extracts her foot from Richard's
mouth. Steps off the table. Takes a drink of whiskey. Looks
down at the seated Richard.
She GRABS the back of his hair, YANKS his head BACK. His
mouth OPENS because she's hurting him. She LEANS her FACE
OVER his like she's going to kiss him. Then let's the whiskey
from her mouth fall into his. They never touch. The crowd
applauds. She lets go of Richard's hair. Except for Jacob

hair a toss back. Seth, moving backwards, is terrified.
Santanico gives Seth a SWINGING ROUND HOUSE PUNCH to the
JAW, that sends him FLYING over a table, SLIDING ACROSS the
FLOOR and INTO the WALL.
A bad-ass biker named FROST, with a hideous burn on the
side of his face, stands on top of a pool table, swinging a
pool cue, left to right, fending off vamps.
Big Emilio picks up a biker who stabbed him with a
switchblade and throws the poor bastard from one end of the
bar to the other.
The biker-winner of the bare knuckle fight, SEX MACHINE,
goes head to head with a stripper.
The vamp might have superhuman strength, but Sex Machine has
close to superhuman strength, and he's matching the
vamp bitch blow for blow.
Then he GRABS her by the waist, LIFTS her up over his head
and BRINGS her DOWN HARD on an upturned table, IMPALING her
on the wooden leg.
FROST is still swinging his POOL CUE, when Razor Charlie
appears, straight razor in hand.
Frost JUMPS off the table to meet the challenge. Razor
Charlie SWINGS at him, Frost LEAPS back, SWINGING his pool
cue at him. They do this dance, till Frost CRACKS Charlie
UPSIDE the HEAD with the pool cue, breaking it in half.
Charlie FEELS the HIT. Frost PLUNGES the splintered end of
the cue in Razor Charlie's heart.
Green blood comes out of his chest, as Charlie screams the
vampire's death scream.
Seth comes to and finds Santanico standing over him. He
tries to rise, but Santanico places her bare foot on his
chest, pinning him down to the floor. He tries to move, but
the pressure of her foot is equivalent to an engine block
placed on his chest."|stage direction

Santanico, bathed in whiskey and broken glass, is
momentarily dazed. She looks down at Seth.
Seth sits up, .45 in hand, and fires.
Santanico is HIT in the CHEST. The bullet from the gun makes
the liquor-soaked robe ignite.
Santanico SCREAMS as she GOES UP IN FLAMES.

him, with a QUICK SWING of his hand the trucker is brushed
aside, receiving a broken neck for the effort.
Big Emilio never breaks his stride or takes his eyes off
Seth and Jacob.
Seth and Jacob both grab pieces of wood, holding it like a
weapon, but the wood looks puny compared to their opponent.
Big Emilio stands in front of them. The two men hold their
wood tight. Fangs grow in Big Emilio's mouth that make him
look like a huge walking shark.

Sex Machine stands his ground waiting for IMPACT. The two
huge men COLLIDE. What follows is literally a war of the
Gargantuans. The two mastiffs POUND each other till one
buckles. Finally, the one who buckles first is Big Emilio,
who HITS the floor.
Once on the floor, Seth and Jacob, stand over the huge vamp,
BEATING him with clubs and pipes, like L.A.'s finest. The
vamp can do nothing except SQUIRM on the floor from the
savage beating."|stage direction

Sex Machine holds a pool cue in his hand. He SNAPS off the

vamp.
Chet Pussy spies Ms. Apple Pie Pussy herself, Kate. He
breaks into a lecherous grin and licks the blood from

up back into his head. Scott SLAPS Chet hard on the back.
GULP.
Chet has swallowed the crucifix. A SIZZLING sound is heard
moving down from his throat to his belly. He opens his
mouth and lets out a noise similar to a train whistle. He
jumps up from behind the bar, doing a wild dance from pain.

staked, Chet lets out a sigh of relief.
By this time there are not too many people left. Most of the
vampire have been killed by wooden stakes and most of the
customers have been butchered or drained.
All that's left on the vampire side are two naked dancers
and two whores. On the human side are Seth, Jacob and his
kids, Sex Machine and Frost. Aside from the children, who
are hiding behind the bar, all the humans are holding
wooden stakes.
The four human men group together. The four female vampires
charge, teeth exposed, snarling and dripping with blood.
Seth, Jacob, Sex Machine and Frost raise their weapons and
slam, almost simultaneously, the four vamps. All four
staked bodies hit the floor.
Kate and Scott run from behind the bar to their father's

The survivors are opening boxes and prying open crates. A
lot of what they find is bullshit. Pantyhose, coffee,
teddy bears, etc. But a few of the boxes are just what the
doctor ordered. Cases from a sporting good supplier yield
a shipment of baseball bats. Meant to arrive at toy stores
are a shipment of Uzi replica squirt guns and a box of
balloons. And captured en route to a hardware store are
shipments of power tools, saws and jack hammers.
Seth and Scott saw the bats into wooden stakes.
Kate fills the Uzi squirt guns with tap water from the
backroom sink.
Jacob, with Seth's knife, etches a cross into every bullet
in the .45 automatic's last full clip of ammo.
Vampires all start converging on the back room door,
getting their courage back.
Kate makes water balloons.
Scott sharpens the stakes to a point with the tools. Seth
attaches a wooden stake to the end of a jackhammer.
Jacob blesses the water in the squirt guns and balloons,
turning it into holy water.
Our heroes work together, preparing for the battle to come.
The back room door, barricaded with crates and boxes,
