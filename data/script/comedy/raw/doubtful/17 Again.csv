seen anything so perfect. I
remember thinking I had to have you
or I'd die...not in a psycho kinda
way but in that beautiful,
innocent, unaffected way that way
only a 17 year-old kid can have.
You whispered you loved me at the
homecoming dance and I felt so
peaceful and safe because I knew no
matter what happened from that
night on nothing could ever be that
bad because I had you. And then I
grew up, lost my way and blamed you
for my failures. But I was never
lost. I'd just forgotten the way
life makes you forget as you grow
older. And I never failed at
anything because on that September
day you said `yes' to me. And at
that dance you said you loved me.
And as I stand here...as I write
this, I want you to know if I don't
have you I'll die...not in a psycho
way but in that beautiful,
innocent, unaffected way only a 17
year old kid can have....oh
