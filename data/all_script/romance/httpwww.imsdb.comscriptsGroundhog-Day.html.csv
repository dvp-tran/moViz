volumes about it's inhabitant-- team pictures of the Steelers

on the desk, ^windowsill, and every other available surface.

sofa, buried deep under a pile of coats and a stolen airline
blanket.
GIL HAWLEY, Executive Producer of the Action News, sticks his
head in the door."|stage direction

It's Phil, the .Channel 9 Action News weatherman."|stage direction

a genuine princess, though Phil is too self-absorbed at this

of personal items in an overnight bag, all the time watching
himself on the TV monitor."|stage direction

a long moment. There is something vaguely off-center about

scary."|stage direction

Suddenly, a BRIDE in full white wedding gown and veil rushes

the Knob, gesturing for her to follow.
Larry shakes his head as Rita charges through the crowd toward

155|"Phil points to the hole and Larry zooms in.
The groundhog sticks his head out, looks left, looks right,
steps out of the hole, and runs away from the press pool,
directly over to Larry's camera. As he stands there, his body
casts a long shadow. The groundhog looks right into the
camera, lets out a squeak, and runs back into the hole.
Rita and Larry are completely amazed as the crowd cheers the
brief appearance of the groundhog. Larry pans back to Phil.
Phil just stands there speechless, staring at the groundhog
burrow."|stage direction

174|"Phil, has demolished just about all the furniture and woodwork
in the room. He rips off the last of the wooden moldings with
the crowbar, then crosses to the mirror over the demolished
sink.
Phil stands there, staring at his image in the mirror, trying
to figure out what's happening to him. He starts breathing
heavier, as if gathering courage, then, just when we think he's
going to cut off his ear or something, he raises an electric
barber clipper and shaves a bald stripe up the middle of his
head. He studies his new look for a moment then smashes the
mirror with his sledgehammer.
Then he opens the cans of paint, dips the two big brushes into
the cans and starts slapping bright red paint onto the walls,
madly, feverishly, splashing himself and everything else in the
room with it.
As a final touch he grabs the bed pillows and rips them open,
then shakes them all around the room creating a storm of
feathers.
Finally, Phil falls exhausted on the bed. From outside we can
hear outraged hotel employees pounding on the door.
We pan over to the clock radio, the only undamaged object in
the room. Feathers drift down past the face of the clock which
reads 5:59 AM. The time changes to 6:00, the radio clicks on
and ""I Got You, Babe"" starts playing as we pan back to Phil
sleeping on the bed.
He opens his eyes, jumps out of bed and looks around. No
paint, no feathers, no damage. Everything is as clean and tidy
as the day he checked in.
He races over to the unbroken mirror and looks at himself. His
hair is completely restored, as if it had never been shaved.
The song ends and the deejays come on. Phil says every word
right along with them, shocked into a state of complete
wonderment."|stage direction
