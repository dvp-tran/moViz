private WORLD OF PAIN.
Behind him we see a woman in a fur collard coat and flowered
hat walking, gaining on him. This is JEANNE (20's).
As she PASSES Paul, she turns to GLANCE at him. We read a
HINT of EMPATHY on her face.
He is OBLIVIOUS to her or anything else for that matter.
She walks on, dodging STREET SWEEPERS as she covers the long
walkway, trying to forget the SAD MAN she saw.
We see her walk toward a 6 story APARTMENT BUILDING.
Paul, with TEARS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE, comes to reality as
he also notices the building. He REGARDS it."|stage direction

room was the double of ours. And
you know what? I didn't even have
the guts to ask him. Didn't have
the guts to ask him if the same
numbers you and I did were the same
numbers you did with him. Our
marriage was nothing more than a
foxhole for you. And all it took
for you to get out was a -cent
razor and a tub full of water. You
cheap, goddamn, fucking,
godforsaken whore. I hope you rot
in hell. You're worse than the
dirtiest street pig anybody could
find, and you know why? You know
