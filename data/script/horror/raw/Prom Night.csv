1||EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY|location
2|FADE IN:|"SUPER: April 27, 1973
All is quiet outside this suburban school on a sunny
Friday afternoon. Cars idle in the driveway awaiting
the three o'clock onslaught of liberated children.
Two faded yellow buses stand ready.
The lull is shattered by the CLANGING of the final BELL.
A swarm of children pours out the door and down the
broad front steps, scattering across the lawn toward
the cars and the buses.
Moving slowly through the crowd, ROBIN and ALEX HAMMOND,
nine-year-old identical twins, appear at the doorway..
Attractive, dark-haired children, they seem more sub-
dued than the others. As they walk quietly down the
stairs, Robin lags behind, staring at a boy teasing a
girl nearby. He is NICK MCBRIDE, eleven years old,
two grades ahead of Robin and the most popular boy in
school. The pretty girl laughing at his antics is KIM
HAMMOND, also eleven, Robin's older sister."|speech

the young couple)

by ourselves."|speech

Robin is staring at Nick. Alex looks, understands.
He's angry."|speech

(CONTINUING)"|You're crazy, I'm not waiting.|speech

CONTINUED :"|"He strides away. Robin's eyes remain on Nick and Kim.
Nick says something to Kurt. She shakes her head and
pains toward Robin. Robin quickly turns away as they
look at her.. When she glances back, Ki_m is walking
towards her and Nick is bicycling away."|speech
10|KIM|"Okay, let's go.
The sisters start to walk across the lawn."|speech
11|ROBIN|Y-you 1-1-like him?|speech
12|KIM|Who?|speech
13|"ROBIN
(SMILES SHYLY)"|Y-you know.|speech

They walk on in silence with Robin stealing glances at
her big sister."|speech
15|"ROBIN
(FINALLY)"|Are y-y-you g-gonna m-in-marry him?|speech
16|KIM|"Robin?
Robin smiles and takes Kim's hand. They walk along the
road, kicking rocks and swinging their bookbags. Sud-
denly Kim halts."|speech
17|"KIM
(CONTINUING)"|"Oh, damn!
Robin looks up in surprise."|speech
18|"KIM
(CONTINUING)"|"Debbie was gonna lend me her new
record. Look, you go on home
by yourself. Tell Mom I'll be
a little late.
Before Robin can reply, Kim is hurrying away."|speech

CONTINUED! (2)
Robin watches her go, then moves off alone, breaking
into a skip and playing imaginary hopscotch.
As she turns off the main road into a side street,
Robin passes a construction site. The empty skeleton
of a half-finished apartment building looms up above
the dark shade trees. Hearing VOICES, Robin stops to
investigate."|speech
20|"ROBIN
(CALLS OUT)"|"Alex?
The VOICES continue. Robin moves closer, peering
through the tall bushes surrounding the lot. She
sees Nick playing in.the framework with three of his
classmates. Robin recognizes JUDE CUNNINGHAM, and
KELLY LYNCH as Kim's two best friends. The fourth
child, WENDY RICHARDS, is a dark-haired girl, domin-
eering and loud. As Robin watches, Wendy jumps
up onto the floor of the building."|speech
21|WENDY|"I want to play 'Murder.' Who's
the killer?"|speech
22|NICK|You, Wendy!|speech
23|"JUDE
(GIGGLING)"|you, Nick.|speech
24|KELLY|Yes, Nick!|speech
25|"WENDY
(LAUGHING)"|"You'll never catch me. Hide your
eyes, killer!
As Nick turns his back, hiding his eyes against an ex-
posed beam, the children scatter through the structure.
Robin watches with mounting excitement as Nick finishes
counting, and whirls around."|speech
26|NICK|"The killer is coming for you!
He moves into the building, chanting ""Kill, kill.,"" in a
low monotone. As he disappears from view, Robin cau-
tiously edges out of the bushes and moves up to the
building.
NICK (O.S.
The killer strikes!"|speech

her. Immediately Jude's VOICE TAKES UP the ""kill""
chant in unison with Nick."|speech
30||INT. APARTMENT BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY 2|location
31|1 CONTINUED; (3) I|"Robin climbs up onto the floor and peers into the dark,
gloomy structure. Suddenly, she hears a SHRIEK. Ter-
rified, she backs against a wall. LAUGHTER FOLLOWS im-
mediately and Robin hears Kelly's VOICE TAKING UP the
chant. As the three ""killers"" move through the vast
structure searching for Wendy, ""KILL, KILT"" ECHOES off
the walls and hardwood floors.
Robin cautiously steps out of the doorway into the im-
mense unfinished lobby. Ominous shadows slash across
the floor as the excited girl listens to the relentless
CHANTING of the children.
Robin pushes on a makeshift wooden door. It slips off
its temporary hinges, crashing down to the floor. The
NOISE is like a rifle shot; suddenly, there is ABSOLUTE
SILENCE in the structure.
Petrified, Robin crouches behind a wall, waiting. The
CHANTING quickly RESUMES and she breathes a long sigh
of relief.
Robin moves through a dark corridor, hugging the walls.
Flushed with excitement, she imagines herself a ""killer""
searching for Wendy. As she moves past an empty room,
she hears a SOFT GIGGLE. Robin stops and listens care-
fully. Once again she hears the GIGGLE, LOUDER this
time, coming from nearby.
Stepping to a doorway, she leans around the corner and
peers inside. In the darkness she can see nothing.
Gathering her courage, she quietly slips into the room.
The room appears empty but a closet door is slightly
ajar. As Robin approaches, she hears a FAINT GASP from
behind her. Whirling around, she sees Wendy crouched
behind a cardboard box in the corner."|speech
32|"WENDY
(HISSING)"|"You better not tell!
Before Robin can react, she hears a THUD from above.
Looking up, she sees Nick's head appear through an
opening in the ceiling. Seeing Robin, then Wendy
standing in the corner, he howls in triumph."|speech
33|(CONTINUED)|5.|speech
34|"CONTINUED:
NICK
(CALLING OUT)"|"Here, killers, here!
Nick's head disappears from the opening and Robin hears
the POUNDING of RUNNING FEET."|speech
35|"WENDY
(MALICIOUSLY)"|"Now you've done it, you idiot!
The CHANTING GROWS LOUDER as the ""killers"" rush towards
the room. Trapped, Wendy looks frantically for an es-
cape but finds nothing. Turning around suddenly, she
grins at Robin, a cruel, hard expression on her face."|speech
36|"WENDY
(CONTINUING; SLOWLY)"|"Kill, kill, kill...
Picking up the chant, Wendy begins to advance on Robin.
Terrified, Robin turns and rushes out of the room,
bowling over Nick in the doorway. Delighted that the
game is continuing with a new victim, he follows Wendy
in pursuit of Robin.
Robin flees down the long, dark corridor, ""KILL, KILL
ECHOING in her wake. As she rounds a corner, Jude ap-
pears, looming up in front of her. Robin screams and
sprints in the opposite direction. Kelly leaps out of
a doorway and grabs for her, but Robin, swinging out
blindly, escapes the ""killer."""|speech
37||INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY 3|location
38|"WENDY
(CONTINUING; SLOWLY)"|"Darting into the large room, Robin collapses against a
wall, gasping for breath. As her eyes adjusts to the
darkness, she spies a rickety ladder extending through
a hole in the floor to the basement below. Stacked up-
right near the opening are several sheets of window
glass. Before Robin can make a move towards the lad-
der, she hears a horrible SCREECH and Wendy appears in
the doorway, a vicious look on her face."|speech
39|WENDY|"Killers, here!
Wendy advances. Terrified, Robin begins to back away."|speech
40|ROBIN|N-n-n-no!|speech
41|(CONTINUED)|6.|speech
42|CONTINUED:|"Nick, Jude and Kelly appear in the doorway, chanting
""Kill, kill."" Moving quickly, Robin grabs the ladder
and starts down into the basement, careful not to knock
over the sheets of glass stacked near the opening.
Peering into the pitch-black basement, Robin hesitates.
But as Wendy and her fellow ""killers"" close in on her,
Robin continues down the ladder. Wendy rushes up and
grabs the ladder."|speech
43|"ROBIN
(CONTINUING)"|"P-p-please!
Wendy grins and shakes the ladder. The chanting is
deafening. Robin hugs the wooden slats. Wendy shakes
even harder. Robin screams. Nick moves around Wendy
to get a better look. He accidentally bumps the glass
stacked next to the opening. The sudden movement is
just enough to dislodge a razor-sharp pane of glass and
send it hurtling down directly at Robin.
The girl's last scream catches in her throat as the
glass slices through her neck. She is instantly
decapitated.
Horrified, Wendy watches the glass and the body crash
to the concrete basement floor. Kelly screams. Jude
sobs loudly. Nick can only stare in shock. Finally,
he manages to speak."|speech
44|"NICK
(WHISPERING HOARSELY)"|"We gotta get somebody quick!
Nick starts to go. Wendy instantly whirls, grabs his
arm."|speech
45|WENDY|"Are you crazy? They'll put us in
jail!
Confused, Nick cannot reply. The other girls grow
silent."|speech
46|"WENDY
(CONTINUING)"|"If we tell anyone, they'll say
it's our fault. Who'd believe it
was an accident?
Nick starts to protest."|speech

CONTINUED: (3)"|"With a final glance down at Robin's mutiliated body,
Wendy quickly ushers her shocked friends out of the
room.
As their FOOTSTEPS ECHO away across the hardwood floor,
there is a terrible silence. Then, starting very
quietly, more FOOTSTEPS are HEARD, this time a single
person approaching the ladder from above. The FOOT-
STEPS STOP and a deep, black shadow falls across the
ladder; HEAVY BREATHING punctuates the oppressive
quiet, growing louder and more anguished."|speech

63|CUT TO:|"We slowly TILT UP TO the tortured features of RAYMOND
HAMMOND, Robin's father. A handsome, dark-haired man
in his late thirties, he teaches history at George
Winston High School.
Wracked with grief, he stands near the opening in the
floor and watches as two Paramedics bring up the body
of his daughter from the dark basement.
A young Policeman standing nearby raises the white
sheet covering Robin's remains. Hammond steps up
and gazes at his daughter's decapitated body. A
look of absolute horror and revulsion freezes
on his face; what he sees he will never forget.
Paralyzed, Hammond barely hears the CAR PULLING UP
in front of the construction site. He turns and
looks out the window."|speech

65|CUT TO:|"A Police Officer is getting out of his car. Walking
around to the passenger side, he opens the door
for an attractive blonde woman in her mid-thirties.
VIVIAN HANMOND, Robin's mother, appears pale and
haggard as she steps out of the car. Kim and Alex
slowly climb out of the back, With the Police Officer
escorting her, Vivian and her children move toward
the skeleton of a building.
Catching sight of her husband framed in a lower window,
Vivian suddenly breaks. away from the Police Officer and
runs inside the building."|speech

hysterical wife as she bursts into the room."|speech
68|HA:MMIOND|No!|speech
69|"VIVIAN
(SOBBING WILDLY)"|"Where is she? Where is Robin?
Seeing the covered figure lying on a stretcher, Vivian
moans in anguish.
Struggling furiously, she strains to break her hus-
band's hold, but he is too powerful.. They are both
in tears, shaking with grief, when Kim and Alex step
into the doorway."|speech
70|"KIM
WHISPERING)"|Daddy?|speech
71|HAMMOND|(angrily,|speech
72|TO VIVIAN)|"Why did you bring them here?
Vivian collapses, burying her head in his shoulder
and sobbing furiously, but Hammond pushes her out of
the room.
HA ` 0 N D"|speech
73|(CONTINUING)|"Kim! Alex! Stay out in the
hallway!
Kim stumbles out into the corridor and begins to
cry softly. Alex takes his mother's hand and tries
comfort her.
The Paramedics pick up the stretcher and maneuver it
out of the room. As they pass through the doorway into
the corridor, a corner of the sheet slips off Robin's
corpse. Before a Paramedic can replace it, the de-
capitated torso is briefly glimpsed by the family.
Alex is shocked. Kim doesn't appear to realize what
she sees. But Vivian's horror wells up in her
throat, bursting out in a deranged scream."|speech

75|CUT TO:|"Another SCREAM, as throbbing DISCO MUSIC pulsates from
a large portable RADIO sitting on a dresser.

figure is slipping into a pair of tight jeans. Pull-
ing on a halter top, she sways to the MUSIC.
VIVIAN (O.S.)"|speech
76|(CALLS OUT)|"Kim! Turn that music down. You're
driving me crazy!
Turning around at the SOUND of her mother's VOICE, Kim
Hammond reaches for the volume control Now eighteen,
she is a strikingly beautiful girl with an open,
innocent quality."|speech
77|"KIM
(CALLS OUT)"|"Okay, Mom!
Kim quickly finishes dressing, whirling around the room
to the pounding disco rhythm. Giving her hair a few
final strokes with a brush, she gazes at a photograph
of a young man stuck in her mirror. On the picture
is written: ""To Kim, the best on the floor... dancing,
that is! Love, Nick.""
Kim glances at another photograph stuck in her mirror.
This one shows her sister, Robin, taken a few days be-
fore the accident. Her sadness passes as quickly as it
came. Gathering her textbooks, she switches OFF the
RADIO and exits.
8 INT. KITCHEN - DAY
Raymond and Vivian Hammond are just finishing break-
fast. The years have favored him; except for a touch
of gray around the temples and a few extra pounds, he
looks much the same way as we remember him. Vivian,
however, wears the strain of the past seven years
in her gaunt, drawn features and high-strung manner.
Thumbing through his morning newspaper, Hammond steals
quick glances at his wife. She does not look up at
him, but stares at the table, toying with her spoon."|speech

HAMMOND"|"(reading the paper)
I'll tell you, Vi, I'm thinking

to have heard him."|speech

9 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
Hammond and Vivian are standing by the fireplace. His
hand is on her shoulder. She faces the mantel, her
back to him. On the mantel is a small shrine to the
memory oftheir dead daughter; a framed photograph,
fresh roses, two candles and a lock of her hair in a
glass case."|speech

14 INT. LOBBY - DAY 14
Hammond and Vivian cross the room. Though she offers
no resistance, it appears he is pulling her along.
They hurry into an elevator after an elderly CLEANING
WOMAN carrying a mop and a bucket.
15 INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 15
They stand in silence. The Cleaning Woman puffs on a
cigarette, blithely ignoring the NO SMOKING sign posted
on the wall. Vivian nervously reaches into her purse
and removes a bottle of Valium. Quickly popping two
pills into her mouth, she swallows with difficulty and
snaps her purse shut. Hammond says nothing.
Just as the elevator doors slide open, the Cleaning Wo-
man touches Vivian on the shoulder, causing her to jump
in fright."|speech

nerves are shot this morning.
With a terrified glance back at the woman, Vivian

Alex is seated opposite his father in the front seat.
Kim is in back. Easy listening MUSIC PLAYS softly on

Hammond slams on the brakes, throwing Alex against
the dashboard.

52 INT. CLASSROOM (LAB) - DAY 52
First period biology class features MONTY WELLER, a
tall, thin Englishman in his late thirties. This stuf-
fy, dour science teacher drones on about the joys of ex-
ploring frog vertebrae while most of his class naps,
daydreams or passes notes.
Seated in the back near the door, Jude is furtively
opening a handwritten note. She quickly reads it.
Stifling a giggle, she looks up to see Kim and Vicki
across the aisle, eagerly awaiting her reply. Jude
tears out part of a page from her biology book and
scrawls her answer. Folding the note, she taps the boy
next to her and motions for him to pass it on.
Vicki grabs the note from the boy. Quickly scanning
it, she nods, impressed. Kim reads it and mouths the
word ""Wow"" to Jude who blushes happily.
Glancing out into the hallway, Jude notices Slick walk-
ing past. Seeing her in class, he stops and waves.
Jude frantically tries to motion him away. Their backs
to the door, Kim and Vicki watch with curiosity as Jude
gestures in their direction. Seeing her friends
watching her, Jude smiles and tries to ignore Slick.
Not to be denied, he exaggeratedly mimes Weller, nose
to his textbook, lecturing on, oblivious to his class.
Jude laughs in spite of herself. Kim and Vicki turn
around.
Glancing out the door, the two girls stare in disbelief
at the small weird curly-haired boy doing a perfect im-
itation of the eminently boring Weller. Their surprise
turns to hilarity as they realize this boy must be
Jude's prom date. Kim holds up the note, raising her
eyebrows as she gestures toward Slick. Jude nods. Kim
and Vicki can barely contain their laughter. They do
not notice Mr. Weller eyeing them suspiciously as he
rattles on about frog intestines. Slick mouths the
words, ""See you at lunch.., in the van."" Jude nods and
smiles.
With a final bow and a wave, he exits.
Kim suddenly looks up to find a red-faced Mr. Weller
looming above her."|speech

A hand is flipping through the pages of the Winston

photographs of graduating students are placed. The
hand stops, moves across an open page to a smiling head
shot of Nick McBride.
The hand rips the picture from the page, sets it down
on a plain wooden desk alongside three other pictures

Jude Cunningham, Kelly Lynch, and Wendy Richards.
The yearbook is slammed shut.

Two of the gang pin Alex against the counter. Wiping

Alex in the stomach. The boy groans and doubles over.
Lou grabs Alex's hair and slams his head back against

terrible sadness. Hammond carefully guides her away.
Kim has a flower of her own, a white rose, which she
drops on her sister's grave. She turns, meets Alex's
stare, moves off after her parents. Alex remains a mo-

66 EXT. TENNIS COURTS DAY
During the afternoon phys. ed. class, the girls play
tennis: Kim with Kelly and Vicki with Jude. Sykes
lingers nearby, watching the girls. Their instructor
is Miss HENRI-ANNE BENTON, a stocky woman in her late
thirties with teased, lacquered hair. A product of
genteel Southern womanhood, Henri-Anne stalks the
courts in her baggy Bermuda shorts, constantly blowing
a silver whistle hanging from her neck.
A very stoned, giggling Jude runs Vicki ragged, hitting
balls over the fence, straight up in the air and occa-
sionally even back over her head. Each time a ball
flies over the fence, Vicki runs to retrieve it to the
delight of Sykes.
At one point, Vicki bends over to pick up a ball under
Sykes' appreciative gaze. The shrill WHISTLE inter-

She storms out. Melanie looks at Kim and Kelly,

room.
Kim and Kelly look at each other, laugh, turn their
faces back to the steaming water. Neither one hears
the SOUND across the room, a HARSH RHYTHMIC HEAVY
BREATHING.
Kelly bends her head away from the water, clears her
eyes., She squints out through the steam at the big
wall mirror across the room. She sees something. She
steps back into Kim, her eyes wide with fear."|speech
505|KIM|"Watch it...
Kelly covers her breasts with her arms, presses against
the wall, terrified.
Suddenly there's an EXPLOSION of SOUND. Kim screams,
jumps back, stares. There's a jagged hole in the cen-
ter of the mirror, huge cracks radiating from it,
spidering across its surface.
For a moment no one moves. Splinters of GLASS TRICKLE
down to the floor. There's no other sound. Kim grabs
for her towel, steps out of the shower, looks. There's
no one. She heads for the locker room door. Kelly
runs after her."|speech

668|ALEX|You look almost like a woman!|speech

671|ALEX|You're my sister... I'll leer!|speech
672|"KIM
(LAUGHS)"|"Pin this on me, you creep,

Alex takes the corsage. As he attaches the bright red
flower on her gown, she playfully dabs perfume on his
neck. He pulls back, pricking himself on the pin."|speech

677|ALE|"er's face is revealed. It is the nine-year-old Alex.
Kim cradles the killer on the ground. She turns his
head toward the light. We SEE his face full-on."|speech
678|VIVIA N|"Robin!
She rushes forward, lunging for the body. Hammond
grabs her, restraining her.
Alex's dark eyes stare back unseeing at his family.
His resemblance to his dead twin sister is uncanny.
His hair falls onto his forehead in bangs, as Robin's
had done seven years before. His makeup has been slop-
pily applied. The rouged cheeks and the smudged red
lips amplify the grotesque impersonation.
Kim strokes her brother's hair. Hammond presses his
hysterical wife to him. The onlookers slowly close in.
We SLOWLY DISSOLVE FROM Alex's face TO a photograph of
the Hammond family taken seven years earlier. We MOVE
IN CLOSE ON the twins. Alex and Robin are smiling.
FADE OUT."|speech
