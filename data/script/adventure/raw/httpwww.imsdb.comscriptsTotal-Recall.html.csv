1||FADE IN:|stage direction
2||1       EXT. DESERT - DAY|unknown
3||"All we can see, filling the entire frame is a flame-orange
sky...almost like the sky from the burning of Atlanta in
""Gone with the Wind"".
SUPERIMPOSE:  Presenter credit.
PAN DOWN lower and lower until we see the terrain below...
the desert.  There is no vegetation whatever, just sand and
odd-shaped rock formations.  The air is filled with red dust,
which alternately obscures and then reveals the image.
CAMERA MOVES FORWARD optically - enlarging the film grain in
the process.
SLOW DISOLVE
OPENING CREDITS BEGIN.
ANOTHER SHOT of a barren landscape, once more with bizarre
rocks.  Dust.  Sound of wind.  CAMERA MOVES FORWARD again.
DISSOLVE.
ANOTHER LANDSCAPE, but this time, in the distance are some
enormous plastic domes.  Sunlight striking them and reflect-
ing causes brilliant rainbows.  CAMERA optically tracks
toward the dome, seen in tantalizingly indistinct fashion
through the red dust.  DISSOLVE...
ANOTHER ANGLE, and, in the distance, on the horizon of the
arid landscape is a huge SPHINX-LIKE STRUCTURE.  (It is
reminiscent of the Egyptian sphinx, but both body and face,
though gargoyle-like, are different in design.)  There are
some large pyramids not far from the sphinx.  CAMERA MOVES
optically FORWARD.  DISSOLVE.
CAMERA is much closer to the sphinx and is directly in front.
It moves (combination of zoom and optical printer move)
towards the eyes, which appear to be red gems.
As CAMERA APPROACHES one of the eyes, it appears to be
stained red glass, as in a temple.  Suddenly there is a
terrific explosion and the glass shatters into millions of
fragments which hurtle toward the camera..."|stage direction
4||"2       INT. CATACOMB BELOW ""SPHINX"" - DAY"|unknown
5||"A MAN wearing a LIGHTWEIGHT THERMAL SUIT is RUNNING THROUGH
THIS LABYRINTH of TUNNELS.  The GROUND TREMBLES under him,
as if in an earthquake.  We cannot clearly make out his face,
especially since he wears some kind of BREATHING APPARATUS
over a portion of it.
The surface of the tunnel's ""walls"" is curious;  the walls
are, again, bright reddish orange, and a composite of two
different substances:  rough-textured, clay-like material
and red quartz, which glistens like crystal.
The man throws a backward glance over his shoulder, fear-
fully, as he runs.  His HANDS are SPLATTERED with BLOOD.
Because of this, the RED GLOW, the air of FEAR to the man,
and the GROUND HEAVING and BUCKLING, there is almost a
SATANIC suggestion to the scene.
Suddenly, up AHEAD of the man, there appears a BRILLIANT
WHITE LIGHT.  He SEES IT, and runs even faster towards it.
We are ALMOST UP TO THE LIGHT, and we SEE HANDS REACHING
OUT OF THE LIGHT TOWARDS US... that seem to beckon him to
SAFETY.
ABRUPTLY, the ENTIRE SCREEN GOES RED, BUT IN REVERSE NEGATIVE;
with YELLOW LAYOVERS.  (So that all the images we see --
ENTIRE FRAME -- are small YELLOW AREAS diffused on a RED
BACKGROUND.)  It is much like looking at a tableau made out
of molten lava.

17|CLOCK|Tick, tock --|speech
18||"Quail reaches out and shuts the clock off.  Then he sits up
in bed.
He swings his legs out from under the covers and sits on the
edge of the bed.  He puts on his glasses and sits, lost  in
thought.
He is a good-looking but conventional man in his early
thirties.  He seems rather in awe of his wife, who is
attractive and rather off-hand towards him.
Kirsten pulls on her robe, lights a cigarette, sits fishing
for her slippers."|stage direction

34||"Quail and Kirsten sit at a small table, eating breakfast.
On the WALL is projected the front page of a NEWSPAPER.
Drinking his coffee, Quail studies the wall with the air
of a man who had his ""node stuck in a newspaper,"" ignoring
his wife.
The newspaper headline reads:  ""RIOTING ON MARS OVER WATER
TAX.""
His wife is reading a different article:  ""Four Women Rape
Man in Park."""|stage direction

reading ""A FREE MARS"", ""DOWN WITH COHAAGEN"", ""EARTH - OUT""

powerless."|speech
52|KIRSTEN|"Well, there's a lot of things
we need around here before
we waste our money on a trip
to Mars.  We're broke.  I'm
just a slave around this dump.
Now if you were capable of
finding a better job...."|speech

and leaves."|stage direction
57||4A      EXT. CITY - EARLY MORNING|unknown
58||"CAMERA TRACKS with Quail as he walks along the busy modern
street towards a subway station.  Modern cars (out of focus)
pass noiselessly between the camera and Quail.  There is a
plaintive tune being played on violin.  Quail pauses and
gives a wad of notes to the aged violinist, then walks on
briskly."|stage direction
59||5       INT. SUBWAY STATION - EARLY MORNING|unknown
60||"Quail enters the station.  Everybody must pass through a
weapons check before proceeding to the platforms.
TWO ARMED GUARDS stand at either side, as commuters pass
through an electronic beam.  On a screen, the entire body
of each person is seen in X-ray.  All of them are clearly
carrying a gun in their inside coat pocket."|stage direction
61|GUARD|No weapon again, Mr. Quail?|speech
62|QUAIL|"I keep forgetting, Herb.  They
frighten me."|speech
63|GUARD|"Yeah?  Well, it's the law,
Mr. Quail.  Has been since
1990 they tell me.  Tomorrow -
ya carry ya gun or ya get
reported."|speech

through this with Quail before."|stage direction
65|QUAIL|Okay.  Herb, okay.|speech
66||"Quail walks on to the track area.  The train arrives.
Signs above each approaching car say ""CAR FULL"", ""ROOM

on which a NEWS BROADCAST is showing."|stage direction
69|NEWSCASTER (V.O.)|"-- more violence today from Mars's
strike-torn ore colonies --"|speech
70||"Everyone ignores the broadcast -- except Quail, who perks
instantly at the word ""Mars.""
The NEWSCASTER is a young black man."|stage direction
71||(continuing)|location
72|NEWSCASTER|"...but Earth Intelligence Operations
Director Vilos Cohaagen, clearly
worried about the damage to Mars's
all important tourist
industry was today dismissive
of the dissident groups...."|speech
73||"TV scene switches to a press conference.  COHAAGEN, sur-
rounded by AIDES, steps in front of a podium packed with
news network microphones and cameras.  Cohaagen is a
striking, intense man with an obvious air of power."|stage direction
74||"We're dealing with a bunch of
extremists and unrepresentative
lunatics.  Mars is a happy and
prosperous protectorate of Earth...
and will remain so."|unknown
75||"The train stops at another station and more people pile on.
Quail tries to watch the broadcast through the bodies
passing in front of him and intermittently blocking the
image."|stage direction
76|REPORTER (V.O.)|"There have been some criticisms,
sir...."|speech
77|COHAAGEN|I have no further comment.|speech
78||"The news conference ends and a bright looking young man
comes on the screen.  Quail continues to watch, though
not as interested, initially, as he was by the Mars story.
Few of the other passengers bother looking at the screen."|stage direction
79|ANNOUNCER|"Good morning, commuters.  This
portion of your trip is brought
to you by Rekall, Inc.  Do you
have a dream that never came
true?  Do you aspire - but
only perspire?  Has the great
adventure passed you by?  Then
come to... REKALL, where what
might have been will have been.
For the memories of a
lifetime... REKALL."|speech
80||"Quail watches the commercial through to the end, but doesn't
seem to take it very seriously.  He glances away as a card
comes on the screen with REKALL's numbers."|stage direction
81||6B      INT. QUAIL'S OFFICE - DAY|unknown
82||"Quail is seated at a computer console in a vast beehive
of a room.  Numerous people are typing information onto
the screens.  Quail pauses in his typing, thoughtful.  He
then types in a little more information, then pauses again.
On the screen, a sentence types itself...
WHY HAVE YOU STOPPED?  REQUEST MORE INFORMATION.
Quail read it and continues."|stage direction

iastic man."|stage direction
85|McCLANE|"We're all dreamers, Douglas.
But here at Rekall, dreams
are our business."|speech
86||"He presses a button on his desk and the chairs on which
they are seated appear to be in outer space.  Countless
stars glitter all around.  Startlingly, a comet whizzes by.
Quail is amazed.  McClane grins and presses the button
again.  The scene changes to a beautiful underwater coral
reef.  Multi-colored fish swim around the chairs and desk."|stage direction
87|QUAIL|"But... is the process really
that effective?  A false
memory!?"|speech
88||(shaking his head;|location
89||smiling)|unknown
90|McCLANE|"We prefer the term ""extra-
factual implant"".  Your
memory will be complete in
every way.  You will have
gone to Mars.  We guarantee
that."|speech
91|QUAIL|"Is it in any way dangerous?
I mean, the medical techniques?"|speech
92|McCLANE|"Not when you deal with
qualified operators - like
us."|speech
93||"He presses the button again and the normal office returns.
Quail looks around, impressed."|stage direction
94|QUAIL|It's just - incredible.|speech
95|McCLANE|"And look at our follow-up
program!"|speech
96||He puts items on the desk as he talks.|stage direction
97||(continuing)|location
98|McCLANE|"Space-flight ticket stub...
passport... vaccination
certificates... matchbooks
from Martian Nouvelle Cuisine
Restaurants, souvenirs, post
cards... even names of people
you met - now back there -
who you can call and discuss
your trip with... by the way,
we plant these things where
you'll come across them at
random in the future."|speech
99|QUAIL|"But... I'll know I hired you.
That'll destroy the whole
illusion."|speech
100||(smiling; self-|location
101||satisfied)|unknown
102|McCLANE|"But you won't remember me, or
having been here."|speech
103|QUAIL|I won't?|speech

We've never paid out yet."|speech

month, for only two-hundred
thousand dollars more."|speech

A15  SPORTS HERO
A16  INDUSTRIAL TYCOON
A17  INTELLIGENCE AGENT"|stage direction

110|McCLANE|"You can have a new identity
for the duration of the trip.
Pick one."|speech
111||"Quail's eyes linger on ""Intelligence Agent."""|stage direction
112|QUAIL|"""Intelligence Agent""... wouldn't
that be dangerous?  I might
attack...."|speech
113||(airily)|location
114|McCLANE|"No.  No.  You're a retired
agent.  Mars was your last
mission and you're never to
break your cover.  But you'll
have got the girl, killed the
baddies, and saved the
Universe.  Not bad, eh?"|speech
115|QUAIL|"I don't know... about the
whole thing... it's all such
a fake.  I won't really have
gone.  I won't really...."|speech
116||(kind but firm)|location
117|McCLANE|"Let's face it, Douglas, you,
and millions of people like
you have no chance of ever
getting to Mars and you'd
never qualify as a secret
agent for EIO.  This - REKALL
- is the only way to achieve
your dream."|speech
118||He gets up and walks around to Quail's chair.|stage direction
119||(continuing)|location
120|McCLANE|"Think about it, Douglas.
Think, too, what a terrible
boor a real holiday is.
Lost tickets, endless arguments,
lousy hotels, missed connections,
rotten weather... Rekall will
supply you with perfect, happy
memories."|speech

122||9A      INT. QUAIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT|unknown
123||"Quail is sitting, distracted, in an uncomfortable modern
chair.  Kirsten is watching a near-pornographic film on
TV.  She casually lights a cigarette."|stage direction

125||KIRSTEN|unknown
126|QUAIL|"Yeah?  Who's going to report
me?  You?... wimp...."|speech
127||She watches a torrid love scene on the video.|stage direction
128||(continuing)|location
129|KIRSTEN|"Screwing around's illegal,
too.  But just give me half
a chance..."|speech
130||"Quail looks at her with distaste.  His expression changes
to one of resolve."|stage direction
131||10      INT. MEMORY STUDIO - DAY|unknown
132||"Quail is stretched out on a plush reclining couch, alongside
some strange-looking lab equipment, wearing a hospital-type
smock.  In the b.g. hovers a TECHNICIAN, adjusting some
instrumentation (discreet banks of computers, etc.) -- that
apparently relates to the lab equipment next to Quail.  The
room in a dim, soothing booth, lit by indirect lighting.
Quail looks a little concerned as he studies all the
instrumentation next to him -- as one always does at the
dentist's, looking at the drills.
The door opens abruptly, in walks a cute-looking LITTLE
OLD LADY, wearing a JOGGING SUIT.  (A RUTH GORDON-TYPE.)"|stage direction

144|ERNIE (TECHNICIAN)|Okay -- that's it.|speech
145||"Now, Lull extends a long rubber tube, a hypodermic needle
attached to it.  Quail eyes it warily.  She swabs the back
of his hand in preparation, notices his apprehension."|stage direction
146|LULL|"Now, just relax, kid.  This
ain't gonna hurt.  Just a
controlled drip of Narkadine.
When you're under, I'll just
ask ya a few questions, nothin'
real personal, just full
details of yer private life
so's we can tailor the
wish-fulfillment program to
your needs."|speech
147||"She injects the needle into his hand as she speaks, tapes
it down."|stage direction
148||(continuing)|location
149|LULL|"See?  Painless.  I didn't feel
a thing.  Hey, you're a nice
kid... you like a little
somethin' extra?"|speech

briefly at a typed sheet in front of her."|stage direction

Quail's eyes open and scan the room.  They settle on
McClane.  These eyes have changed:  they have become

his file and cancel his fee.
I have a feeling that the
