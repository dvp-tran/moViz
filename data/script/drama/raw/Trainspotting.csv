Just ahead of him is Spud. They are both belting along.
As they travel, various objects (pens, tapes, CDs, toiletries, ties,
sunglasses, etc.) either fall or are discarded from inside their jackets.
They are pursued by two hard-looking Store Detectives in identical uniforms.
The men are fast, but Renton and Spud maintain their lead."|stage direction

In a moment of detachment he stops and looks at the shocked driver, then at

another team at football.
The opposition all wear an identical strip (Arsenal), whereas Renton and his
friends wear an odd assortment of gear.
Three girls -- Lizzy, Gail, and Allison and Baby -- stand by the side,
watching.
The boys are outclassed by the team with the strip but play much dirtier.
As each performs a characteristic bit of play, the play freezes and their
name is visible, printed or written on some item of clothing. (T-Shirt,
baseball cap, shorts, trainers). In Begbie's case, his name appears as a
tatoo on his arm.
Sick Boy commits a sneaky foul and indignantly denies it.
Begbie commits an obvious foul and make no effort to deny it.
Spud, in goal, lets the ball in between his legs.
Tommy kicks the ball as hard as he can.
Renton's litany continues over the action:"|stage direction

stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. Choose rotting away at
the end of it all, pishing you last in a miserable home, nothing
more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked-up brats you
have spawned to replace yourself. Choose your future. Choose life."|speech

we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid.
Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and
you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only
one worry: scoring. When you're off it you are suddenly obliged to
worry about all sorts of other shite. Got no money: can't get
pished. Got money: drinking too much. Can't get a bird: no chance
of a ride. Got a bird: too much hassle. You have to worry about
bills, about food, about some football team that never fucking

don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit."|speech

are playing pool. No problems, and I'm playing like Paul fucking
Newman by the way. I'm giving the boy here the tanning of a
lifetime. So anyway, it comes to the final ball, the deciding shot
of the tournament: I'm on the black and he's sitting in the
corner, looking all biscuit-arsed. Then this hard cunt comes in.
Obviously fancied himself. Starts looking at me. Right fucking at
me. Trying to put off, like, just for kicks. Looking at me as if
to say, 'Come ahead, square go.' Well, you know me, I'm no looking
for trouble but at the end of the day I'm the cunt with the pool
cue and I'm game for a swedge. So I squared up, casual like. So
what does the hard cunt do, or so-called hard cunt? Shites it.
Puts down his drink, turns around and gets the fuck out of there.
And after that, the game was mine."|speech

Lining up for the final ball, Begbie is distracted by a large Hard Man
standing at the bar staring at him.
Begbie stands up and walks slowly towards the Hard Man.
They stand, eye to eye, for a moment.
Begbie swings the pool cue slowly into his palm.
The Hard Man turns and leaves.
Begbie drinks the Hard Man's pint, then pots the black with a brilliant

so bad he can hardly hold the fucking cue, never mind pot the
ball. I'm doing my best to lose, trying to humour him, like, but
it's not doing any good: every time I touch the ball I pot
something, every time Begbie goes near the table he fucks it up.
So he's got the hump, right, but finally I manage to set it up so
all he's go to do is pot the black to win one game and salvage a
little pride and maybe not kick my head in, right. So he's on the
black, pressure shot, and it all goes wrong, big time. What does
he do? Picks on this specky wee gadge at the bar and accuses him
of putting him off by looking at him. Can you believe it? I mean,
the poor cunt hasn't even glanced in our direction. He's sitting
there quiet as a mouse when Beggars gubs him with the cue. He was
going to chib him, I tell you, then I thought he was going to do
me. The Beggar is fucking psycho, but he's a mate, you know, so
what can you do?"|speech

Begbie and Tommy are playing pool.
Begbie, furious, miscues, goes in off, etc.

Begbie lines up to play the black. It is unmissable.
At the bar beyond sits a harmless young Man, wearing the same clothes as the
Hard Man in Begbie's account except that they are now baggy rather than
taut. He is clearly not staring at Begbie but drinks a half-pint and eats
some crisps.
As Begbie plays, the Man bites a crisp.
Begbie miscues, rips the cloth and the ball flies off the table.
Tommy catches it and looks up to see Begbie assaulting the young Man.
Tommy cautiously restrains Begbie and he reaches into his jacket for a

I understand that you have entered into a programme of
