5||"Beneath a jawdroppingly storybook castle, a small
Renaissance Fair with florid awnings, demented ACROBATS
and roaring puppets is unfolding.
RUSTIC FARMERS and their families rumble with enjoyment
at the Sabbath afternoon entertainment.
Encircled by children, A JUGGLER WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY
ETCHED FACE elegantly plucks the red balls from a pouch
on his mule.  As he begins to juggle, a LOUD EXPLOSION
is heard, causing him to ungracefully drop his balls
and collapse in a heap.
Everyone at the fair, including the puppets, looks up."|stage direction

9||"where the charismatic LEONARDO DA VINCI laughs down at
him.  Da Vinci wears a pair of very early, very cool sun-
glasses with his trademark beard.
He turns and loses his smile, something extraordinary
reflecting off his glasses.  Removing his shades, Da
Vinci moves to the Something, a gloriously incredible
machine.  The opening CREDITS REVEAL its dazzling idio-
syncrasies.
TWO COUGHING APPRENTICES haplessly try to disperse smoke
from the still billowing, mysteriously spectacular
Machine.  Mirrors attached to parts of it reflect beams
of light which cut through the smoke like a Renaissance
laser show."|stage direction

turns.  Steam escapes upwards.  The machine immediately
slows down.  Da Vinci oh-so-gently coughs and moves for-
ward with tongs.
A LITTLE TROUGH - IN THE MACHINE'S INNARDS
comes to a trembling, mystical halt.  Right behind this
trough is a CONPLEX POLYHEDRON CRYSTAL as intricately
modulated as any Rubik stocking stuffer, but much more
dazzling in beauty.  It gleams like a jewel in the yellow
glow which pours from a PLEASANTLY GRINNING DEMONHEAD into
a trough--a glow of heat--and something more than heat.
The tongs enter the frame.
Da Vinci brings the object closer to his face.  A murmur
goes up from the awestruck apprentices as the Master
peers at the smoking yellow bar."|stage direction

20||INT. DA VINCI'S WORKSHOP|location
21||"With an accompanying blast of smoke, Da Vinci bursts
through some double doors into his workshop, sadly
reflecting upon the crystal in one hand and the tonged
bar in the other.
His workshop is a spendiferously enigmatic blend of
laboratory and studio; On a table in the foreground is
a fresh clay equestrian statue; a large VOLUME of
sketches, the inkwell nearby; a MODEL of what looks like
a HELICOPTER; Da Vinci flings the tonged bar on the table
among these goodies.
Pocketing the crystal, Da Vinci meanders through his work-
shop casually tinkering with various experiments.  He
snaps his fingers at a BATHING SUITED APPRENTICE, wearing
a diving helmet prototype.  The Apprentice jumps into a
pool of water.
Leonardo next stops at an easel displaying a finished-
except-for-the-mouth portrait of Mona Lisa, who happens
to be seated in a stool before the easel.  She broadly
smiles, revealing the worst dental work of her epoch.
Da Vinci shakes his head and moves out onto a"|stage direction
22||EXT. CASTLE TERRACE|location
23||"A FLYING APPRENTICE sails past Leonardo in a bat winged
glider, enthusiastically shouting.  Da Vinci grins back
until he touches his pocket.  He pulls out the crystal
and, after a beat, angrily twists it apart into two
separate, geometric pieces revealing a small intricate
mirror.  He quickly folds the surprisingly shapable
geometric pieces.
Calming down, Da Vinci looks from the three components of
the crystal to each of the three unfinished works on the
table in his workshop.  He ponders then looks back out to
the Vinci vista.
The bat winged glider DISSOLVES into:
A HAWK

That's your mark, man.  What did
Little Eddie ever do to..."|speech

A NEWSPAPER TRUCK pulls up in front of the Auction House.
The Driver pops out with a bundle of papers and moves to
a Dispenser on the corner.  The Bums wheel around the
truck.  The Driver loads the papers and bounds back.
The Truck pulls away from the corner.  The shopping cart
rolls off--the bums nowhere to be seen.
The Truck turns the corner, revealing the derelicts
climbing up the back of it, with Glad bags around their
necks.  The Truck moves toward an enclosed Walkway Bridge

Battered by wind and fear, Hawk clutches to the gurney

A PEACEFUL OFF-ROAD
Hawk, with an unchanged expression of pure white knuckle
fear, comes to a tranquil gurney-wheels-gently-squeaking
stop.
Lit by the flames of the ambulance crash, a sneering
young man in wire rim glasses emerges from the darkness,
carrying a steel suitcase.  He kneels before Hawk and
opens the suitcase revealing a complex computer appara-
tus.  He begins mumbling into a cellular phone.
A malevolent, SILENT DEADPAN WRAITH passes him and
approaches Hawk.  Both men are dressed in outfits that
seem to be a melange of fascist uniform and haute
couture.
On the fingers of one Wraith hand is carved the word
HATE.  On the other hand is the word FROG.  The Frog Hand
hands a befuddled Hawk a card.  It reads: MY NAME IS KIT
KAT AND THIS IS NOT A DREAM.
Hawk looks up with a ""huh"" expression as Kit Kat chops

1244||"MACHINE
Minerva turns toward the machine in anger and confusion.
The center of the machine blows.  The pool of molten gold
rockets at the viewer.
Mirrors explode and the lasers slash at the walls.
Minerva tumbles from the machine, screaming, that is to
say, trying to scream, because molten gold covers her
face.  It bubbles and cascades, turning her into a
bizarrely beautiful echo of Nefertiti.
HAWK AND ANNA
turn to retreat, and see, standing in the mouth of the
open double doors, in an open shirt, wearing Indian war
paint on his face and the words RULE BRITANNIA painted
on his chest, ALFRED!"|stage direction

Anna pulls a gun from a technician's holster and prays
for forgiveness.  She aims steadily, and fires...
right into Hawk's arm.  This allows Alfred to knock him
back with a strong punch."|stage direction

Hawk back against a wall.  Alfred lunges out with his
blade, hitting the wall off-angle.  Hawk yanks the shaft.
Alfred goes with the flow and presses the shaft on Hawk's
throat.
Gasping, Hawk looks to a rip in Alfred's shirt and sees
a hinge and lever on the shaft.  With an all or nothing
jerk, Hawk flicks the lever.  The shaft clicks on the
hinge.
Alfred's greater strength and narrower grip makes it fold
away from Hawk and suddenly it is"|stage direction

THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP
Hawk and Anna rush into the Da Vinci workshop.  She

up and savagely clamps his teeth into her throat sending
her crashing to the ground.
Hawk pauses in disbelief before raising the gun.
Bunny continues to viciously gnaw away on the convulsing
Anna, blood gently starts to emerge.
Hawk can't get off a shot.  He throws down the gun in
exasperation.  It lands next to The Gadget that is
connected to the Tennis Ball Machine.  Hawk rushes
forward, picks up the gadget, turns the dial to Ten, and
then smiles sweetly toward the dog."|stage direction

A tennis ball comes rocketing out of the machine.
Bunny leaps and catches the rocketing ball but the force
of it sends him FLYING AND CRASHING out a window.
Hawk pulls up Anna as the machine completely EXPLODES.
A huge chunk of the roof THUDS before the workshop door.

A SMALL PIAZZA
The mule trots into a small storybook piazza in the hush
of dawn.  Hawk, Anna, and the unforgettable Juggler ride
atop it.
A WOMAN WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE moves to a cafe
table with a luminous smile.  She unfolds a table cloth
