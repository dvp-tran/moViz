3||INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE. DAY|location
4||"A landing at the top of a crooked, wooden staircase. There is
a threadbare, braided rug on the floor. There is a long, wide
corridor decorated with faded paintings of sailboats and
battleships. The wallpapers are sun-bleached and peeling at
the corners except for a few newly-hung strips which are
clean and bright. A small easel sits stored in the corner.
Outside, a hard rain falls, drumming the roof and rattling
the gutters.
A ten-year-old boy in pajamas comes up the steps carefully
eating a bowl of cereal as he walks. He is Lionel. Lionel
slides open the door to a low cabinet under the window. He
takes out a portable record player, puts a disc on the
turntable, and sets the needle into the spinning groove.
A child's voice says over the speaker:"|stage direction
5|unknown|"RECORD PLAYER (V.O.)
In order to show you how a big symphony
orchestra is put together, Benjamin
Britten has written a big piece of music,
which is made up of smaller pieces that
show you all the separate parts of the
orchestra."|speech
6||"As Lionel listens, three other children wander out of their
bedrooms and down to the landing.
The first is an eight-year-old boy in a bathrobe. He is
Murray. The second is a nine-year-old boy in white boxer
shorts and a white undershirt. He is Rudy. The third is a
twelve-year-old girl in a cardigan sweater with knee-high
socks and brightly polished, patent-leather shoes. She is
Suzy. She carries a one-month-old striped kitten.
The boys drop down to the floor next to their brother. They
lie on their stomachs with their chins propped up on their
fists, listening.
Suzy sits in the windowsill. She opens a book called Shelly
and the Secret Universe. There is an illustration on the
cover of a young gymnast with a glowing amulet around her
neck.
Suzy starts to read -- then pauses. She lowers her book. She
raises a pair of junior binoculars to her eyes. She looks out
into the rain."|stage direction

9||"A rickety, three-story, stone-and-shingle house on a hillside
with turrets and a widow's walk. A weather vane swings
creaking on the roof. Tree tops sway in a cluster below. The
sea is almost invisible in the misting rain, and the mainland
is a shadow across the sound. Suzy sits in the high window,
watching."|stage direction

11||"The family stuck indoors all day out of the rain.
In bedrooms, bathrooms, and corridors, we see the boys. They
shoot marbles. They throw jacks. They play cards. They eat
grilled cheese sandwiches together in the kitchen.
In half-open doorways, we see the parents. Mr. Bishop is a
tall, fifty-year-old man in Madras trousers and horn-rimmed
glasses. He reads the newspaper and drinks coffee. Mrs.
Bishop is a tan, forty-five-year-old woman in a Lilly
Pulitzer-type wrap-around skirt. She washes her hair,
topless, in the kitchen sink.
In windows, we see Suzy with her binoculars. She watches wet
branches shaking in the woods. She watches a man in a slicker
fishing from a row-boat. She watches a white colt in a field.
She eats a bowl of tomato soup alone in the pantry.
In the distance, a seaplane flies by below the clouds."|stage direction

Sixteen miles long. Forested with old-

foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry
that runs twice daily from Stone Cove.
The year is 1965. We are on the far edge

ferocious and well-documented storm which

in a row. A banner on a flag-pole ripples in the wind. It

neckerchief plays a staccato tattoo. He has a gauze patch
over one eye. He is Lazy-Eye.
A thirty-five-year-old man in the same uniform emerges
through the flaps of a larger tent. He is Scout Master Ward.
He puts on a wide-brimmed felt hat. A badge on the crown
reads Khaki Scouts, Troop 55. He lights a cigarette. A thin
scout with curly hair and sunglasses joins him at his side.

An off-road motorcycle races by in the background behind the
tents. It jumps a mound of dirt, kicks sideways in the air,
and revs away riding a wheelie. Scout Master Ward frowns.
Scout Master Ward stops in front of a pile of boards and logs
stacked six feet high. A thick-set scout with black hair and

As Scout Master Ward reads, all the scouts begin to join him

unscrew the tops of tin mess-kits and assemble folding

over, examining the space. He lifts the lid of the foot
locker. He looks under the corner of the mattress. He picks
up a piece of folded yellow notebook paper sticking out from
under a pillow. He opens it and stares at it. He turns
suddenly to the chair against the wall of the tent and slides
it aside.
