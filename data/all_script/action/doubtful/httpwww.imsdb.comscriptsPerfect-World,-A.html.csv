JOHN LEE HANCOCK
December 1992 Draft
FOR EDUCATIONAL
PURPOSES ONLY
1   MUSIC UP. It's a tad eerie. If a Zydeco band died in a     1
bus crash this is the kind of music they'd play in heaven.
FADE IN ON:
WHITE SCREEN
which transforms to a milky white and eventually into a
bright high noon sun. A large black bird flies in circles
overhead. As it wipes the sun a bright flare causes...
CLOSEUP - PAIR OF EYES
to squint, then adjust to the light and finally open.    They
look tired, but content, maybe even relaxed.
CLOSEUP - MAN
the owner of the eyes. Though we only see from his shoulders
to the top of his head, we can tell he's lying in a field.
His arm is propped behind his head as a pillow and he appears
to be resting comfortably. MUFFLED VOICES and WHISPERS fill
the air but they seem to come from another place. The man
doesn't notice them. His name is BUTCH.
A gust of wind blows Butch's hair a bit and a piece of straw
wipes across his forehead. Then, oddly enough, it is followed
by a dollar bill, which rests against his cheek, then skitters
across his face. It is followed by another and another, a
five, a ten, a single. Butch pays no attention. He's in
another world.
DISSOLVE TO:
2   EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - MADISONVILLE, TX. - DUSK                 2
SUPERSCRIPT:    OCTOBER, 1963.
A small country town. Normally quiet at this hour, the
street is tonight alive with trick or treaters dressed as
witches, goblins and superheroes making their annual door to
door rounds.
3   EXT. PERRY HOUSE - NIGHT                                     3
GLADYS PERRY, 30 going on 45 due to single motherhood and
having worked two fulltime minimum wage jobs the past ten
years, looks out the window with disgust and pulls the
curtains closed.
4   INT. PERRY HOUSE - NIGHT                                     4
Gladys retreats   from the sparsly decorated living room to the
predictably drab   linoleum kitchen. At the table, hands on
their laps, sit   her children, NAOMI and RUTH, twin girls aged
10, and PHILLIP,   a quiet boy of 8.

Gladys sets a casserole on the table and goes to the frig for
a container of milk. The children WHISPER to one another...
NAOMI
Judy Baumer is going as a twirler.
RUTH
But she's so fat.     I'd go as Cinderella...
or Peter Pan.
NAOMI
Peter Pan's a boy. Tinker Bell's a girl.
Phillip could go as Peter Pan... 'cept
you gotta' fly.
Phillip smiles a bit at the notion.
RUTH
Phillip could go as a bump on a log.
The girls giggle and Phillip frowns.
PHILLIP
Why can't we go just once?
NAOMI
Caus' we jus' can't, ok?
Gladys sets milk and butter on the table and stares directly
at her son.
GLADYS
Our personal beliefs lift us to a higher
place. 'Sides, Halloween is nothing but
the Devil's work.
The DOORBELL RINGS.   The kids gulp as Gladys turns and heads
for the door.
5   EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT                                       5
MR. HUGHES, a 35-year-old family man is playing chaperone to
prepubescent versions of SUPERMAN, TINKERBELL, and a DANCING
SKELETON.
KIDS
(in unison)
Trick or treat!!!
Gladys simply stares at the children before looking to Mr.
Hughes.
GLADYS
I'm sorry but we don't take no part in
Halloween.

MR. HUGHES
Excuse me?
Phillip arrives at his mother's apron. He stares at the kids
with relish. In the near window, Ruth and Naomi steal a look
through the window.
GLADYS
We're Jehovah's Witness.
Superman locks eyes with Phillip.
SUPERMAN
Hey, Phillip Perry.
PHILLIP
Hey, Billy Reeves.
SUPERMAN
How'd ya' know it was me?
GLADYS
Go eat your supper, Phillip.
MR. HUGHES
Come on, kids. Let's go to the next
house. Sorry for the bother.
Gladys closes the door firmly and locks it.
6   EXT. HUNTSVILLE STATE PRISON - NIGHT                        6
A green Impala pulls up to the main entrance and stops. A
GUARD steps from his office to greet the driver, LARRY, a
pudgy 55-year-old prison employee wearing a loud plaid jacket.
GUARD
Evenin', Larry.   Forget somethin'?
LARRY
Goin' to Austin tomorrow.      Gonna' take
some work with me.
GUARD
Work, work, work. When you and me gonna'
go out and grab a cold one?
LARRY
Sooner the better.
The gate opens and the Impala passes.

BUTCH HAYNES, a 38-year-old inmate who reeks with knowledge
procured from the wrong side of the tracks, but whose sad,
tired eyes bemoan a maximum of regret, stands on the top of a
cell bunk chipping at the ceiling.
JERRY PUGH, 29, rail thin, a punk who constantly licks his
lips, keeps watch at the door. An OLD TIMER sits on his bunk
and watches both with a cautious eye.
Butch chips through to something.
BUTCH
Damn if the old man ain't right.
Jerry smiles, turns and grabs the old man by the shirt.
JERRY
And this goes to the roof?
OLD TIMER
Used to... afore they walled it over.
JERRY
If it don't I'm gonna' rip your tongue out.
OLD TIMER
Get yer' damn hands off me!
Jerry laughs and joins Butch, who is already well on his way
to bending open a slot in a corrugated metal air shaft hidden
behind the wall.
8   EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT                                      8
Superman and Dancing Skeleton, no longer with adult super-
vision, fill water balloons at an outdoor water spigot.
SUPERMAN
Make 'em small so you can heave 'em.
9   INT. PERRY HOUSE - NIGHT                                       9
An assembly line at the kitchen sink as the twins wash and
Phillip dries the evening dishes. Gladys sits at the kitchen
table, reading religious pamphlets and keeping a watchful eye
over the process.
Several THUDS resound through the house.
PHYLLIS
What in the world?
Phillip jumps down off his stool and races into the living
room.

wilts in the Texas sun, stops, and tosses down the file box
in anger.
The Airstream stops. LAUGHTER from inside and a   few AD LIBS,

turns his gaze back inside and the laughter and  comments stop

Phillip screams, grabs Butch and holds him up.

Damn, Buzz, shot twice in the same day."|unknown

No weapon, Chief!"|unknown

ROADSIDE
Red walks   up to Bobby Lee, stops and stares at the grinning
marksman.    After a beat, Red turns then nearly jumps out of
shoes with   a sudden right cross that floors the younger man.
Red starts   to jump in for more but Hendricks, stunned, jumps
in, grabs   Red and, joined by four other Officers, holds the
older man   back. Shouting, i.e. ""Hey, hey, Red, whoa, whoa!""
Red settles a bit. Hendricks turns to Bobby Lee who rises
to one knee and wipes at a bloody lip, and then to Red who
is still breathing hard."|stage direction

stops, his eyes following Red.
Sally, nearby, watches Red walk away.
PHILLIP
is helped to his feet by his mother. She holds him dearly
to her chest. He hugs back just as hard, his blood-stained
Casper outfit staining her blouse. She unzips the costume
and dollar bills fly all around. She starts to lead
Phillip off but he won't leave until...
He pulls the postcard from Butch's hand.
CLOSEUP - PHILLIP
Staring down at Butch.
CLOSEUP - BUTCH
His eyes flutter a bit with recognition.
AT PATROL CAR
Red leans against the car.   After a few seconds Sally walks
up and finds a spot a few feet down from him where she, too,
leans against the car. After a few more seconds."|stage direction

stuffs a chunk into his mouth.
IN FIELD - CLOSEUP - BUTCH
He licks his lips as the MUFFLED VOICES CONTINUE around
him. He squints hard and sees:
HELICOPTER
as it lifts off and speeds away.    As it wipes the sun...
CLOSEUP - BUTCH
A slight smile crosses his dying face as he squints to
see Phillip's flight.
CLOSEUP - PHILLIP
Nose pressed against the glass bubble.
BUTCH
His eyes don't close, still squinted but frozen.
CLOSEUP - EYES
We realize now, are lifeless.
BUZZARD
continues its flight past the sun.
SUN
flares, SENDING the SCREEN TO:
MILKY WHITE IMAGE
that opened the film."|stage direction
