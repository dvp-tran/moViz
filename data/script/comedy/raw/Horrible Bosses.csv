JENNA (V.O.)
Our last date was two weeks ago.
You haven't called me since."|speech

across from him."|speech
41|HARKEN|"Here's my concern, Nick. You're a
punctual guy. You understand the

security system. What do you
think?"|speech

have been a minute late."|speech

longtime security coordinator."|speech
