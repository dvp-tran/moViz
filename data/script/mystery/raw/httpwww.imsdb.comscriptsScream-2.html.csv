struggles with his seat belt. He looks up to see a
Ghost Masked Figure move around the side of the car
towards his door. He reaches for his gun but it's too
late. The Ghost has the door open.
A flash of silver and the Police Guard's throat is
slit.

gets in, behind the driver's seat. The Ghost puts the

IN THE BACKSEAT
Sidney is beyond frantic. She eyes the Ghost through
the gate. She turns and twists looking for an escape.
Through the window, she sees approaching headlights.
She SCREAMS through the closed window as a car passes
by.
Sidney takes notice as the car turns onto another
campus street. Big, stone school buildings line each
side of a thin, road.
She eyes the Ghost through the rearview window. The
white masks turns as hidden eyes bore through her. The
Ghost hits the gas, picking up speed.
Sidney looks to the book bag on the seat beside her.
She rips it open, rustling through it frantically. She
pulls books, pencils, paper... Sid grabs a long, yellow
No.2 pencil. She grips it hard, looking to the metal
grate just behind the driver's seat. The Ghost's neck
is right up against it.
Sid takes the pencil and positions it right behind the
Ghost's head, ready to attack.
Without pause, Sid RAMS the pencil through the grate,
into the Ghost's neck. It lodges there as the Ghost
falls forward in pain, losing control of the wheel for
a moment.
The car jumps the curb and SLAMS against a building.
The Ghost yanks the wheel, over correcting. He tries to
bring it back to the road but doesn't see the lamp post
that stands directly in the car's path.
The Squad car makes direct contact with the lamp post,
SLAMMING into it, bringing the car to a CRASHING HALT,
lodging it agaisnt the building's stone exterior.
Smoke rises from a bashed engine as it emits a fatal
rumbling.
INSIDE THE CAR
All is still. In the backseat, Sidney rises from the
floorboards. She looks up to see the Ghost Masked
figure slumped over the steering wheel. Out.
Sid quickly pulls herself together, looking about,
sizing up her options. She tugs on the door handle. It
won't budge. She looks to the passenger's side of the
car. It's flush against the building.
Then she notices the metal grate. The edge has been
pried apart in the crash. Sidney reaches for it,
pulling on it, bending it backwards...
CREAK!
Sid tries to stifle the noise it makes, all the while
eyeing the Ghost who remains unconscious. She creates
an opening large enough for her to crawl through. She
lifts herself up and pulls herself through to the...
FRONT SEAT
Sid falls down into the seat, her eyes never leaving
the Ghost. She lay crumpled up against the smashed
passenger's door, the only sound is her own TERRIFIED
BREATHING. She watches the Ghost Masked Figure. His
body doesn't move. She contemplates her next move.
The only way out is through the driver's door.
After what seems an eternity, she slowly reaches over
with her foot and nudges the Ghost. No movement.
Nothing.
She slides across the seat towards the Ghost, moving to
his side. She reaches with her hand and pushes on the
Ghost's shoulder. His body moves, slumping back against
the back of the seat. It clears space for her to pass
through.
She sits up on her feet, facing the Ghost. With her
leg, she reaches over him, straddling him. She leans
against the steering wheel, her arm quickly reaching
for the door knob.
HONK!
Her back brushes against the horn. Sid TENSES, her face
a little more than a foot from the Ghost Mask. He
doesn't move. He's completely out cold. Sid pushes the
car door open and starts to slide completely over the
Ghost when she stops.
She looks to the Ghost.
CLOSE ON HER FACE
As she fights with a decision. Then, with a fierce
determination, Sid reaches for the Ghost Mask. She
finds the edge and begins to peels the Mask away
when...
THE GHOST COMES TO LIFE
Lunging forward. Sidney SCREAMS, leaping, falling out
the car door.
OUTSIDE THE CAR
BAM!
Sid hits the pavement hard. She lifts herself up when
her entire body is YANKED VIOLENTLY BACKWARDS.
The Ghost has hold of her foot, pulling her back into
the car. Sidney KICKS and WRITHES breaking free. She
hops to her feet as the Ghost emerges from the car.
Sidney SLAMS the car door shut. It catches the Ghost,
knocking him backwards.

wall of the set that's dressed with framed pictures and
antique weapons and...
DEWEY
Who hangs from it, pinned up against the wall, very
much deadk, arms outstretched, crucified. His body a
bloody mess. Sidney stops, stunned. She stands frozen
in unspeakable horror. Her entire being ripped apart.
She breaks into tears. And then...
Sid backs up, moving, racing toward the wings when
another wall flies in, sealing the backstage area off,
trapping her. She looks in shock at...
HALLIE
Strung up, her body hanging lifeless. Sid SCREAMS,
turning, running to the other side of the stage when a
third wall comes flying in, creating the three walled
set of DEATHTRAP.
Attached to it, is the body of Joel. Dead. Blood
everywhere. And then, Sid hears...
CLAPPING!
A single pair of hands from somewhere in the house...
applauding. She turns around and spots a FIGURE moving
down the aisle. She can't make out who it is.
Sid bolts. She spots the set door up center, near
Dewey's body. She goes for it, ripping it open to
find...
COTTON WEARY STANDING IN THE DOORFRAME
Sid SCREAMS. But then sees his face, he looks scared.
And then, Cotton's body falls forward to the floor, his
arms and legs bound by electric tape.
Sid turns back to the front of the stage. The Figure is
now walking across the bridge, holding something... a
light attached to a video camera. She's being filmed.
Sid looks back to Cotton who looks up to her with
pleading eyes."|stage direction

the audience like that. Could you
cheat a little forward for me?"|speech
1260|COTTON|Please, Sidney.|speech
1261|DEREK|"You're really stumped, aren't you?
You know there's two killers but
you don't know who they are. I'm a

appears to be dead. Except for
Cotton. Hmmm? Hmmm?"|speech

Well, Derek and I have this whole

dedicated a whole page to you."|speech

more cruel?"|speech
1303|SIDNEY|"You're not going to get away with
this."|speech
1304|HALLIE|"Of course not. Who wants to? What's
the point if we don't get caught?
Where's the glamour in that?"|speech
1305|DEREK|"The way I see it. We'll be
arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on
the home footage. Secure a book
deal. If all goes as planned, our
trial should coincide with the
release of STAB II."|speech
1306|HALLIE|"A verdict and premiere all on the
same day. I love it."|speech

loosened them somewhat. He tries to finish undoing
them."|stage direction
1311|HALLIE|A twist ending if you will.|speech
1312|DEREK|"Yeah, we really had our work cut
out for us. It really is the curse
of the sequel. The Billy/Stu
thing's been done."|speech
1313|HALLIE|"... so we had to be different but
yet the same because if you venture
to far away from your orginal story
you completely alienate the
audience..."|speech

We wanted to give you your money's
worth."|speech

message to Hollywood. I'm really
getting tired of all the happy
endings. It's just not reality. In
the real world the good guys die,
the innocent are punished, and the
murderers inherit the earth."|speech

never go. They'll rewrite you. You
don't want that."|speech

your son."|speech
