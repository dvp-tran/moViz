1   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                 1
An expensive bathroom suite. Excess of marble and gold
taps. Into the bath, a hand is scattering rupee notes.
Hundreds and hundreds of notes, worth hundreds of
thousands of rupees. The sound of a fist thumping on
the bathroom door, furious shouting from the other
side.
JAVED O/S
Salim! Salim!
2   INT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. DAY.                              2
Darkness. Then, glimpses of faces. In the half-light,
shadowy figures move with purpose. An implacable voice
announces.
TALKBACK V/O
Ten to white-out, nine, eight,
seven...
PREM
Are you ready?
Silence. A hand shakes a shoulder a little too roughly.
PREM (CONT'D)
I said are you ready?
JAMAL
Yes.
3   INT. JAVED'S SAFE-HOUSE. BATHROOM. NIGHT.                 3
The thumping at the door continues. The sound of
mumbled Indian prayer. Dull gleam of a pistol. A hand
cracks the chamber open. Loads a single bullet into the
chamber, snaps the chamber shut.
TALKBACK V/O
...three, two, one, zero. Cue
Prem, cue applause...
Suddenly, the door splinters as it is smashed through.
A burst of gun-fire and white light as suddenly...
4   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                       4
...we are back in the studio, the gun-fire morphing
into rapturous applause.

TALKBACK V/O
Go, Prem.
A wall of light and noise as the two walk on stage.
Cheering, music, banks of searing studio lights. On
stage, Jamal, an eighteen year-old Indian boy-man
stares, petrified. He would surely turn and run but for
the iron grip on his shoulder of the smiling host, Prem
Kumar.
PREM
Welcome to Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire!
More applause.
PREM (CONT'D)
Please give a warm welcome to
our first contestant of the
night- a local from our very own
Mumbai!
Under cover of the wild applause, Prem ushers Jamal
towards the guest's chair, leaning in and hissing.
PREM (CONT'D)
Smile, dammit.
The lights seem to bore into him but Jamal manages a
tentative smile. Out of nowhere, a hand slaps him
ferociously across the face. Then again and again.
Blood trickles from his mouth.
5   INT. POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM. NIGHT.                               5
The studio lights have seamlessly transformed into the
harsh bulb of an interrogation light. Jamal is strung
from the ceiling by his arms.
CONSTABLE SRINIVAS
Your name, bhen chod.
Constable Srinivas's hand pulls back Jamal's head by
the hair, forcing him to stare directly into the
lights.
CONSTABLE SRINIVAS (CONT'D)
Your name!
JAMAL
Jamal Malik.
And seamlessly we are back....

...on the set of Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Prem
leans back in his chair, a man at home in his
surroundings. Jamal sits opposite, frozen.
PREM
So, Jamal, tell us a bit about
yourself.
Close on Jamal's face. Without warning, it is shoved
under water.
7   INT. BUCKET. NIGHT.                                         7
We look up from the bottom of the bucket at the
screaming face of a drowning man. His head shakes
desperately, pointlessly. Then Jamal's face is dragged
up again, roaring for breath. Close on his eyes.
JAMAL V/O
I work in a call centre. In
Juhu.
8   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                         8
PREM
A Phone-basher! And what type of
call centre would this be?
JAMAL
XL 5. Mobile phones.
PREM
Aha! So, you're the man who
rings me up every single day of
my life with Special Offers,
huh?
JAMAL
No, actually, I'm an assistant.
PREM
An Assistant Phone-basher?
A raised eye-brow at the audience. Amusement ruffles
through them.
PREM (CONT'D)
And what does an Assistant Phone-
basher do, exactly?
JAMAL
I- I get tea for people and-

head is bowed and he is moaning to himself. The ceiling
fan thumps round slowly. In the corner, Constable
Srinivas mops his brow and lights a cigarette. Hot
work. The door opens and the Inspector of Police walks
in. A rumpled man in his late forties who has seen
pretty much everything. He eyes Jamal, surprised."|stage direction||

screams. His body goes limp again. The Inspector goes
over to Jamal."|stage direction||

you save us both a lot of time?
Hmm?"|speech|INSPECTOR|M

down. Looks at his watch, nods at Constable Srinivas
again. Jamal's body jerks with electric current. When
the shudders and screams have subsided, the Inspector
goes over to Jamal's collapsed form. Clicks his fingers
in front of Jamal's face to check for a response."|stage direction||

38||"Bright sunlight filtered through the ever-present
Mumbai dust. A group of children are playing cricket on
a tarmac cricket ground. They are bare-foot, dressed in
little more than rags, wiry-skinny and fast on their
feet. Salim, a nine-year old, polishes the ball on his
almost non-existent shorts, comes in with surprising
speed and bowls. The batsman hooks it high in the air.
The bowler screams at a boy in the outfield."|stage direction||

42||"He pays no heed to the rest of the children who are
scattering fast to the edges of the tarmac. The ball
seems suspended in the blue sky. Shouts from the other
children seem very far away. He doesn't notice that
they are screaming for him to get out of the way. Jamal
adjusts his feet for the perfect catch. Then out of
nowhere, a light aircraft almost takes his head off as
it comes in to land on the tarmac runway. Jamal is
knocked to his feet by the down-draft of the plane. The
ball bounces away. Also flattened, Salim gets to his
feet."|stage direction||

46||"At the back of a pack of children, carrying a piece of
wood crudely fashioned into a sword, Jamal is running
for his life, pursued by an ancient but surprisingly
nimble Security Guard from the airport who is screaming
abuse and wielding a long stick. The kids dash across a
rubbish dump and disappear down dozens of tiny lanes
that run in between the shacks of the slum."|stage direction||
47|SECURITY GUARD|"Private-ka land! Private-ka
land! The planes won't kill you,
mader chod, I will!"|speech|SECURITY GUARD|M

head down a separate lane. The Guard pursues them."|stage direction||

50||"The lanes in between the corrugated iron shacks are
three feet wide, with an open drain running down the
middle. Many of the precarious upper floors of the
shacks have been built right over the paths, turning
them into black tunnels. Tunnels shot through with
slivers of light. If you didn't live here, you would be
lost and frightened in minutes.
But these children are natives and with the practice of
many years, Jamal and Salim zig-zag down the warren of
lanes.
They dodge past people cooking in the doorways,
sleeping, washing clothes or in the case of Vinod, a
naked four year-old, pissing into the drain. Salim
shouts a warning."|stage direction||

through!"|speech|SALIM|M
53||"Without breaking step, they both jump expertly over the
stream of piss. Not so the Security Guard who gets it
all over his trousers, but doesn't stop the pursuit.
The two children charge past a shack filled to the roof
with chickens in cages who all start squawking. They
break out into the sunlight of the `main road' of the
slum lined with shops. It is packed: with people,
stalls, bicycles and cows. All modern India is here,
drinking tea, shouting at each other, selling food,
playing carom, video games. Leaving a trail of shouting
and wreckage behind them, the pair approach a brand new
Mercedes almost blocking the lane. Beside it stands
Javed, an impressive man in a beautiful suit and his
two Minders. Jamal and Salim skid to a stop, put their
hands together in respectful greeting and edge ever so
carefully past the immaculate paintwork of the car.
Still in pursuit, the Security Guard also slides
carefully past the car with deprecating bows and
smiles. On past the chi stall where a crowd has
gathered to watch a hindi film blaring from the tv
rigged up overhead. The irate Security Guard gets
tangled up in a bicycle. Jamal and Salim stop to give
him a taunting, hip-gyrating parody of the dance on the
tv before scooting down another tunnel. They break out
into sunlight again."|stage direction||

Jamal. Upside down and still outside the train, he is
clearly being dangled by his ankles from the train

who manoeuvres him across, dips his hand into the open
window, snatches a chapatti and signals franticly to be
hoisted up. The family continue to eat, unperturbed.
Then Jamal appears again. This time one of the children
spots him. Despite Jamal giving her a friendly wave,
she yelps. The father of the group grabs Jamal's hand
which has just snatched a samosa. There is a tussle,
Salim holding onto Jamal's legs, the father holding
onto Jamal's arms and Jamal in the middle, shouting.

tumbling down an embankment in slow-motion.

doorways or lean out of upstairs windows. They are
garishly-dressed prostitutes varying in age from 13 to
60. Men wander past, eying the possibilities,
exchanging lewd comments with them. Among the hordes on
the pavement are Jamal and Salim. They pass doorway
after doorway of narrow rooms where prostitutes wait
for customers. Jamal and Salim stop at each group of
women, Salim taking the lead, clearly asking them
something, as the women either shrug or offer them
something lewd- judging by the laughter that follows.
But one woman in a narrow doorway points down the
street. Jamal has to drag a reluctant Salim away from
the group."|stage direction||

The digital clocks show five fifteen. Shoving the
descending river of people out of his way, the
seventeen year-old Jamal is forging a path up steps
that cross the platforms. He pushes to the middle of
the footbridge and leans out on the side railings. He
scans the sea of people, desperately. Then he sees her:
the eighteen year-old Latika, heart-stoppingly
beautiful, over the other side of the station. A world
away. She is scanning the crowd, as wired as he is.

Latika! Latika!

swallowed by the noise around him. Then he sees two
thuggish-looking men also fighting a way towards her.

figure against an army of white-robed people. He gets
to the bottom of the steps, is making progress against
the tide. But so are the two men. Jamal is now on the
same platform. Shouts her name again. She turns with a
smile. But the two Thugs leap through a train onto her
platform. She sees them, starts running, is lost in the
crowd. Jamal runs off along the platform after Latika.

was- she is gone. He whirls around, mad with
frustration.

down and drags her across to Javed's waiting Mercedes.
Salim is standing by the car. Jamal pushes through the
crowds just in time to see Salim bundling her into the
car.

Did Jamal Malik, an uneducated,
eighteen year-old boy from the

giggle next to Javed and a couple of his Thugs. Pouring
drinks at a sideboard is Latika. Javed glances up at

from Who Wants to be a Millionaire. Salim, too is
staring, wide-eyed at the tv. Javed picks up the
remote, doesn't even notice and switches over to a
music channel. Latika hurries out.
