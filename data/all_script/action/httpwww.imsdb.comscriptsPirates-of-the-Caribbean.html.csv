Out over the sea, moving through the fog, silent as a
ghost, is a large sailing ship, a schooner --
It has BLACK SAILS.
Elizabeth stares, too frightened to move, or cry out.
The ship is obscured by the fog it as it passes -- but not
the mizzen-top ... and there hangs the frightening skull
and crossbones of the Jolly Roger.
Elizabeth looks from it to the medallion -- the skull on
the flag is the same as the one on the medallion.
Fog surrounds and closes in on the black ship -- except for
the black flag. As Elizabeth watches, the skull appears to
TURN and GRIN at her --

Elizabeth, lying in bed in the dark.
She remains motionless (were the images we just saw a
nightmare, or a jumbled childhood memory?)
Elizabeth slowly looks as far out the corner of her eyes as
possible without moving. Might there be someone in the
room with her, looming over her?
She turns, ready for anything.   She is alone.
Elizabeth sits up, turns up the flame on an oil lamp
besides the canopied bed. She carries the lamp across the
room to a dressing table, sits down.
She pulls one of the small drawers all the way out, reaches
into a space beneath it and removes --
The MEDALLION. She has kept it all this time. It has not
lost its luster -- or its sense of menace. She gazes at it
as she absently returns the draw to its place --
A BOOMING knock on the door;    Elizabeth jumps up, startled

buccaneer rags, hang from gallows erected on a rocky
promontory. There is a fifth, unoccupied gallows, bearing a
sign:
PIRATES - YE BE WARNED.
The top of a billowing sail passes regally in front of
them. On the landward face of the sail, apparently high in
the rigging, is a man for whom the term 'swashbuckling
rogue' was coined: Captain JACK SPARROW.
He gazes keen-eyed at the display as they pass. Raises a
tankard in salute. Suddenly, something below catches his
attention. He jumps from the rigging -
-- and that's when we see that his is ship is not an
imposing three-master, but just a small fishing dory with a
single sail, plowing through the water -- the Jolly Mon.
And it leaks. Which is why he has the tankard: to bail.
Jack steps back to the tiller, and using a single sheet to
control the sail, and the Jolly Mon comes around the
promontory, the whole of Port Royal laid out before him.
The huge British dreadnought, H.M.S. Dauntless dominates
the bay. But Jack's attention is on a different ship: the
H.M.S. Interceptor, a small sleek vessel with rail guns and
a mortar in the middle of the main deck. It is tied up at

Charles."|stage direction

steps forward, pins a medal to Norrington's jacket, steps
back.
Norrington nods, turns smartly and nods to his fellow

dignitaries, merchants, plantation owners, their families.
Another flourish, and he returns the sword to its scabbard.

tool is in place; the workbench is   tidy and neat.

blacksmith's apron, snores in the corner, cradling a
bottle. Jack gives him a hard poke. Another. Brown snorts,
turns away.
Satisfied, Jack sheathes his sword, takes a short-handled
sledge from its place on the wall. Moves to the glowing
coke furnace in the middle of the room.
Slowly... he holds his right hand over the furnace, the
chain down in the embers. The chain begins to GLOW. Jack
sweats, grimaces at the pain -
Moving quickly, he wraps the chain around the nose of an
anvil, brings the sledge down with a fast, hard stroke on
the glowing links. One SHATTERS. Jack drops the sledge,
plunges his manacled hand in a bucket of water. Steam
billows.
Jack pulls his hand out, flexes it. Blisters form beneath
