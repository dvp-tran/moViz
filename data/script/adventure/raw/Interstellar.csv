1||"SPACE.
But not the dark lonely corner of it we're used to. This is
a glittering inferno -- the center of a distant galaxy.
Suddenly, something TEARS past at incredible speed: a NEUTRON
STAR. It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters...
planets, stars. Can anything stop this juggernaut?
Yes. Something looms at the heart of the galaxy, hidden
inside the blinding starlight, a dark flaw in the fabric of
existence itself: a BLACK HOLE.
The neutron star is pulled into the black hole's swirl,
spiraling closer and closer to destruction. Finally, it
contacts the hole's edge and EXPLODES.
The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into
the fabric of space-time itself. We ride one of these waves,
racing back out from the black hole.
Suddenly, a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal-
like hole, emerging in a much darker region of the universe --
a backwater that, as the wave races past a giant red planet
with a distinctive eye, we recognize as our own.
The wave, now just an infinitesimal ripple, finally reaches
our blue planet. It drops into our atmosphere over North
America, toward the high desert east of the Cascades, and
through the roof of a nondescript warehouse.
The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum
chamber, then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected
in a heavy piece of glass.
The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in
the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a
concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert.
An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it
parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end
of the tube. A MAN climbs out of the SUV."|stage direction

Control. He pours himself a cup of coffee. It is the weekend
and the place is empty. No one has been there to see the
displays flashing a distinctive shape -- a pulse followed by
a series of echoes.
The man looks up at the screen, then DROPS his cup of coffee."|stage direction

headquarters at Caltech is a frenzy of activity. POSTDOCS
and RESEARCHERS huddle around monitors and printouts, arguing.
ANSEN, 60s, the director of LIGO, walks through the frenzy.
A postdoc hands him a printout: a pulse followed by echoes."|stage direction

8||"Ansen steps into the relative calm of a large, sunlit office,
which overlooks a grassy stretch of Caltech's campus.
His ASSISTANT, 30s, is on the phone, on hold. He looks up
at Ansen as he enters."|stage direction

check the triangulation before we"|speech

13|ASSISTANT|"Yes. I'm trying to reach-
(pause, listens)
No, I don't think you understand how
serious this is."|speech
14|(PAUSE)|"Because if you did, we'd be having
this conversation in person."|speech
15||He listens for a moment, then hangs up the phone, confused.|stage direction
16|ANSEN|What did they say?|speech
17|ASSISTANT|"They said we should look out the
window."|speech
18||"Ansen steps to the window and looks out:
In the courtyard below, coeds are scrambling to get out of
the way as a military helicopter sets down in the middle of
the quad and dozens of ARMED FEDERAL AGENTS converge on his
building."|stage direction

20||INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM, LIGO, CALTECH -- DAY|location
21||"Ansen sits, alone, on one side of a conference table.
The other side is filled with GOVERNMENT MEN -- NSA mostly,
some DIA. The door opens and his assistant steps in. Armed
guards pat him down, then shove him into a seat."|stage direction
22|ANSEN|Is that really necessary?|speech
23||One of the NSA agents leans forward.|stage direction
24|NSA AGENT|"You've been complaining for years
that the government doesn't take
your project seriously enough, Doctor."|speech
25|(SMILES)|You can't have it both ways.|speech
26||"Ansen motions to his assistant, who turns on a projector.
On-screen, we see the familiar pulse and echoes."|stage direction
27|ANSEN|"Yesterday morning, our facility in
Hanford identified this signal: a
neutron star colliding with a
supermassive black hole. We went
through the last year's data and
triangulated the source."|speech
28||"The pulse is translated into a crude animatic of a neutron
star circling into the black hole."|stage direction
29|NSA AGENT|"We know that, Doctor. What we don't
know is why, according to your
numbers, this event took place right
here in our own solar system."|speech
30||"Suddenly, the image overlays the sun, the earth, and the
rest of our solar system around the black hole."|stage direction
31|ANSEN|"It didn't. Because if it had we'd
all be dead by now."|speech
32||"On-screen, Jupiter, then the Earth and the inner planets are
consumed by the black hole. Only the sun survives, pulled
into orbit around its new master."|stage direction
33|ANSEN (CONT'D)|"Which leaves only one explanation:
The signal traveled through a"|speech
34|(MORE)|4.|speech
35|ANSEN (CONT'D)|"wormhole. A gateway to a distant
corner of the universe. The black
hole is on the far side."|speech
36||"On-screen, the black hole system is removed to a distant
corner, connected to ours by a tunnel through space-time. A
gravity wave from the collision travels through the tunnel."|stage direction
37|NSA AGENT|"I've read your book, Doctor. You
said that wormholes are impossible."|speech
38|ANSEN|"There is nothing quite as satisfying
as being proved utterly wrong."|speech
39|(SMILES)|"I said that a wormhole couldn't exist
naturally. Not for more than a few
billionths of a second. It would
have to be... stabilized."|speech
40|NSA AGENT|Stabilized by what?|speech
41||Ansen pauses, unsure. His assistant steps in to his defense.|stage direction
42|ASSISTANT|"We don't have any way to answer that
question."|speech
43|"NSA AGENT
(IGNORES HIM)"|"You're not under peer review here,
Doctor. I don't care about your
reputation. I need to know how that
thing got there. Now."|speech
44||Ansen finally speaks up.|stage direction
45|ANSEN|"If you're worried about an invasion,
I would start drafting the articles
of surrender."|speech
46|(SMILES)|"Whoever they are, if they can build
a wormhole, they could erase us in
the blink of an eye. Luckily, that
also means we have nothing they could
be interested in."|speech
47|NSA AGENT|"Then why is it there?
5."|speech
48|ANSEN|"I don't know. Maybe it's an
invitation. A chance to commune
with an advanced species."|speech
49||The assistant, embarrassed, looks down. The agent notices.|stage direction
50|NSA AGENT|You don't agree?|speech
51|"ASSISTANT
(DELICATE)"|"No. I don't think we can assume an
alien intelligence built the wormhole."|speech
52|(CHANGES TACK)|"But the opportunity it represents is
incredible. We could explore parts
of the universe we never dreamt of
reaching in our lifetimes."|speech
53||"The agent exchanges a look with one of his colleagues, who
steps out of the room."|stage direction
54|ANSEN|"We need to get back to work. I have
a conference call with our European
partners in fifteen minutes."|speech
55|NSA AGENT|"We severed the connections to your
European partners this morning."|speech
56|"ANSEN
(INDIGNANT)"|"You can't do that. The Europeans
put up some of the funding..."|speech
57|GOVERNMENT MAN|We'll send them a check.|speech
58|(STANDS)|"Your project is now classified under
the State Secrets Act."|speech
59||"He steps out the door, leaving the men alone. The assistant,
outraged, turns back to his boss."|stage direction
60|ASSISTANT|"They can't keep this a secret. You
know that. Sooner or later..."|speech
61||"The younger man looks down, embarrassed, as he notices that
tears are rolling down the older man's cheeks."|stage direction
62|ASSISTANT|6.|speech
63|ANSEN|"I don't care about that. I've spent
my whole life being afraid we would
wipe ourselves out before this moment
arrived. We've made so many mistakes,
I wasn't sure we'd make it..."|speech

91|COOPER|"(shakes his head)
Satellite. Big one. Probably
Chinese."|speech

the upper atmosphere.
After a moment, play resumes -- it's a pretty show, but
everyone has seen it plenty of times before.
Down on the field, the Dodgers' catcher misses an easy pop

grew up watching."|speech

dad?"|speech

will happen. All kinds of things.
Good or bad. And that's the way you
want it to be."|speech

143||"Then Cooper hears it, too. A LOW RUMBLING SOUND. Cooper
looks out over the river. Then he turns back and tackles
his son to the ground.
Suddenly, a MASSIVE AIRPLANE SOARS overhead, so close they
can almost touch it. It bounces the truck on its suspension,
then soars off over the fields behind them.
Cooper grabs Murph and races back to the truck. He pulls a
laptop and an antenna made out of a Pringles can out of the
back of the truck. He hands the laptop and antenna to Murph."|stage direction

like an old U-2 surveillance plane, but no cockpit. The
tops of its wings are covered in black solar cells."|stage direction

It's a beautiful sight.
Cooper crouches next to Murph."|stage direction

the pictures.
MS. KELLY
This is one of the old federal
textbooks. We've replaced them with
corrected versions."|speech

MS. KELLY
The new textbooks explain that the
Apollo lunar missions were faked in
order to bankrupt the Soviet Union."|speech
233|COOPER|"You don't believe we went to the
moon?

Yes, Mr. Cooper. The kind of
wastefulness and excess that the
20th century represented. Your

shuffles back and forth, trying to get himself into position.
But the ball never returns. The catcher YELLS out a warning.
Above, the ball begins to slowly fall up, not down, toward
the town center above.
After a second, the ball smashes through a skylight of a
building high above them.
Cooper watches as the kid rounds the bases, laughing."|stage direction

2075||"A maintenance worker finishes looking over one of the sleek-
looking spacecraft. He packs up his tools and heads out.
After a moment, two figures pick their way across the hangar
floor, sticking to the shadows.
As they reach the first ship in the line, we get a better
look. It's Cooper and his robot pal. The robot is wearing
a baseball cap and carrying a toolbox.
Cooper gestures to the robot, who sets down the toolbox with
a click against the mirror-like floor.
Cooper shakes his head, annoyed, at the robot, and puts his
finger to his lips. The robot nods, bashful.
Cooper waves a small handheld computer near the skin of the
ship until it lights up. Then he punches in a few codes.
Nothing happens. He punches in a few more."|stage direction
