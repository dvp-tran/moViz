9||"The barman, wiping down the counter, gives an occasional
semi-furtive glance toward the far end of the bar.
Other patrons chat near the bartender and also give occasional
glances toward the far end of the bar. It is early evening --
happy hour -- and the clientele is well-heeled and sociable.
A customer says something interrogative to the bartender,
who looks down the bar and shrugs.
REVERSE - CAMERA CONTINUES MOVEMENT (Notes the combination
of the HIGH ANGLE and the tilt of Santa's head keep his face
from being clearly revealed in this scene).
Sitting alone at the far end of the bar, given a wide berth
by the other customers, a man (WILLIE) stares morosely into
his drink. The drink is clearly not his first.
He wears a red velvet suit and red velvet hat with a white
pom-pom. He has shiny black boots with red velvet trim. His
long white beard is not real and is in fact pulled down below
his chin to facilitate drinking. It exposes heavy black
stubble.
Swaying slightly, he raises the drink to the vicinity of his
lips. Once it gets close he must navigate it in with some
effortful coordination. He takes a sip and sets the drink
carefully back down.
After another long, staring, morose beat, he starts weeping.
It is loud, dolorous, and unself-conscious."|stage direction

11||"Santa staggers out the back door...
CAMERA FOLLOWS BEHIND HIM still hiding his face.
Santa gets about ten feet, then pauses and leans with one
hand against the alley wall, uses the other to hold his pom-
pom out of the way, and vomits.
Having vomited, and spit, he staggers off toward the street.

Some children may not want to smile.
It is your job to coax a smile out

Marcus swings at the mannequin's knees with a golf club.
Willie uses a plasma welder on the safe.
Marcus, having chopped down the mannequin, drags off its
stole.
Willie is back over the safe, battering it with the
sledgehammer, roaring with each swing.
Marcus is in Housewares pilfering crock pots.
Willie, sweating, drops the sledgehammer clanking to the
floor. Wiping his forehead, he circles the safe. When he
gets to the back of the safe he stops, thinks.
Marcus is in Home Entertainment grabbing a stereo.
Willie is hunched at the back of the safe, stethoscope to
its surface, giving exploratory taps with two knuckles.
Sound perspective through the stethoscope: hollow THUNKS
followed by an unnaturally loud and present CREEEEEEEEAK.
Willie reacts quizzically. After a considering moment he
rises. we can see, on the far side of the safe, its door as

picture: Lois has a shopping cart filled with shoes, scarves,
jewels, a salad spinner, purses, a block of Ginsu knives, an
abdomen exerciser. She wears a pair of sunglasses from which
a price tag dangles, and a long ermine stole.

Drawn by the noise, an adorable six-year-old in a nearby

HIS HIGH POV:
Frozen in a semi-circle at the foot of the neighboring lawn,
an army of cops has guns trained on the felled Santa Claus,
who is sprawled on the neighbor's stoop, motionless. His
hand stretches toward the front door holding a fluffy pink
elephant un-delivered...
The six year old draws in his breath and SCREAMS.
He is joined by his equally adorable little brother and sister
who look, and SCREAM, with him.

know I wrote it, which is gonna keep
my ass out of jail. That, plus
everyone agreeing that the Phoenix
police department shooting an unarmed
Santa was even more fucked-up than
Rodney King. The cops are treating
me like fucking royalty now which is
new in my experience. They are gonna
make me a sensitivity counselor so
