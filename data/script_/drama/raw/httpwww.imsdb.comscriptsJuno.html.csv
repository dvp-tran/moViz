curbside by its former owners. There is a fetid-looking
leather recliner, a chrome-edged coffee table, and a tasteless
latchhooked rug featuring a roaring tiger."|stage direction

1377||INT. HOSPITAL - BIRTHING SUITE - DAY|location
1378||"Juno is curled up on her bed in the birthing room. The birth
is obviously over; there's that air of stillness and
accomplishment, a task completed. The doctors have cleared
out. Mac sits in a chair next to the bed, looking like he's
not sure what to say.
He holds up a deck of Playing cards as if to initiate a game,
but Juno gently pushes his hand away. Their eyes meet. His
expression is helpless, hers is utterly drained."|stage direction
1379|MAC|"Someday, you'll be back here, honey.
On your terms."|speech
1380||"Juno nods and swallows.
Over Mac's shoulder, a silhouette appears in the doorway.
It's Bleeker in his track uniform.
Juno sees him and bursts into sudden, ragged sobs. Mac glances
at her, alarmed. Paulie moves toward the bed. Mac clears his
throat, gets up and leaves the room.
Paulie climbs onto the hospital bed and carefully puts his
arm around Juno. She leans into him, letting herself go for
the first time in months."|stage direction
1381||INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - BIRTHING SUITE - EVENING|location
1382||"Juno lies on the bed. She looks rested and relaxed compared
to her earlier crying jag, but her face is still pink and
swollen. Bleeker is curled up next to her, still in his track
uniform and spikes."|stage direction
1383|JUNO (V.O.)|"Bleeker decided he didn't want to
see the baby. Neither did I, really.
He didn't feel like ours."|speech
1384||INT. HOSPITAL - MATERNITY WARD - EVENING|location
1385||"We see Vanessa leaning over the bassinet, unable to take her
eyes off the baby, touching it's hair reverently."|stage direction
1386|JUNO (V.O.)|I think he was always hers.|speech
1387||INT. LORING HOUSE - NURSERY - DAY|location
1388||"The nursery is perfectly decorated in Vanessa's immaculate
taste. Nothing looks as though it's been touched. We see the
antique ROCKING CHAIR sitting empty."|stage direction
1389|JUNO (V.O.)|It ended with a chair.|speech
1390||"We pan past the wall Vanessa had said ""needed something.""
There's a framed note on the wall. It looks like it was
handwritten on the back of a Jiffy Lube bill. We see that it
says: ""Vanessa -- If you're still in, I'm still in. Juno.""
We move to the door and get a view of Vanessa's bedroom. We
see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her
shoulder, feeding the baby. For the first time ever, Vanessa
looks disorganized, unshowered -- and incredibly happy. There
are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet pushed
close to the bed. Obviously, she hasn't been away from the
baby for a single moment.
The baby reaches up and grabs Vanessa's thumb. Vanessa glows
with an expression of pure bliss."|stage direction
1391||EXT. MACGUFF HOUSE - DAY|location
1392||"It's a sparkling summer afternoon. Juno wheels her bicycle
out of the detached garage. She waves goodbye to Bren, who
is playing in the yard with two WEIMARANERS. She looks almost
as happy with her dogs as VANESSA looked with her baby."|stage direction
1393||EXT. SUBURBAN STREETS - DAY|location
1394||"Juno rides her bike aggressively down the street. Her guitar
is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag. She's obviously not
pregnant anymore. She looks happy, but older."|stage direction
1395|JUNO (V.O.)|"As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is
totally boss. He is the cheese to my
macaroni. I know people are supposed
to fall in love before they reproduce,
but normalcy's not really our style."|speech
1396||"As she tears recklessly down the street on her bikes, she
passes the Dancing Elk TRACK TEAM, still running in
outrageously skimpy shorts and bandanas.
Juno RIDES up to a garage where Bleeker is sitting, tuning
his guitar."|stage direction
1397||EXT. BLEEKER HOUSE - DAY|location
1398||"Juno bikes up to find Bleeker sitting on the stoop. She smiles
and takes out her guitar. She sits across from Bleeker and
pulls the pick out of the strings."|stage direction
1399|JUNO|Ready?|speech
1400||"Bleeker nods.
Juno begins strumming her guitar and playing ""Anyone Else
But You,"" by the Moldy Peaches. Bleeker joins in. At first
their playing is discordant, but suddenly it works."|stage direction
1401|BLEEKER|"You're a part time lover and a
fulltime friend. The monkey on your
back is the latest trend. I don't
see what anyone can see, in anyone
else but you."|speech
1402|JUNO|"Here is the church and here is the
steeple. We sure are cute for two
ugly people. I don't see what anyone
can see, in anyone else but you."|speech
1403|BLEEKER|"We both have shiny happy fits of
rage. You want more fans, I want
more stage. I don't see what anyone
can see, in anyone else but you."|speech
1404|JUNO|"You are always trying to keep it
real. I'm in love with how you feel.
I don't see what anyone can see, in
anyone else but you."|speech
1405|BLEEKER|"I kiss you on the brain in the shadow
of a train. I kiss you all starryeyed,
my body's swinging from side to side.
I don't see what anyone can see, in
anyone else but you."|speech
1406|JUNO|"The pebbles forgive me, the trees
forgive me. So why can't you forgive
me? I don't see what anyone can see,
in anyone else but you."|speech
1407|JUNO AND BLEEKER TOGETHER|"Du du du du du du dudu. Du du du du
du du dudu. I don't see what anyone
can see, in anyone else but you."|speech
1408||"She and Bleeker exchange glances as they play. They smile
ambiguously. Juno leans over and kisses Bleeker on the cheek.
Pull out to reveal the surrounding green suburb buzzing with
life and summer activity."|stage direction
