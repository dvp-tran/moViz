3|ADA (VO - Scs 2 to 7)|"The voice you hear is not my
speaking voice, but my mind's
voice.
I have not spoken since I was
six years old. No one knows
why, not even me. My father
says it is a dark talent and
the day I take it into my head
to stop breathing will be my
last.
Today he married me to a man
I've not yet met. Soon my
daughter and I shall join him
in his own country. My husband
said my muteness does not
bother him. He writes and hark
this: God loves dumb creatures,
so why not he!
Were good he had God's patience
for silence affects everyone in
the end. The strange thing is I
don't think myself silent, that
is, because of my piano. I
shall miss it on the journey."|speech

A woman in a dark crepe Victorian dress sits leaning against a tree,
her hands cover her face, around her neck she wears a writing pad. She
crosses a field with large bare trees, in the far background stands a
3 storey stone house.
Sc 3     INT     SCOTTISH HOUSE CORRIDOR     DAY     Sc 3
A small girl roller skates down a dimly lit corridor. A parlour maid
looks down the hall where the girl has disappeared.
Sc 4     INT     SCOTTISH HOUSE DRAWING ROOMDAY     Sc 4
Three men wearing long grey aprons are fitting the packing for a
piano. On one of the men's arms is a tattoo of a whale in a wild sea.
Sc 5     EXT     SCOTTISH HOUSE GROUNDS     DAY     Sc 5
The girl wearing her skates sits on a small black pony. An old man is
pulling it, but it won't move. (In the background, another aspect of
the grey stone house.)
Sc 6     INT     SCOTTISH HOUSE FLORA'S BEDROOM NIGHTSc 6
The woman lifts back the sheets from the bottom of the sleeping girl's
bed. She is still wearing her skates. The woman cuts through the laces
and removes the boots. One disembodied skate rolls across the room.
Sc 7     INT     SCOTTISH HOUSE DRAWING ROOMNIGHT     Sc 7
The woman stands at a window lit by moonlight. Her skin appears
luminescently white. She touches the wooden window frame, the curtain,
the objects on the window sill, her mind abstracted, her hands
unconsciously performing a farewell. Turning from the window she moves
to a square piano crowded by packing boxes. In the dim light she
begins to play strongly. Her face strains, she is utterly involved,
unaware other own strange guttural sounds that form an eerie
accompaniment to the music.
An old maid in night-dress looks in. Abruptly the woman stops playing.
The emotion leaves her face, it whitens and seems solid like a wall."|stage direction

Under water a long boat passes overhead, its oars breaking the
surface.
Sc 9     EXT     BEACH                    DAY     Sc 9
Amidst a riotous sea a woman, ADA, is carried to shore on the
shoulders of five seamen. Her large Victorian skirt spreads across the
men's arms and backs, on her head a black bonnet, around her neck her
pad and pen. We should be forgiven if this woman seems a sacrificial
offering as the bay they carry her to is completely uninhabited. A
black sand backs on to an endless rise of dense native bush.
The breakers are chaotic, the men strain to keep their footing,
calling to each other."|stage direction
7|SEAMEN|"Hold still you smutt! Blast the
boat!
Look up! Look up!
Lay to! Lay to.
Up with it you buggerers, hold
hard!
Damn me won't you hold?!
Etc."|speech
8||"Two of the men are black, all are battered, tattooed and tough, some
are drunk.
Behind the woman is her daughter, a girl of ten in Scottish dress. She
too is carried on the shoulders of seamen.
ADA is placed on the sand. She looks down at her feet sinking into the
wet sand, then up at the huge confusion of fern and bush in front of
her. The sound of sea behind is thunderous.
Several of the seamen have formed a group and are pissing on the sand.
Her daughter is on all fours evidently being sick. But ADA's attention
is diverted to the seamen who are staggering through the waves with a
huge piano shaped box. They put it down as soon as they get to 5hore
but ADA makes gestures that they must immediately bring it to higher
safer ground. The piano placed to her satisfaction she hovers near it,
one hand in constant touch of it while her daughter grips her free
hand.
Sc 10     EXT     BEACH                         DAY     Sc 10
TWO SEAMEN finish carrying the last crate to shore. Trunks and boxes
including an open crate with hens are scattered carelessly along the
shore.
The SEAMEN gather together. After a discussion in which they look
between ADA and her child and their Coaster out on the sea, one of the
men approaches. Behind him the other men keep their eyes out to sea or
down on the sand. They don't want to be involved. The sight of the
women alone on this beach is too hopeless."|stage direction

Could be they can't get through
to you in this weather. Maybe
they'll come over land."|speech

without emotion."|stage direction

17|SEAMEN|"Does your mother prefer to come
on with us to Nelson?"|speech

rather be boiled alive by
natives than get back in your

Sc 12     EXT     BEACH                         DAY     Sc 12
ADA is sheltering behind the crated piano, anxiety etched on her face.
FLORA  is asleep at her feet a half eaten biscuit in her hand ADA has
found a gap through the crate so that she might lift the lid and play
a few notes. The sweetness and comfort of the piano seem only to
exaggerate their isolation and hopelessness.
2- See notes
Suddenly a rush of sea water shoots straight under the raised crate of
the piano wetting her shoes. ADA stands, pushing FLORA onto her feet.
She is aghast to see the tide has crept in completely unnoticed.
They watch three of their boxes float out to sea. One of the hens has
escaped the crate and is bobbing up and down in the waves.
SCENE 13 DELETED
Sc 14     EXT     BEACH                         DUSK     Sc 14
There is just a pink streak left in the sky. ADA and FLORA shelter
inside their make-shift tent, a hooped petticoat secured at the edges
with stones.  Inside the tent a candle lights up their conversation.
ADA is hand signaling a story to FLORA who lies back watching, nervous
and afraid. ADA's whole self is involved in the ""telling"", her face is
alight with expression, now tender, now sad, now humorous, now soft,
while her hands and fingers are deft and precise. From outside it is
an odd shadow play."|stage direction

thinking"|speech

call him Papa.  I'm not going

25||"Sc 15     EXT     BUSH ON WAY TO BEACH          DAY     Sc 15
Through a dense bush walk a party of fourteen MAORI people and two
EUROPEAN MEN. The wetness, closeness and darkness of the bush is such
that the air seems green, like at the bottom of a deep sea. Two of the
MAORIS share one pair of shoes and all of them are clothed in a
mixture of native and European costume. Of the Europeans one is small
and has a shy manner. He has a half completed Maori tattoo across his
cheeks. The other is a similar age about 45 and wears a suit, muddy
and out of place here in the bush. He staggers, spurts forward then
slows to a stop. His hair and face are wet and his skin reflects the
green foliage. BAINES the younger man turns and slows."|stage direction
26|BAINES|"Are we stopping?... Do you want
to stop?"|speech
27||"The MAORI voices and laughter are becoming fainter. BAINES watches
torn between his concern for STEWART and the split in their party.

(Wait! We are stopping.. we're

31||"STEWART takes out a comb and drags it dazed and zombie like through
his wet hair. Inside the darkness of his pocket, he turns over and
over a small, worn edged photograph, a smudge of green light allows us
to see ADA's tumbling face. Taking it in the heel of his hand he
secretly looks at it. Just as the party return and settle he stares on
ahead possessed and determined."|stage direction

35||"Sc 16     EXT     BEACH                     MORNINGSc 16
It is early morning. The sea is calmer and the tide is again low. The
party or two EUROPEANS and fourteen MAORI MEN and WOMEN come out on to
the beach. About half the MAORI party head straight for the shoreline
where an older woman loudly organises a pipi collection. All sorts of
containers are used from flax baskets to shirts with knots in their
arms. The rest follow STEWART and BAINES over to the boxes. STEWART
automatically re-combs his hair, patting it against his forehead,
where it sticks in a raked pattern. On his head he carefully places a
formal top hat, oddly dean compared to his mud splattered suit. The
party stops short of the petticoats where a tell-tale foot reveals its
occupants."|stage direction
36|STEWART|"Miss McGrath, Alisdair Stewart.
You'll have to wake yourself.
I've got men here to carry your
things."|speech

men and women. The MAORIS stare curiously and comment on the women."|stage direction

like angels.)"|speech

boxes, I'd like to know what is
in each."|speech

46||ADA nods and looks up coldly, insulted by his slow loud speaking.|stage direction
47|STEWART|"Well that is good, yes that is
good, good."|speech
48||"STEWART smiling searches ADA's face for some sign of comprehension but
is unnerved by her lack of response. He stops smiling, and, patting
his hair walks to the closest box. Several of the MAORI party follow
behind STEWART while one of them closely and particularly mimics him."|stage direction
49|STEWART|What's in here?|speech

Pots""."|stage direction

there, crockery."|speech

you'd be small."|speech

that BAINES should suggest he might carry anything. HONE does not
carrying, he is the boss. With great dignity HONE retreats, too
injured to help. Other MAORIS come up and BAINES assigns them boxes.
ADA gets worried, the piano is being left alone. She writes on her
pad, ""THE PIANO?"" She shows STEWART."|stage direction

uncomfortable impression he is being interrupted."|stage direction

difficult journey. The bush
will tear clothes and the mud
is deep in places."|speech
92||"STEWART walks away. ADA stands beside the piano turned away from the

a fire is lit and pipis are prepared for cooking. Some of the young
men are racing naked into the sea."|stage direction

It is some hours later and the carrying party are beginning to make
their way up into the bush. ADA still stands beside her piano. FLORA
wants to follow the party. BAINES comes back along the beach, trailed
by a young Maori boy, KAHA."|stage direction
95|BAINES|"Mr. Stewart asked if I might
show you to the path. (ADA does
not move) ... May I carry
something?"|speech
96||"ADA turns to BAINES, her face angry and defiant, her eyes full of
tears. BAINES falls back, struck by her show of emotion. ADA and FLORA
walk past him toward the bush.

The party threads its way through the bush along the cliff. ADA pauses
at the cliff top to see her piano below on the sand, tiny and
desolate. Its distance and her love of it suddenly strike her. Its
music is faint and becomes loud over the next scene.

Brown feet squelch through the mud, finally followed by dainty boots

claustrophobic and exotic. One of the MAORI women sits close to ADA

Meanwhile another woman makes a very dignified attempt to wipe the
freckles from FLORA's face.

their way through on planks and logs. A fine veil of rain is falling
across the distant bush, the whole valley is shrouded in mist. STEWART
looks through the camera at the REVEREND and the photographer who are
posing as the couple, complete with tatty bouquet. STEWART notices

up out of nowhere. But so

rose for the final bars of the

came out of the sky and struck
my father so that he lit up

The sky is blue with long wisps of cloud.
The party of three break onto the long expanse of beach where the
piano still stands. It has not been without visitors. There are
footprints on the sand and some of the boards have been pulled back.
ADA passes BAINES, walking urgently towards it. Soon, ADA has removed
enough boards that she may lift the lid and play the keys. EMNES stays
back. ADA takes great delight in feeling her fingers on the keys
again. Her whole composition is altered. She is animated, joyful,
excited.
Down on the wet sand FLORA does a wild dance of her own invention
using a seaweed wig. She finishes by rolling down the beach in the
sand.
BAINES views them with suspicion, yet he is magnetically drawn to the
spectacle He has never seen women behave with so much abandon. His
attention fixes on ADA's uninhibited emotional playing, and as he
watches, he finds himself edging irresistibly closer.

The shadows are long on the sand when BAIN'ES collects the boards. ADA
and FLORA are attempting a duet. ADA notices him come towards them
with the boards, obviously intending that they should leave. Her mood
darkens, she continues playing stubbornly even though FLORA has
stopped. Abruptly she finishes. In black spirits she replaces her cape
and bonnet. BAINES is struck by this sudden change, he watches her
mesmerised as he replaces the boards.

feels him passing behind her.  He seems satisfied to watch. His
attention finally focuses on her neck as it bends further or closer to
the piano.
Again he shifts his chair, taking it round the back and to the other
side of the piano. As he moves ADA watches warily. From this position
be doesn't try to touch her, but watches, enjoying her fingers moving
on the keys and the small details of motion on her face. Twice he
closes his eyes and breathes deeply BAINES is experiencing an
unpractised sense of appreciation and lust. When his eyes are closed,
ADA glances at him with curiosity and suspicion.

face betrays her feelings. ADA seizes this opportunity to return to

run a hand noiselessly over the polished ivory keys, a gesture
betraying affection never afforded to him. BAINES gets up. He shuts
the piano lid forcing ADA to remove her hand.

The next day ADA and her piano face each other across the kitchen. A
slit of light falls across the piano highlighting it's rosey walnut
wood. ADA's expression is critical and distant.
Taking a cloth she begins to clean and polish the piano. Her finger
holds down one of the keys and we glimpse an old inscription on its
side, a small heart, and an arrow. Putting the cloth aside she sits at
the piano to begin playing.
She starts with wholehearted feeling, her eyes closed, but before long
she is surprised by a moving reflection across the piano and she
'starts', glancing over her shoulder. She stops and begins again. But
once more a reflex has her glance across her left shoulder and she
pauses in her playing. Disquieted she starts again and again she looks
away. She stops, confused, unable to go on, unable to getup, one hand
on the lid and one on the piano keys.

has spoken words of love. ADA is flushed, shocked, the two face each
other at this very moment of profound awareness of each other,
profoundly equal. With each new breath, with every moment that their
eyes remained locked together the promise of intimacy is confirmed and
reconfirmed and detailed until like sleepwalkers who do not know how
they came to wake where they did, they are standing next to each other
and beginning to kiss each other, the lips, the cheeks, the nose.
There is nothing practised about their tenderness, only their feelings

loosely slatted boards. There are sounds inside which are worrying
him. By standing on the seat he has found a spyhole where he can see
ADA and BAINES kissing, undressing
He reels back angry, but just as we might expect him to burst through,
he steps up to look again; the fatal second look, the look for
curiosity. He watches BAINES bare-chested undressing ADA, her buttons
burst, ADA laughs, BAINES touches her under her skirts - anywhere, he
takes himself under her dress pulling down her stockings. STEWART
watches, stepping down to peer lower as BAINES buries into ADA's
skirt. He does not seem to notice the dog licking his hand. Suddenly
he pulls his hand away and looks at it, wet with dog saliva, he wipes
it on the boards and continues watching as if mesmerised.

to guard against followers, when directly in front of her STEWART
steps out onto her path. ADA stops short. The look on his face is
unlike any expression she has yet seen. His eyes do not look at her,
but all about her in a way more animal than human. She lowers her eyes
and calling his bluff walks steadily past him. But STEWART takes her
arm and spinning her back, pulls her close and blind to all protest
kisses her. ADA struggles furiously. His grip falters and she steps
back staring at him, then runs off down the hill, but STEWART is on

brings his mouth to her leg and begins to kiss her knee, her thigh. A

the thought to himself, he cannot resist it. He glances at her face
still fevered and unconscious. Quietly, stealthily, he begins to undo
his belt buckle. He bends across her to gently separate her legs. As

The sea is choppy and the piano is difficult to steady in the canoe.
BAINES helps the rigging of the piano, thick rope ends coil under the
women's feet. HIRA is left on the shore with one child and two other
MAORI people.
Tears run openly down her big sad face as she sings her farewell to
BAINES."|stage direction

BAINES speaks to the MAORIS who stop paddling and together they loosen
the ropes securing the piano to the canoe.
As they maneuver the piano to the edge ADA Jocks into the water. She
puts her hand into the sea and moves it back and forth.
The piano is carefully lowered and with a heave topples over. As the
piano splashes into the sea, the loose ropes speed their way after it.
ADA watches them snake past her feet and then out of a fatal
curiosity, odd and undisciplined, she steps into a loop.
The rope tightens and grips her foot so that she is snatched into the
sea, and pulled by the piano down through the cold water.
Sc 146INT     SEA NEAR BEACH     DAY     Sc 146
Bubbles tumble from her mouth. Down she falls, on and on. her eyes are
open, her clothes twisting about her. The MAORIS diving after her
cannot reach her in these depths. ADA begins to struggle. She kicks at
the rope, but it holds tight around her boot. She kicks hard again and
then with her other foot, levers herself free from her shoe. The piano
and her shoe continue their fall while ADA floats above, suspended in
the deep water, then suddenly her body awakes and fights, struggling
upwards to the surface.

hair and arms stretched out in a gesture of surrender, her body slowly
turning on the end of the rope. The seaweed's rust coloured fronds
reach out to touch her.

THERE IS A SILENCE WHERE NO SOUND MAY BE
