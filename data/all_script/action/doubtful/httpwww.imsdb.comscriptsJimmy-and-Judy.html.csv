POV of a HOME VIDEO CAMERA shooting into the window of
teenage girl's bedroom.
The door inside opens. In walks JUDY OAKS-KELLEN (18), a
blond haired, mousy girl, wearing only a T-shirt and panties.
As she heads to the mirror we hear...
Sound of skin smacking against skin and heavy breathing.
Whoever operates the camera is definitely CHOAKIN' THE
GOPHER.
Judy combs her hair in the mirror, oblivious.
The camera operator is in a whack off frenzy as he..."|stage direction

runs laps during her gym class. Judy, again, has no idea
that she is being filmed as camera zooms in tight.
She's tired, sweating profusely, and looks completely
miserable. She stops running, exhausted, as the other kids
pass her.
Suddenly, a very Butch looking female GYM TEACHER (40) walks
over and begins BERATING Judy. The Gym Teacher's face turns
red as she spews insults inches away from Judy's face.
We can't hear what she's saying, but whatever it is, it's
cruel, harsh, and very intense. Exhausted and humiliated,
Judy holds back tears as...
Camera shuts down."|stage direction

Late summer evening. Camera Operator wipes dirt from the
lens with his shirt revealing his face for the first time as
he looks at camera. This is the first time we get even a
glimpse of JIMMY WRIGHT (21). His looks are striking, even a
bit awkward, but not at all unappealing.
He throws a mischievously evil look at the lens, then settles
his face back to normal. He spins the camera away, pointing
it at the back of his house.
Through the kitchen window, Jimmy zooms in on his mother
(JIMMY'S MOM) (40's) idyllic version of a mom in new
millennium suburban housewife clothes. She's on the phone,
preparing dinner."|stage direction

munching on mixed nuts from a crystal bowl."|stage direction

sniffs them."|stage direction

Jimmy hides hidden camera style inside his car in the high
school parking lot, bleachers in the distance. School is
letting out as he zooms in on Judy.
She's looking at the ground as she's taunted by a group of
Other Harassing Teenagers, a tear streaming down the side of
her cheek.
Suddenly, Judy is bashed in the face with a school bag. She
falls to the ground, then picks up her broken glasses as
camera zooms out to catch the Girl who hit her (Mean Girl)."|stage direction

Girl's, then he dumps a cup of soda on Judy's head as she's
crying.
Judy screams at the top of her lungs. The group runs off
laughing. Jimmy whip pans to the Mean Girl as she laughs
with her friends, then whips pans back to Judy, now on her

A scene we've seen before. Jimmy is off camera videotaping
Judy through her bedroom window. We hear him FLOGGIN' THE
DOLPHIN off screen while Judy combs her hair in the mirror.
She stops when she hears...
A Grown Man, (45), walks into the doorway of her bedroom.
This is JUDY'S DAD. He comes in and doesn't say a thing to
her. Judy doesn't acknowledge him at all and continues
combing her hair as though he's not even there.
He comes up behind her, then wraps his arms around her,
giving her a warm hug from behind. Something's not right.
The masturbation sounds STOP.
Judy's noticeably uncomfortable but doesn't resist as her
Father begins kissing her neck. His hand slowly creeps down
to her pelvic area, his other hand turning out the bedroom
light. The room goes dark.
Camera flips down, then OFF...
Then COMES BACK ON AGAIN
Once again we're looking through the camera pointing at the
window, but now it's the distorted, grainy, black and white
of ""Nite Shot"" mode. Though we see the Judy's mirror and her
dresser, she and her Father are nowhere to be found.
Whatever's going on between them, it's going on out of frame,

has the door of the closet cracked and puts the lens of the
camera through the crack.
Jimmy's Dad enters the room. He has no idea that he is being
filmed and that Jimmy is in the closet.
Jimmy's Dad walks over to the dresser, opens up the top
drawer and pulls something out. It's too dark in the room to
tell exactly what he's pulled out, but it appears to resemble
some sort of undergarment.
Jimmy's Dad begins undressing, then steps out of frame.
After a beat, he reappears. Now he's wearing nothing but a
sequined teddy. He's totally fat, hairy, and nasty looking.
He sits on the side of the bed, his back to us. Now we see
that what he grabbed out of the drawer was actually a pair of
fishnet stockings. He begins putting them on.
When he is finished putting on his panty hose, he gets up off
the bed and begins admiring his legs in a mirror. He begins
to gently stroke the sides of his legs, relishing the feel of
the hose over his hands and fingertips.
He seems to be lip syncing the words to a song and begins to
get all worked up. He shakes his hips and dances around the
room for a few seconds.
Now Jimmy's Dad goes to the dresser and pulls out a long
brunette wig from the back of his top drawer. Putting it on,
with the fishnet stockings, sequined teddy and long wig, he
has transformed himself into the world's fattest, ugliest,
hairiest, Cher look-a-like.
Someone else enters the room."|stage direction

mirror. He opens up the top drawer again and pulls out a
little makeup bag.
Jimmy's Mom re-enters, now wearing a mini leather biker's
hat, carrying a riding switch."|stage direction
570|JIMMY'S MOM|Come on slut.|speech
571||"Jimmy's Dad finishes applying his lipstick and moves over to
the bed. By the way Jimmy's parents are behaving, it's as if
they've gone through this routine a thousand times.
Jimmy's Mom drifts off screen as Jimmy's Dad gets up on all
fours. Suddenly, we hear a SMACK as Jimmy's Mom hits Jimmy's
Dad on his ass with the switch.
He lets out deep pleasured groans as she continues SMACKING
him with the whip harder and harder. He yelps, squeals, and
gyrates his hips back and forth, then starts dry humping the
air until she stops.
Jimmy's Mom comes back through and out of frame. Jimmy's Dad
pushes his belly into the bed, groaning from the pain while
he waits for her return.
She comes back, moving quickly across the screen wearing an
enormous strap on dildo.
Disappearing out of frame again, Jimmy's Dad gets himself
ready for her one more time, ass up, on all fours on the bed.
From behind, we can see her hand as she hikes her husband's
dress up his back, then we see his face and hear him grunt as
she rips his fishnets off screen.
There's a pause. Nothing seems to be happening, but Jimmy's
Dad is bracing himself for something. His face tightens up.
Off screen, Jimmy's Mom has started mounting him from behind.
Jimmy can't take it any longer. As he slowly emerges from
the closet, his Mom notices Jimmy almost immediately. She
jumps off her husband, screaming bloody murder."|stage direction

NIGHT
By the fire pit, the site where the teenage drunken of orgy
took place, the bonfire has been put out and there are dozens
of drunken/passed out teenagers lying on the ground in
sleeping bags and in tents.
Jimmy begins looking for Judy with his night vision camera.
He sees a girl lying on the ground in a sleeping bag   with her
back turned to the camera. Her hair is identical to    Judy's,
but we can't see her face. Jimmy quietly steps over    passed
out teenagers, being extremely careful not to awaken   anyone.
Jimmy accidently kicks a forty ounce beer bottle that causes
a loud clanking sound of glass on glass.
Jimmy stops in his tracks in anticipation of someone waking
up. No one does.
Jimmy continues to walk towards the GIRL WHO LOOKS LIKE JUDY.
Kneeling directly in front of her, Jimmy puts his hands on
her shoulder and pulls the girl's front region towards the
camera. The girl flips over.
It's not Judy. And luckily, the girl is so severely
intoxicated that she doesn't wake up.
Jimmy now makes his way over to a tent. He quietly unzips
the mesh entrance and extends his arm out to video tape the
inside. Turns out, the person in the tent is just another
passed out flunky loser. Jimmy quickly takes his arm out of

to make his way up.
He walks, using his Nite Shot to see, through the sea of
bodies until he gets up to the entrance...
OUTSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER
There's a cracked glass door leaning up against the woodpile
by the entrance. Jimmy steps around it, turning the lens at
the glass. He briefly catches his reflection. He looks like
hell warmed over, freshly bruised and cut from the recent
beating.
Moving forward, Jimmy makes it to the front door of Uncle
Rodney's trailer. We hear music coming from inside. Very
slowly and very carefully, Jimmy cracks the front door.
INSIDE RODNEY'S TRAILER
It's even darker inside of the trailer, but Jimmy presses
forward in spite of that fact, still using his Nite Shot to
see. A boom box sits by the bed, still on, playing music.
Jimmy is scared shitless.
In the corner of the room, in a make shift bunk, is Uncle
Rodney sleeping with his arms wrapped around a girl in a
spooning position. There's no doubt this time.
It's definitely JUDY!
They are both sound asleep and actually look very cozy lying
together. Jimmy slowly walks over towards them. Each step
is slower and slower, being extra careful not to wake them.
Once Jimmy is within arm's length of the two of them he
stops. He hesitates for a moment. He hasn't prepared
himself for this particular situation and doesn't know
exactly what to do.
He continues filming them until he finally musters the
courage to extend his non-filming arm out to tap Judy on the
face. Judy remains unconscious/sleeping as Jimmy gently taps
the side of her cheek. Jimmy slowly begins tapping harder
and harder until the tap evolves into a poke. Still nothing."|stage direction
