4||"THE EYE                                                 2
It's magnified and deeply revealed.  Flecks of green
and yellow in a field of milky blue.  Icy filaments
surround the undulating center.
The eye is brown in a tiny screen.  On the metallic
surface below, the words VOIGHT-KAMPFF are finely
etched.  There's a touch-light panel across the top
and on the side of the screen, a dial that registers
fluctuations of the iris.
The instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits
on a table between two men.  The man talking is big,
looks like an over-stuffed kid.  ""LEON"" it says on
his breast pocket.  He's dressed in a warehouseman's
uniform and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in
his lap.  Despite the obvious heat, he looks very cool.
The man facing him is lean, hollow cheeked and dressed
in gray.  Detached and efficient, he looks like a cop
or an accountant.  His name is HOLDEN and he's all
business, except for the sweat on his face.
The room is large and humid.  Rows of salvaged junk
are stacked neatly against the walls.  Two large fans
whir above their heads."|stage direction

the machine."|stage direction

so please pay attention.  Answer
quickly as you can."|speech
14||"Leon compresses his lips and nods his big head eagerly.
Holden's voice is cold, geared to intimidate and evoke
response."|stage direction
15|HOLDEN|"You're in a desert, walking along
in the sand when all of a sudden
you look down and see a..."|speech
16|LEON|What one?|speech
17||It was a timid interruption, hardly audible.|stage direction
18|HOLDEN|What?|speech
19|LEON|What desert?|speech
20|HOLDEN|"Doesn't make any difference what
desert -- it's completely
hypothetical."|speech
21|LEON|But how come I'd be there?|speech
22|HOLDEN|"Maybe you're fed up, maybe you
want to be by yourself -- who
knows.  So you look down and
see a tortoise.  It's crawling
towards you..."|speech
23|LEON|A tortoise.  What's that?|speech
24|HOLDEN|Know what a turtle is?|speech
25|LEON|Of course.|speech
26|HOLDEN|Same thing.|speech
27|LEON|I never seen a turtle.|speech
28||He sees Holden's patience is wearing thin.|stage direction
29|LEON|But I understand what you mean.|speech
30|HOLDEN|"You reach down and flip the
tortoise over on its back, Leon."|speech
31||"Keeping an eye on his subject, Holden notes the dials
in the Voight-Kampff.  One of the needles quivers
slightly."|stage direction
32|LEON|"You make these questions, Mr.
Holden, or they write 'em down
for you?"|speech
33||"Disregarding the question, Holden continues, picking
up the pace."|stage direction
34|HOLDEN|"The tortoise lays on its back,
its belly baking in the hot sun,
beating its legs trying to turn
itself over.  But it can't.  Not
without your help.  But you're
not helping."|speech
35||Leon's upper lip is quivering.|stage direction
36|LEON|Whatcha mean, I'm not helping?|speech
37|HOLDEN|"I mean you're not helping!
Why is that, Leon?"|speech
38||"Leon looks shocked, surprised.  But the needles in
the computer barely move.  Holden goes for the inside
of his coat.  But big Leon is faster.  His LASER BURNS
a hole the size of a nickel through Holden's stomach.
Unlike a bullet, a laser causes no impact.  It goes
through Holden's spine and comes out his back, clean
as a whistle.  Like a rag doll he falls back off the
bench from the waist up.  By the time he hits the
floor, big slow Leon is already walking away.  But he
stops, turns and with a little smile of satisfaction,
FIRES at the machine on the table.
There's a flash and a puff of smoke.  The Voight-Kampff
is hit dead center, crippled but not destroyed; as
Leon walks out of the room, one of its lights begins
to blink, faint but steady."|stage direction

insulated Pullman of contoured seats and low-keyed
lighting, coloured to soothe,and empty, except for
the passenger half way down.
His eyes closed, head rested against the glass.  Ten
years ago, DECKARD might have been an athlete, a
track man or a welter-weight.  The body looks it, but
the face has seen some time -- not all of it good."|stage direction

drops it next to three empty beer bottles and a
sandwich wrapper, adjusts his position and winds up
staring at his reflection in the window.  Runs a
hand over his face, it could use a shave.  He leans
closer and peers through the glass.
Out there in the black a sign flashes past:  SAN

things off."|stage direction

no hope of improvement.  Not bad
if you're a lizard.  But two hours
earlier I was drinking Acquavit

Alaska.  That's a tough change to
make.  It was so good, I didn't
want to leave, so I left a day
early."|speech
54||"A little detached, Deckard taps another sensor on the
panel, lights up a cigarette and watches as his mes-
sages flash across the viewer stating date, time and

case and police ID pinned to his coat."|stage direction

The Tyrell Corporation's new pride

the Voight-Kampff test when one
nailed him."|speech

through."|stage direction
75|DECKARD (V.O.)|"The Nexus-6 must be fast because
Holden was as quick as they come.

his face, the broken capillaries in his nose say
brawler, spoiler, drinker, but the diplomas on the
wall say something else.  Bryant's kneeled at his safe
trying to open it.  Deckard it sitting on the edge of
the desk reading the print-out."|stage direction

whiskey."|stage direction

for him ever since."|speech

just poured for him."|stage direction
82|DECKARD|Six, huh?|speech
83|BRYANT|"Five.  Three nights ago one of
them managed to break into the
Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two
guards and got as far as the
Genetic Sector before he got
fried going through an electro-
field."|speech
84|DECKARD|What was he after?|speech
85|BRYANT|"There wasn't much left of him,
so we can't be sure.  But bio-
chemical data and morphology records
of the Nexus-6 were reported
missing.  Going on the possibility
they might try to infiltrate we
send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff
tests on the new employees.  Guess
he found himself one."|speech
86||A grim pause.|stage direction
87|DECKARD|You got a machine on it yet?|speech
88|BRYANT|"We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that
picked up Holden's alarm.  Its
guess is that all five are in
the city."|speech

90||Bryant's back at the safe locking up his bottle.|stage direction
91|BRYANT|"The Tyrell Corporation has a
demo model.  Check it out on the
Voight-Kampff.  There's a chance
the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability
to detect.  If that's the case,
everybody's up shit creek."|speech

copies down a number and hands it over."|stage direction

99||Deckard stands and holds up his drink.|stage direction
100|DECKARD|Thanks.|speech
101||"Like a sick boy looking out of the window, Bryant
watches Deckard down the whiskey.  Deckard puts down
the glass and turns to leave."|stage direction
102|DECKARD (V.O.)|"The big incentive to emigrate was
still free labor.  If the public
found out that their door-prizes
might kill them, they might not be
so hot to go up there.  This was
one of the worst one's we had and
Bryant was worried.  He wanted to
tell me to be discrete or something.
But I didn't give him a chance."|speech

downpour."|stage direction

106||"A heavy metal maze of cubicles and perilous iron
balconies, peopled with rejects from the surface world;
Mato Grosso Indians in white man's clothes and other
lower echelon welfare recipients.  Drop city is crowded,
cramped and darkly alive.
Deckard steps out of an elevator and moves through the
crowd.  A cloud of steam drifts up through  a grating
as two old men, clad in towels descend a flight of
stairs under a neon sign that says bath house.
A musty subterranean wind ripples Deckard's clothes as
he turns into an alcove.  He stops in front of a door
that says, MANAGER and pushes the buzzer.  It's opened
by an emphysema victim with an oxygen tank lashed to
his hip.  Deckard flashes his ID and speaks some words
which are inaudible due to the TUBA MUSIC down the hall.
The man grabs a key from his wall, hands it over and
shuts the door."|stage direction

108||"The companion ways below deck of a big ship are no
more bewildering than the ups and downs and ins and
outs of this establishment.  But Deckard finds the door
he's looking for.  He pauses a moment, listens, then
knocks.  He inserts the key and with a hand on his gun
opens it."|stage direction

110||"An empty room.  A cot and not much else.  He steps in
and stands quiet as a hunter sensing the signs.  For a
place surrounded by greasy hovels it is surprisingly
clean.  Spartan in fact.  The towel by the spotless
basin is perfectly folded.
Deckard runs two fingers over a shelf.  No dust.  He
looks in the waste basket.  Wadded up candy wrappers.
The bed by the window is neatly made.  Deckard looks
under it, then runs his hands along both sides of the
mattress.
The closet.  There's one suit in it.  He pats it down.
Nothing. A show box on the floor.  He stoops, takes
out what looks like a pen from his pocket and care-
fully traces it over the box.  Assured of its harm-
lessness, he lifts off the lid.
It contains a little stack of photos bound with a
rubber band.  Deckard removes them, goes to the lamp
by the balcony window and turns it on.
A touching collection of family snapshots.  The kind of
anonymous stuff sold by the bunch in dusty junk shops.
The family dog.  Junior on the pony squinting in the
sun.  Uncle Ben clowning with the kids.  The faded
polaroid of Christmas morning.  Simple pictures of
simple folks celebrating the family bond.  A curious
collection for the likes of Leon and Deckard studies
them with interest."|stage direction

in the doorway, peddling candy and artificial flowers
looking like he'd never been touched by the light of
day.
Leon is standing behind him, staring up at his room,
watching Deckard at the window.  He's still wearing
his coveralls, but he looks different.  His face is
more intent, smarter and angry."|stage direction

small tables.  Old slant-eyed enders humped over their
fuming bowls jabbering and slurping.
The only voice coming out clear is from the big three-
D TV on the back wall.  As the mellow-mouthed TV
announcer delivers the message, a Latin-looking beauty
in a well-fitted maids uniform does a twirl, flashes
a beguiling smile and glides OUT OF FRAME."|stage direction

The woman is pretty, a touch of gray in her hair, kind

right out of ""Father Knows Best.""
The man also resembles a tradition: the gym instructor,
short cropped hair with the body of a drill sergeant,
but the eyes are grey and chilling.  ROY BATTY is a
presence of force with a lazy, but acute sense of what
goes on around him.
Leon has just come through the door behind them.  Try-
ing not to be the bull in a china shop, he approaches
their table and kneels .  Batty doesn't bother to look
at him, which amplifies the note of sarcasm in his
quiet voice."|stage direction

eyes are shrewd and Chinese, but the rest of him

a moment his lips peal back into a sour, belligerent
smile."|stage direction

honey has a couple of defective cones."|speech

client.
SEBASTIAN'S face is almost young, but something has
gone too far, too fast.  Premature old age has made
his bones brittle and his co-ordination slow.  The

morgue.  The glass-doored compartments in the walls
look like crypts.  Some of them small as post office
boxes.  From one of the Chew removes a vacuum, packed
box.  Carefully separating the seal, he reaches into
the purple jell and with a pair of tweezers extracts
an eye.
Through the jeweler's glass, which he has not bothered
to remove, Chew holds the eye up to the light and
studies it a moment.  His other hand searches through
his pockets."|stage direction
148|CHEW|You got a pocket-charger, boy?|speech

device from a row of such things in his breast pocket

the pencil and the pupil moves.  Suddenly its staring
back at them."|stage direction

Pay the little guy last.  You should
charge twice as much.  It'll make
him feel better."|speech

jolt that causes him to yelp.
PRIS is sprawled on the seat next to him, and wakes up
with a yelp of her own.  They stare at one another for
a startled instant, and she jumps out and starts walk-

But she's forgotten her little beat-up overnight case.

The front of the Opera House is open only to foot traf-
fic these days.  A bizarre place on a Friday night,
hawkers and whores, the rabble, the poor and the cur-
ious mill around the randy-built platforms and brightly
lit stands.   Zhora, in just a raincoat, is not out of
place in this flea market atmosphere.  Trying not to
run, she slices through the mob as quickly as she can.
Deckard is not far behind, dodging and side-stepping,
trying to move against the tide of people scurrying for
shelter.
She comes to an intersection and turns out of the mall
onto a less crowded street.  She glances over her
shoulder as she breaks into a run and runs right into
a couple of pedestrians.  All three go down.
Deckard comes out of the crowd in time to spot her get-
ting to her feet.  She sees him and runs.  The two ped-
estrians are in his line of fire.  He runs past them
and drops to one knee, leveling his laser."|stage direction

674||"She doesn't.  The beam flashes through the air, but
she's already around the corner.
With his bottom lip between his teeth, it hurts to move
so fast, Deckard jack-legs it into the street and jumps
in front of the first car coming.  It screeches to a
stop.  Deckard scrambles for the door, but the guy be-
hind the wheel has other ideas.  He peels out fast.
The next car slows down and swerves trying not to hit
him.  Deckard goes for the door and before the old ma-
tron inside can lock it, Deckard's yanked it open and
jumps in.  She screams as he pushes her into the pas-
senger seat and jams the car into a wrenching about
face.  The lady squeals like a pig as the momentum
plasters her against the door.
Deckard slams it around the corner and guns it down the
street.  It's long and it's empty and it's going by fast.
Nothing the old lady cares to see -- she's got her hands
over her eyes, whimpering, hoping she'll faint before
she dies.
Deckard takes the next left so hard he almost lays it
over.  As the car bounces off the curb he floors it.
Zhora's a hundred yards ahead, halfway down the street,
trying to make it back into the crowded mall.  She's
running fast, but the car is faster.
As he passes her, Deckard hits the brakes and skids
broadside seventy feet.  The door flies open and he
rolls out FIRING.
Zhora's ducking it with no where to go, except...
The showcase window on her left EXPLODES as she crashes
through.
It's a corner shop joined to a series of stores, front-
ing the mall.  Deckard runs to the opening she's made
and pours FIRE through the tunnel of her jagged wake as
Zhora breaks through one window after another, getting
sliced, getting shot, trying to get away from Deckard's
laser.  But she doesn't.
His last shot burns a hole through the base of her
skull.  It kills her but doesn't stop her.  Her speed
takes what's left of her through the last two windows
and into the street where she runs into a parked car
with such force that she embeds herself in the side of
it.
Hunched over, breathing hard, Deckard comes slowly for-
ward.  The crowd starting to gather.  There's something
for everybody and they're coming from all directions.
Deckard moves through them, edging to have a look.
It's not a good thing to see.  It looks like Salome
and the car tries to eat each other.  A bloody feast
of metal and flesh.

The man is hanging off the floor, his arms locked into

chest... but he was already dead.
Deckard stares at the corpse.  It's Mr. Deetchum, the
old watchman.  That RUSTLING SOUND are rats who were
feeding on him, scampering for safer places, Deckard
gets to his feet.
The stairway rectangles ten stories up.  As his foot
touches the first step, a raw, terrified SCREAM shatters
the air.  It came from below.  It's the cry of a young
girl -- it GROWS TO A PIERCING SHRIEK AND ABRUPTLY

tarnished, the equipment atrophied from lack of use.
The heavier barbells have sunk into the floor.  Two
weight-reducing machines are flapping and grinding away
like idiots.  Deckard's eyes stop on the woman.
She dangles a few feet off the floor, hung by the
shoulders through rings suspended from the ceiling.
Her head is slung forward, her body limp and slightly
swaying.
Deckard pushes open one of the doors until it touches
the wall.  Slowly, he advances toward the hanging figure,
keeping an eye on the mirror to cover surprises from the
door.  He's not breathing hard.  His heart isn't pound-
ing.  Deckard's in his element.
Close enough to look up into her face, he stops.  It
isn't grisly death that causes the reaction in his
eyes.  It's the innocence of her angel face.
It's not something he has time to consider.  In the
mirror behind him, he sees the door starting to open.
Deckard spins.  He shouldn't have.  Pris' legs snap up,
crack the laser out of his hand and clamp around his
neck.
Slowly, the door swings closed, but Deckard doesn't
notice.  His carotid artery is no longer sending blood
to the brain.  He jerks up his foot and reaches down.
As his fingers close around the ankle laser, Pris'
fingers close around his wrist.  Deckard's hand opens
like a flower.  The laser drops to the floor as his
eyes roll back into his head."|stage direction

into his back.  He's propelled fifteen feet across the
room, slams into a machine and falls to the floor.
Pris flies off the rings and comes at him.
Deckard reaches out to pull himself up, but she's al-
ready there.  Not too hard and just in the right place,
she kicks him in the stomach.  He goes back to the
floor, gagging for air.  Oh-so-precisely she reaches
out with a long index finger and flips the switch on
the machine.
It's a flab eliminator with a vibrator belt.  Normally
an innocuous piece of equipment, but the motor housing
on this one is missing.  Lots of GRINDING METAL.  A
bad place for flesh and bone.
But that's where Deckard's hand is going.  An eight-
year-old against a full-down man.  In two more seconds
his hand will be ground round.  Deckard tries to pull
his hand loose.  It won't come.  He yanks hard, but
it's welded in hers.
His face is twisted and strained as he raises a leg,
wedges his foot against her chest and pushes with all
his might.  The hold breaks.  They topple back.  Deckard
hits the floor gulping to catch his breath.  Pris is up
and coming for him again.  She hovers over him.  Deckard
rolls out of the way as she comes down like a pile
driver.
Reflexively Deckard raises his arm to protect himself.
Pris just smiles, takes hold of his foot and drags him
across the floor.  She doesn't like to leave a piece of
work unfinished.  They're going back to the machine.
He goes by a weight-stand of dumbbells and grabs hold.
It doesn't stop him.  He's sliding over the floor like
it was ice, weight stand in tow.
Pris gets to the machine, yanks his foot up and forces
it toward the opening.  Deckard sits up, a five-pound
dumbbell in his hand, and clobbers her in the back.  It
knocks her off balance, but she doesn't let go of his
foot.  She hooks out with a fist but misses.  He gets
her with a roundhouse in the face.
She goes to the floor and Deckard's up, the dumbbell
over his head, coming down with it.  Fighting for her
life now, Pris drives a foot into his chest.  It lifts
him off the floor.  He flies back across the gym and
lands in a heap.
No more games.  Pris is furious and moving fast.  She
rips a steel bar out of the wall and, holding it over-
head, charges him like a samurai.  As she comes down
for the kill, she freezes.
Deckard landed near the laser.  He crawls towards it.
As in a nightmare, it takes forever.  But he gets there.
He reaches out and grabs the laser, rolls over and
takes careful aim.  She charges towards him, screaming
her rage.  He FIRES as she comes.
The shot amputates her left arm at the shoulder, but
her hand doesn't let go of the bar.  It dangles crazily
in front of her as she charges forward.
He PUTS THE NEXT ONE through her neck.  Pris hiccups a
rope of blood as she flies through the air and crashes
next to Deckard.  Dead.
He lies next to her, chest heaving.  Slowly he rolls
over and gets to his hands and knees.  Panting, he stag-
gers to his feet and stands over her, swaying slightly.
The sound that escapes his throat is raspy and dry.  It
might not sound like a war cry, but it is."|stage direction

Footprints coming and going from a door halfway down the

Deckard FIRES three quick shots through the door.  If
somebody were on the other side of it, they aren't now.
He kicks the door open and dives through head first
and hits the floor in a roll, POURING FIRE into the
far corners of the room but the room is empty.  There's
a kitchen bar, a closet and a bedroom door, both
closed.  Deckard's breathing is the only sound.  No
response from either door.
Maybe it was a sound, maybe intuition, but suddenly
Deckard twists around and FIRES several shots into the
closet.  The smouldering door slowly creaks open.
Mary is huddled in the rear of the closet.  Her hand
out like somebody about to catch a ball but afraid of
it.  In her other hand she clutches a button-eyed
monkey.  Her face is bewildered, frozen in fear, her
body riddled with holes.  No recognition gap here.
Deckard SHOOTS her through the neck to make sure.  Mary
falls to the floor, like a puppet with her strings cut.
Deckard backs away from the pathetic figure in the
closet and sits on the sofa, unable to take his eyes
off her.
Deckard lays the laser down next to him, holds out his
hand and looks at it.  It's steady.  He drops it in
his lap, closes his eyes and leans back.
A TAPPING from the ceiling.  Deckard looks up.
A KNOCK -- with the proverbial DOUBLE RAP at the end.
A pause.  Deckard jumps out of the way as the ceiling
gives in.  Chucks on concrete and plaster hit the

over, but even before his eyes see the pavement, he
knows.  He spins...
Deckard FIRES again.  This one goes home.  Batty falls
like he was poleaxed, hits the floor dead weight.
Deckard starts to tremble.  His arms go limp as his
head tilts back and he closes his eyes.  He can breathe
again.
On the floor, Batty's hand is crawling toward Deckard's
ankle.
With the unsuspected abruptness of a man slipping on a
banana peel, Deckard comes down.  Face knotted in hor-
ror, he EMPTIES THE LASER in Batty's body -- but the
hand holds on.  With a screech of frustration he drops
the laser and like an animal claws at Batty's dead
fingers -- but the fingers are welded shut.
Deckard starts to crawl, pulling Batty behind him.  He
struggled through the door and stumbles to his feet."|stage direction

body to the edge of the landing.  He pauses for breath,
then lays back, wedging his feet against Batty's shoul-
ders and pushes.  Inch by inch the body goes over the
edge.  Then all at once it drops.  But the hand holds
and the weight of the body takes Deckard with it.  As
Deckard slides over the edge, he grabs hold of the
railing.
Deckard's hanging three hundred feet over the basement
floor, supporting himself and Batty's corpse -- almost
four hundred pounds of stress on his fingers.
With his free foot he chops away at Batty's hand, try-
ing to break it loose.  But it's not working.  Deckard's
fingers are starting to slip.
His face is a mask of agony as he wedges his heel over
Batty's thumb.  With the help of gravity and everything
he's got in his right leg to push with, he pushes.  The
thumb breaks loose.  Batty falls.
The SOUND OF HIS BODY HITTING BELOW sounds good, but
Deckard doesn't notice.  He's in an awkward position.
He must reverse the way he's facing to pull himself up.
He lets go with his right hand and crosses it over the
left.  Then turns the left around so he's got an over-
hand grip.
Like a man doing his last pull-up... the one that can't
be done, Deckard pulls himself up, throws a foot over
the edge and grapples and heaves and wiggled himself
onto the cold solid steel of the stairwell landing.
And lies there, body jerking spasmodically, slowly
clenching and unclenching his cramped hand, but it's
his burning cheek against the cool metal he's most aware
of.
Dizzy, hot, lungs on fire, he stands -- and putting one
foot in front of the other, Deckard descends the stairs."|stage direction

is glad to see it.
For a moment he tilts his head back and takes some
breath, then walks across the courtyard towards the

fall.

Rachael stops and faces him.  Her lips are parted, her
