Written by
Stephen Chbosky
Final Draft
FADE IN:
1   EXT. TUNNEL - NIGHT                                             1
The titles begin over black. We hear the sound of an old
typewriter. Someone reaching out to us. The bell dings,
announcing the end of a line, and we see our title...
THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER
Music begins, picture fades up, and we are in the city.
Downtown Pittsburgh. Looking out of the back window like a
child in the back of a station wagon.
We see lights on buildings and everything that makes us
wonder. We see the bridge. And the river below. And then
we enter...
The Tunnel.
We keep moving backwards, watching the lights. Golden,
alive, and hypnotic. The music carries us as we float out of
the tunnel. Onto another bridge. And over the highway.
We move into the night sky, back through the trees, through a
window, and into...
2   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                  2
It is a neat and tidy little room. Few posters or books.
CHARLIE is 15. He is innocent, hopeful, awkward, and likable
to everyone but his classmates. He sits at his desk, writing
a letter in pencil as he tapes the title song through the
radio on his cassette boom box."|unknown
1|CHARLIE (V.O.)|"Dear Friend, I am writing to you because
she said you listen and understand and
didn't try to sleep with that person at
that party even though you could have.
Please don't try to figure out who she is
because then you might figure out who I
am, and I don't want you to do that. I
just need to know that people like you
exist. Like if you met me, you wouldn't
think I was the weird kid who spent time
in the hospital. And I wouldn't make you
nervous."|speech
2||"3   INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                            3
Charlie anxiously walks through the hallway of his suburban
split level house.
2.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
I hope it's okay for me to think that.
You see, I haven't really talked to
anyone outside of my family all summer.
Charlie moves to the living room where dad watches a football
game. Mom reads a page turner and sips her white wine.
Charlie waits for them to notice him. And waits. And waits.
4   INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      4
Charlie sits at his desk, continuing his letter in pencil.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
But tomorrow is my first day of high
school ever, and I really need to turn
things around this year.
(hopeful)
So, I have a plan.
5   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LAST DAY                      5
We see it in Charlie's mind. Slow motion and wondrous. The
kids clear out their lockers by throwing their old papers in
the air like a New York confetti parade.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
As I enter the school for the first time,
I will visualize what it will be like on
the last day of my senior year.
Charlie walks down the hall.   Triumphant.   Confident.   Happy.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Unfortunately, I counted, and that's...
SMASH CUT TO:
6   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - FIRST DAY                     6
Reality. The bell rings, and we see the chaotic maze from
Charlie's POV. A SENIOR BULLY leads the ritual, making
dozens of freshmen hop down the hall.
SENIOR BULLY
Hop, freshman toads. Hop!    Move it, boys!
As seniors grab more victims, Charlie moves to the wall.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
... 1,385 days from now.
VARSITY FOOTBALL PLAYERS pass, wearing their letter jackets.
3.
LINEBACKER
Man, you got big.
NOSE TACKLE
Worked out all summer.   Rock hard, dude.
At the front of the pack is BRAD HAYS (17), the quarterback.
He's good looking, charismatic, and friendly. The big man on
campus. Nice guy, too.
BRAD HAYS
Would you guys get a room?
They laugh. Charlie turns to the trophy case to avoid them.
Trying to make himself as small as possible.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
(trying to be optimistic)
Just 1,385 days.
7   INT. MILL GROVE HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LUNCH                  7
Charlie moves down the lunch line with his sister. CANDACE
KELMECKIS is 17 and a beautiful type A, straight A priss.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
In the meantime, I'd hoped that my sister
Candace and her boyfriend Derek would
have let me eat lunch with their earth
club.
CANDACE
Seniors only.
(barks to Derek)
What are you doing with a plastic spork?
Candace turns to her boyfriend, DEREK, 17. Derek is such a
pussy, the most masculine thing about him is his pony-tail.
DEREK
I don't want to bring back silverware--
CANDACE
Derek, you're Earth Club Treasurer.
Derek takes the silverware like a beaten dog. Charlie
watches them move into the intimidating cafeteria.
8   INT. CAFETERIA - LATER                                           8
Charlie sits in the corner alone, observing everyone having a
great time with their friends. He sees a pretty girl with
blonde hair having the best first day. This is SUSAN, 14.
4.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
When my sister said no, I thought maybe
my old friend Susan would want to have
lunch with me.
Charlie catches her eye and waves, but she looks away.
CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
In middle school, Susan was very fun to
be around, but now she doesn't like to
say hi to me anymore.
Charlie turns his attention to the quarterback, Brad Hays."|unknown
3||"And then there's Brad Hays, who's the
quarterback of our team. Before my
brother went to play football for Penn
State, he and Brad played together. So,
I thought maybe he'd say hi to me. But
Brad's a senior, and I'm me, so... who am
I kidding?
Brad catches Charlie staring at him.   Awkward.
9   INT. SHOP CLASS - DAY                                           9
Charlie sits by himself, watching the freshmen boys laugh as
a senior paints a goatee on his face with a grease pencil.
CHARLIE (V.O.)
On the bright side, one senior decided to
make fun of the teacher instead of the
freshmen. He even drew on Mr. Callahan's
legendary goatee with a grease pencil.
Meet PATRICK (18), full of confidence, mischief, and so over
high school. He is the class clown, performing a perfect
imitation of the teacher, Mr. Callahan.
PATRICK
Boys, the prick punch is not a toy. I
learned that in 'Nam back in '68.
""Callahan,"" the sergeant said, ""put down
that prick punch and go kill some gooks.""
The laughter suddenly dies as the real MR. CALLAHAN (57)
walks up behind the oblivious Patrick.
PATRICK (CONT'D)
But you know what happened? That prick
punch killed my best friend in a Saigon
whorehouse.

the long walk back to his seat."|stage direction
9|CHARLIE (V.O.)|"I felt really bad for Patrick. He wasn't

anything. He was just trying to make us
freshmen feel better."|speech

SMART ASS FRESHMAN
(whispers)
Nice Trapper Keeper, faggot.
The kids around him laugh. Charlie's ears turn red. At the
blackboard, the teacher writes his name... Mr. Anderson. But
you can call him BILL (27). Bill is an idealist.
BILL
Shhh. I'm Mr. Anderson. And thanks to
Teach for America, I'm going to be your
teacher for freshman English. This
semester, we're going to be learning
Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.
Genius book. Now, who wants to get out
of the first pop quiz?
All hands go up.   Except Charlie's.   Bill paces the rows.
BILL (CONT'D)
I'm shocked. Alright. You can skip the
quiz if you tell me which author invented
the paperback book. Anyone?
As kids think, Bill confiscates contraband, removes hats.
BILL (CONT'D)
He's British. He also invented the
serial. In fact, at the end of chapter 3
of his first novel, he had a man hanging
off a cliff by his fingernails. Hence,
the term cliffhanger. Anybody?
FRESHMAN GIRL
Shakespeare.
BILL
That's a great guess, but no, Shakespeare
didn't write novels. Anybody else?
(off their silence)
The author was...
Bill is about to give the answer when he notices Charlie has
already written... Charles Dickens.
BILL (CONT'D)
... Charles Dickens. However, if you and
I had gone to a play in Shakespeare's
time, it would have cost 4 pennies. Can
you imagine that? We would have put
those pennies in a metal box, which the
ushers would lock in the office. And
that's where we get the term... anyone?

Love it.
CHARLIE
Then, maybe you know my broth--
PATRICK
Hey, Sam.
Charlie looks up. Standing there is the prettiest girl he's

more disgusting?

Yes, they call it the men's room.

I, uh, I just didn't think you wanted
that.
SAM
Well, what did you want?
CHARLIE
I just want you to be happy.
SAM
Don't you get it, Charlie? I can't feel
that. It's really sweet and everything,
but you can't just sit there and put
everybody's lives ahead of yours and
think that counts as love. I don't want
to be somebody's crush. I want people to
like the real me.
CHARLIE
I know who you are, Sam.
Sam waits.    And Charlie finally speaks from the heart.
CHARLIE (CONT'D)
I know I'm quiet, and I know I should
speak more, but if you knew the things
that were in my head most of the time,
you'd know what it really meant. How
much we are alike. And how we've been
through the same things. And you're not
small. You're beautiful.
He can't contain himself anymore. He moves to her and kisses
her. They stand. Move to the bed. Kissing. Charlie's
heart pounds. They sit on the bed. Still kissing.
We see her fingertips. Her hand on Charlie's knee. When she
touches him, Charlie pulls away from her. Shocked. Like
he's seen a ghost. It hits Charlie like freezing water.
SAM
What's wrong, Charlie?
CHARLIE
Oh, ah... nothing.

I'm so sorry."|unknown
1043||"For a second, we see the emotion his father hides behind the

son and kisses his forehead."|location

The best days were those when I could
have visitors. My brother and sister
always came for those until Chris had to
go to training camp. He's going to be
first string this year. And my sister
told me she met a nice guy at her summer
job.

1049||Charlie nods and leaves the hospital with his mother.|location
1050||"CHARLIE (V.O.)
My doctor said we can't choose where we
can come from, but we can choose where we
go from there. I know it's not all the
answers, but it was enough to start
putting these pieces together."|unknown

How do you think the Penguins are going
to do this year, dad?
FATHER
God damn Penguins. I think they're
allergic to God damn defense.
CHARLIE
What do the players call a puck again?
FATHER
A biscuit.
CANDACE
Are you sure it's not a ""God damn
biscuit?""
FATHER
You're cruisin' for a bruisin'."|unknown

Can Charlie come out and play?"|unknown

That first night, I had grilled stickies.
It was so good. You have to visit in the
Fall. We'll have some. Okay?

CHARLIE
Definitely.
PATRICK
Sorry, Sam. Charlie has a breakdown

Well, can I tell you something? I've
been away for two months. It's another
world. And it gets better.

And my roommate Katie has the best taste
in music."|unknown

Patrick drives. Charlie in the middle. Sam the passenger."|location
1072||"CHARLIE (V.O.)
I don't know if I will have the time to
write any more letters because I might be
too busy trying to participate. So, if
this does end up being the last letter, I
just want you to know that I was in a bad
place before I started high school. And
you helped me.

The music blaring. The wind making their hair dance."|location
1074||"CHARLIE (V.O.)
Even if you didn't know what I was
talking about. Or know someone who's
gone through it. It made me not feel
alone."|unknown

1077||"Charlie gets into the back of the truck. He sits down,
looking back at the highway. Watching everywhere he's been."|location
1078||"CHARLIE (V.O.)
Because I know there are people who say
all of these things don't happen. And
there are people who forget what it's
like to be 16 when they turn 17."|unknown

they're driving. The white tiles of the tunnel whiz by at
blinding speed. A perfect night. A perfect drive. Flying."|location

I know these will all be stories someday.
And our pictures will become old
photographs. And we'll all become
somebody's mom or dad. But right now,
these moments are not stories."|unknown

smiling at him from the front seat."|location

This is happening. I am here. And I am
looking at her. And she is so beautiful."|unknown

ahead to everything in front of them. Charlie begins to
stand in the back of the truck. Ready to leave the tunnel."|location
1086||"CHARLIE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I can see it. This one moment when you
know you're not a sad story. You are
alive. And as you stand up and see the
lights on buildings and everything that
makes you wonder. And you are listening
to that song on that drive with the
people you love most in this world."|unknown
1087||"Charlie stands in the back of the truck.   The wind on his
face. He is free."|location
