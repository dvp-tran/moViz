2|unknown|"An attractive FEMALE SCIENTIST in a gore-spattered lab
coat moves fearfully along a wall, passing benches strewn
with broken lab equipment. Her ample bosom heaves as she
PANTS nervously, mascara-rimmed eyes darting to and fro.
Glass SMASHES on the floor nearby and MELODRAMATIC MUSIC
swells. The woman backs into a shadow, not noticing a
pair of dead eyes catching the moonlight behind her.
The music climbs to a frenzy as something GROANS horribly
into the woman's ear. She spins around on her stiletto
heels as a rotted face looms out of the darkness,
drooling through broken teeth, and lunges at her neck."|speech

watching TV. He has large piercing eyes and a messy shock
of hair. The movie scene we just witnessed continues off-
screen with the sound of bloodcurdling SCREAMS.
Behind him sitting upon a sofa is GRANDMA BABCOCK, a
plump old lady squinting through thick glasses."|speech

Grandma."|speech

doing that for?"|speech
10|NORMAN|"Because he's a zombie. That's what
they do."|speech
11|GRANDMA BABCOCK|"Well he's going to ruin his
dinner. I'm sure if they just
bothered to sit down and talk it
through it'd be a different story.
Norman CHUCKLES, as if the idea is absurd, then winces as
he hears his father shout from the kitchen.

18|GRANDMA BABCOCK|"Norman's mother, SANDRA BABCOCK, is emptying the
dishwasher. She is in her late thirties, and wears `mom'
clothes that do no favors for her figure. His father,
PERRY BABCOCK, is older, with a neatly-trimmed beard
trying hard to delineate chin from neck. He stands on a
chair, decked out in tool belt and safety goggles, even
though he's only changing a light bulb in a ceiling
fixture.
Sandra smiles at her son as he makes his way silently to
an overstuffed trash can as tall as he is."|speech
19|SANDRA BABCOCK|Hi. Whatcha watching in there?|speech
20|NORMAN|Sex and violence.|speech

Perry glares over as Norman wrestles with the garbage."|speech

age and pitch a tent in the yard,
or have a healthy interest in
carpentry?"|speech

were too busy shoplifting and
joyriding?"|speech

CHATTING inanely on her cell phone, Norman's older sister
COURTNEY is fifteen years-old and is the bleached-blonde
cheerleader archetype of every schoolboy's sordid dreams."|speech
28|COURTNEY|"Oh yeah, he's r-i-double p-e-d.
Like, a seven pack at least."|speech
29|(TO NORMAN)|"Ew! Watch it!
She pushes her brother out of the way as he drags the
garbage outside."|speech
30|SANDRA BABCOCK|Courtney, be nice.|speech
31|COURTNEY|"Yeah, she totally doesn't deserve
him. I mean, she's nice and I
really like her, but she's a
complete loser. Yeah, I know.
Courtney slumps into a chair at the table, twisting a
strand of gum out of her mouth with a finger.
Norman returns inside and shuts the door, pausing a
moment as if thinking something over."|speech
32|NORMAN|"Dad? Grandma says, ""Can you turn
up the heating?"" Her feet are
cold.
The bubble Courtney is blowing POPS against her face,
Perry rolls his eyes and GROANS, and Sandra pales."|speech
33|SANDRA BABCOCK|Now, Perry...|speech
34|PERRY BABCOCK|"How many times do we have to go
through this, Son? Your
grandmother is dead!"|speech
35|NORMAN|I know!|speech

Norman levels her a look that says ""you asked for this""."|speech
42|NORMAN|"She said it's not very ladylike to
hide photos of the High School
quarterback with his shirt off in
your underwear drawer.
Sandra and Perry raise their eyebrows."|speech
43|COURTNEY|"I knew it! You've been sneaking
around in my personal stuff!"|speech
44|NORMAN|No I haven't! Grandma told me!|speech
45|COURTNEY|"You are the worst!
Courtney, brimming with outrage, storms out of the
kitchen, her ponytail wagging furiously behind her.
Sandra kneels down beside Norman with a wearily
sympathetic smile."|speech
46|SANDRA BABCOCK|"Norman, I know you and Grandma
were very close, but we all have
to move on. Grandma's in a better
place now."|speech
47|NORMAN|"No she's not, she's in the living
room.
Perry throws his arms in the air, swaying on the chair."|speech

people talk! They do!
SANDRA BABCOCK (O.S.)
He's just sensitive, Perry.
PERRY BABCOCK (O.S.)
Oh please, ""sensitive"" is writing
poetry and being lousy at team
sports... not this! I won't have
him turn out like that uncle of
yours! If that crazy old tramp has
been around here putting ideas in
Norman's head...
SANDRA BABCOCK (O.S.)
Perry, no one's had anything to do
with Uncle Prenderghast in years!
I bet he doesn't even know what
Norman looks like!
Norman quietly closes the door, and the room goes black.

hand of MR PRENDERGHAST. He stands over a dusty desk
scattered with pictures of Norman, Sandra and older
family members. He is in a dark study; a wall-to-wall
trove of curious miscellanea and dumpster-dived junk."|speech
61|MR PRENDERGHAST|"Not much time, not much time...
He pulls an old leather-bound book out from the mess, and
traces a finger over a woodcut illustration on its cover;
an ethereal woman lying beneath a cluster of stars.
Wincing with pain, the man drops the book and clutches at
his chest, COUGHING and GASPING horribly.
CAMERA PANS to a wall covered in countless photographs,
newspaper clippings and scrawled occult markings. It is a
shrine of sorts; a madman's recondite genealogy project,
and at its center is a photograph of Norman, posing with
his family on vacation.
ZOOM IN to the photograph, hurtling past the Babcocks and
through dense trees further and further into a dark

turns to look at the sofa in the living room. He waves
happily, and Grandma smiles back.
Courtney passes him as she comes down the stairs in the

quaint colonial buildings are mostly in disrepair, their
picket fences rotten or daubed in graffiti.

as he shouts amiable greetings to people who simply
aren't there."|speech

goin'? Not much. I'm kind of late
for school. I need to go. Hi, nice
to see you guys. Good morning.
Sorry I gotta run. Excuse me.
Pardon me. See ya.
At one street corner, Norman bends over a gutter. He is
watched curiously by a man retrieving his morning paper
across the other side of the street.
MAN'S POV - Norman crouches over the flattened remains of
raccoon road kill."|speech
73|NORMAN (CONT'D)|"Hey there little buddy! C'mere!
He realizes he is being stared at and slowly turns to
face the onlooker, then hurries away.
Though no one else sees them, to Norman's eyes, a whole
host of ghosts are meandering through the streets."|speech

86||EXT. MAIN STREET - MORNING|location
87|PARACHUTIST GHOST|"Its industrial days now rusted behind it, Blithe Hollow
has become a run-down tourist town, celebrating its
heritage with lame fetes and crass knick-knacks. A
massive billboard beside the main square reads ""BLITHE
HOLLOW - A GREAT PLACE TO HANG!"" illustrated by a group
of waving Puritans beside an equally cheerful witch
hanging from a gallows. Across the street a huge banner
suggests this year is particularly important for the
town; ""BLITHE HOLLOW - 300 BEWITCHIN' YEARS!""
The town center is lacking in charm; its historical
buildings subsumed into a vulgar modern thoroughfare with
gaudy witch-themed shop fronts and cracked sidewalks.
Everywhere Norman walks, the witch theme is prevalent.
Cars have bumper stickers that extol such witticisms as
""MY OTHER CAR IS A BROOM"". There's a dingy bar, the BAR
GENTO, and a greeting card store called BEST WITCHES.
Norman hurries past SHERIFF HOOPER, a heavyset black
woman, and DEPUTY DWAYNE, lanky and awkward and looking
like he'd rather be elsewhere."|speech
88|SHERIFF HOOPER|"Watch and learn. ""Parking
violation"" is my middle name."|speech
89|DEPUTY DWAYNE|"Really? I thought it was Rhona.
They glance up disdainfully as Norman passes by. Clearly
in this town Norman has something of a bad reputation."|speech

91|DEPUTY DWAYNE|"Norman walks up a tree lined path that leads to a squat
school building. Out front, the name ""BLITHE HOLLOW

ParaNorman 9."|speech
92||12 CONTINUED: 12|stage direction
93|DEPUTY DWAYNE|"SCHOOL KIDS line the path in front of Norman; a gauntlet
of jeering, merciless, pre-pubescent horror. Norman takes
a deep breath as he begins his daily walk of ridicule.
Most of the kids give him a wide berth, but others sneer
and WHISPER as he passes.
A bell RINGS the start of the school day, and everyone
makes a bee-line for the building.
Someone barges Norman with their shoulder, knocking his
backpack to the ground. Other kids SNICKER as they step
over him.
As the last of them head through the lobby doors, Norman
is left alone on the path.
Norman bends down to retrieve his spilled possessions,
and a dark shape beyond the gate catches his eye.
NORMAN'S POV - Mr Prenderghast, barely visible as he
stands within the shadow of a tree, stares back at him.
Norman frowns and squints his eyes, but now sees only
trees and shadows, so he continues up the steps."|speech

95||INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY, LOCKERS - MORNING|location
96|DEPUTY DWAYNE|"An expanse of unevenly lacquered floor, scuffed by scores
of dragged heels. Rows of dented lockers line the walls.
Norman stands before his locker, across which someone has
daubed the word ""FREAK"" in marker. Clearly something of a
daily ritual, he reaches inside, takes out a bottle of
surface cleaner and a rag and proceeds to wipe it off.
Across the hallway, another kid is removing graffiti from
his locker. NEIL is overweight with frizzy red hair, and
is busily rubbing a handkerchief over the word ""FATTY"".
He watches Norman with interest.
A voice behind his shoulder gives Norman a start."|speech
97|ALVIN|"Hey, ghost jerk! You know what?
Norman turns to find textbook bully ALVIN, the only 6th
grader in his class who shaves, looming over him. He is
flanked by a couple of leering sycophants, one of whom
wears a T-shirt emblazoned with ""TEAM ALVIN"".
Norman SIGHS."|speech

ghosts, goober?

off some more."|speech

Alvin points to a fly that has landed on the locker
beside him. He swats it flat with his hand."|speech
103|ALVIN (CONT'D)|"Talk to that.
The kids around Alvin burst into LAUGHTER."|speech
104|ALVIN (CONT'D)|"That is so Alvin!
The bullies strut away, content in the psychological
damage they've managed to inflict."|speech
105|PUG|Loser!|speech
106|ALVIN|"That was good, right guys?
Norman mutters as they leave, but not loud enough so as
anyone might hear."|speech

SALMA, a nerdy Indian kid with braces."|speech

111|SALMA|"Amidst stacked bleachers, foam mats and stray dodge
balls, a crudely constructed stage fills one end of the
gymnasium. Mediocre art class scenery represents a
colonial town, complete with plywood hills, chapel and
crescent moon dangling perilously from a basketball hoop.
In a director's chair far too small for the job is MRS
HENSCHER, an imposing woman with spectacles and beret who
looks like she smells of too-much perfume.
At the front of the stage wearing a pilgrim hat and
carrying a large scroll, is NORMAN. He is surrounded by
kids whose attempts at home made period costume leave a
lot to be desired.

114|(A BEAT)|"Pilgrims? The Mayflower? Don't any
of you know anything about the
history of this town?
Mrs Henscher tries her best to remain unfazed.
MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)
Puritans were strict and devout
settlers, who came here to build a
home, a place without sin. What is
it now Salma?
Salma is holding her hand up. She looks like the Wicked
Witch of the West. Even beneath green makeup and plastic
warty nose, it is clear she is not best pleased."|speech
115|SALMA|"Why is the witch always a hideous
old crone with a pointy hat and a
broomstick? I don't believe it's
historically accurate, Mrs
Henscher!
Mrs Henscher's knuckles clench white around her script.
She attempts an understanding smile, in the same way a
shark might."|speech
116|MRS HENSCHER|"It's not supposed to be. It's
supposed to sell postcards and key
chains."|speech
117|(CLAPS HANDS)|"So let's try it again. Top of page
six, Norman.
Norman skips ahead on his scroll."|speech
118|NORMAN|"The founding fathers of Blithe
Hollow discovered an evil witch
amongst them..."|speech

living dead; their souls doomed to
an eternity of damnation!"|speech
123|(A BEAT)|"Now I want you to try that again,
but with conviction! My reputation
is at stake here, and I won't have
this turn out like that wretched
Kabuki debacle of oh-nine!
As she launches into her lecture, Norman notices a change
in the room. The lights dim, the wind outside picks up,
and indistinct shapes flicker at the corners of his eyes.
Norman glances around at the other kids on the stage, to
see if they are seeing what he is seeing. For a split
second the children are replaced with faded figures in
real Puritan dress. Seven solemn figures.
As he turns around nervously, Norman sees the suggestion
of another place fizzing in and out of the shadows...
MRS HENSCHER (CONT'D)
Norman! Are you listening to me,
boy?
Norman is brought back to the real world with a start,
and nods timidly from behind his scroll."|speech
124|NORMAN|Sorry, Mrs Henscher.|speech

other issues, let us resume...
They put her on trial and hanged
her!
Neil turns excitedly to Norman."|speech
126|NEIL|"Ooh! This is my moment!
He shuffles toward Salma and swings his branch around,
not realizing Alvin has slung the hangman's noose around
Norman's neck.
Norman is yanked off balance and staggers into Neil who
keels over, rigid branch arms unable to stop his fall. He
lands on top of Salma, her kicking legs sticking out from
under him as though Dorothy's house had just landed on
stage.
The kids break into uncontrollable LAUGHTER.
