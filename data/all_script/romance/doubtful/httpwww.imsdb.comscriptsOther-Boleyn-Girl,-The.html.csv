You don't secretly wish you'd married

No. I want a husband who loves me. And

Then you've found the right man.

ANNE is dancing with her brother GEORGE. She looks up to see the
NOBLEMAN who was staring at her across the church..
ANNE
Who is that? He was staring at me in

That's Henry Percy. Heir to the Duke of

SIR THOMAS
What? And make a bastard King of
England?
NORFOLK
A legitimized bastard. What choice does
he have?
(a beat)
Obviously, I've given it thought, and
wondered which Howard girl I could put
under his nose. Imagine the influence
that would give us. To be blood family
of the next King of England. Equally,
imagine if another family were to
achieve the same?
NORFOLK indicates SIR JOHN SEYMOUR in the corner, and his two
loathsome, ambitious sons EDWARD and THOMAS..
SIR THOMAS
What about Anne?
SIR THOMAS turns, and indicates ANNE across the crowds, who's
dancing with GEORGE...
SIR THOMAS
I realise as a `Boleyn' she is not
officially a `Howard', but as your
sister's daughter..
NORFOLK
But she's your eldest, Thomas. Your
first born. And your favourite. Wouldn't
you prefer her to have a nice,
uncomplicated, respectable marriage?
Like Mary?
SIR THOMAS
If Anne were an uncomplicated,
respectable girl like Mary, then I'd say
`yes'. But she's not.
SIR THOMAS looks out at ANNE..

MARY smiles, in anticipation of pleasure. A side to her one

But one or two strokes later, and WILLIAM's knuckles whiten, his
face reddens, then he cries out, and slumps on top of her.

intimidating lot.
Behind them, comes the KING's CONFESSOR, a Priest with a large

Then, in a riot of colour, come the MUSICIANS, the FOOL and the
PLAYERS, led by the MASTER of the REVELS.
Behind them, come the SQUIRES and PAGES, carrying the King's
weapons, his jousting kit, his swords, his armour, his lance,

each other. Locked to one another. Blissfully unaware of and
uninterested in anyone else. Silently counting the minutes
before they can tear off one another's clothes..

now drinking heavily, drowning his jealous sorrows..

hisses through a fixed smile..
SIR THOMAS
For God's sake, it's the wedding of our
youngest child attended by the King of
England and the greatest Lords in the

That for someone with such great wealth,
and power..he has surprisingly little
authority as a man.
HENRY
Hah!
ANNE
And is SO consumed by one particular
rivalry he can barely think.
HENRY
eally? And who is this rival?
ANNE
A neighbouring King, who's name one is
forbidden to mention at court. Whose
reputation haunts him in his thoughts
and dreams.
ipples of laughter, as people guess..
ANNE
Whose armies and navy thwart his every
endeavour. Whose physical and
intellectual endowments are known far
and wide.
ENRY laughs too. Enjoying this..
ANNE
In order to restore his confidence, this
French King spends a fortune on anything
that glitters, on building of castles
with large towers..
ANNE artfully gestures the phallic implications..
ANNE
But these symbols of wealth and virility
fail to convince. Talk among the ladies
at court in France suggests..
A
ANNE stops herself...
HENRY
What?
ANNE
That in this department too, the King
has his shortcomings.
ANNE's gesture, (discreetly wiggling her small finger). HENRY
stares for a moment. A deathly silence. Has she gone too far?
