the streetlight --
Where two 20-ish ASSHOLES are sitting in his 1965 Mustang
convertible, their presence courtesy of a huge cut they've
made in the otherwise-perfect ragtop.
Car-theft tools in a leather case between them, they're prying
the ignition switch out of the dashboard.
Asshole #1 spots Carson. He gets out of the car, wielding a
crowbar. His partner keeps working.
NEW ANGLE
Asshole #1 lunges viciously, swiping at Carson with the
crowbar, taking a piece out of his side. Carson starts
BLEEDING profusely, but he's too pissed to notice.
Carson uses his bat to take the offensive. They go at each
other like combatants in a swordfight, the CLANKING of metal
echoing through the neighborhood along with the screaming
house and car ALARMS, and frantic neighborhood DOGS.
Surprised at Carson's fury and strength, Asshole #1 backs onto
the lawn, oblivious to the running SPRINKLERS.
As he backs away, his shoe catches on one of the sprinkler
heads. It breaks off, and a huge GEYSER of water sprays out.
Carson holds his bat in both hands and jams the front of it
into Asshole #1's breadbasket. He doubles over.
Carson grabs Asshole #1's arm, and pulls it quickly against
his raised knee. There is a SNAP and a loud howl as the arm
breaks, and Carson tosses him aside.
Seeing this, Asshole #2 gives up on the car. He takes off
toward the street. Carson runs to head him off, but he's a lot
faster in his Air Jordans than Carson is in his bare feet.
WIDER
Carson grabs the metal lid from a garbage can at the curb and
FLINGS it like a huge Frisbee. It sails across the street --
And NAILS Asshole #2's head. He kisses the pavement, stunned.
Carson runs up and grabs him, but he pulls out a long, sharp
screwdriver and jabs at Carson with it.

WESTEC Chevy Blazer. Two uniformed GUARDS get out, and fumble

Carson revs down so he can listen for Javal's machine. He
HEARS it up above and takes off, up a steep flight of stairs.
NEW ANGLE
Javal has reached the summit, only to find he's boxed in. He
can either turn around, or take the neighborhood's unique,
outdoor elevator, housed in a free-standing, three-story
concrete tower.
He jumps off his bike. Carrying the saddlebags, he runs into
the elevator -- but it needs a key to operate.
Javal comes back out, panicking.  He HEARS Carson coming up
the hill. He spots a GARDENER watering nearby with a hose.
ANGLE WITH CARSON
as he reaches the summit. He sees Javal's motorcycle,
abandoned, lying on its side...
And then he sees the Gardener, sprawled on the ground, a
BULLET HOLE in the center of his forehead.
Carson turns off his motorcycle and pulls out his Sig 9mm. He
moves slowly toward the elevator tower and looks inside.
HIS POV
The casement window in the back of the tower is broken. One end
of the gardener's hose is tied to a grate, and the hose is
hanging through the broken window.
Carson looks out the window as Javal climbs down the outside of

CLOSER
From the series of jerking, slipping MOVEMENTS, it is clear
the copter is not going to stay where it is for long.
The Geo's passenger side door pops open. Javal, panting with
fear, jimmies his foot against the dashboard and holds the
steering wheel to keep from falling out.
ANGLE ON VEHICLES BELOW
In the clog of traffic, cars swerve away, rapidly reverse...
anything to get away from the area below the impact.
JAVAL
reacts to another SLIP. The big saddlebags of money on the
seat start to slide toward the open door.
He gingerly reaches over to grab them... the copter SHIFTS
again... he loses his grip...
And, clutching the saddlebags, he TOPPLES out of the car.

Carson pulls out his Sig 9mm and FIRES several times at
