Within moments a legitimate desire to connect with his
daughter has escalated into a search for clues.  He opens
her drawers, dumps little boxes, pulls things off of shelves.
He becomes increasingly unhinged, flinging things around her
room.  He tosses a stack of magazines.  A fashion magazine,
airborne, discharges some contents: a lighter, a plastic
tube and a piece of folded aluminum foil fluttering to the
ground.
Robert stares at the foil on the carpet.  It's charred on
the outside.  He picks it up.  And unfolds it.  There's a
dried milky white substance.
He picks up the tube and lighter and stares at them.  Then,
somewhat tentatively, he puts the tube in his mouth.  He
holds the lighter under the foil, then heats the milky
substance which turns translucent and disappears in a cloud
of smoke.  Robert sucks all of it in.
He waits a long time then exhales.  His eyes shut.  The tube
drops from his mouth.  He staggers and, overwhelmed by the
sensations, sits on the bed.  The lighter and foil fall from
his hands.
A moment later he opens his eyes and doesn't seem to know
