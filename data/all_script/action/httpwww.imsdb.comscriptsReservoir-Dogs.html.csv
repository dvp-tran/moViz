MR. BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT,

are enjoying coffee and conversation.  Joe flips through a
small address book.  Mr. Pink is telling a long and
involved story about Madonna."|stage direction
5|MR. PINK|"""Like a Virgin"" is all about a
girl who digs a guy with a big
dick.  The whole song is a
metaphor for big dicks."|speech
6|MR. BLUE|"No it's not.  It's about a girl
who is very vulnerable and she's
been fucked over a few times.
Then she meets some guy who's
really sensitive--"|speech

about, no argument about that."|speech

13|NICE GUY EDDIE|"You don't remember ""True Blue?""
That was a big ass hit for
Madonna.  Shit, I don't even
follow this Tops In Pops shit, and
I've at least heard of ""True
Blue."""|speech

Madonna fan."|speech

tuned out."|speech

nice girl who finds a sensitive
fella.  But ""Like a Virgin"" was a
metaphor for big dicks."|speech

Virgin""'s about.  It's about some
cooze who's a regular fuck
machine.
I mean all the time, morning, day,
night, afternoon, dick, dick,

dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dick."|speech

serious dick action, she's feelin
something she ain't felt since
forever.  Pain."|speech
27|JOE|Chew?  Toby Chew?  No.|speech
28|MR. PINK|"It hurts.  It hurts her.  It
shouldn't hurt.  Her pussy should
be Bubble-Yum by now.  But when
this cat fucks her, it hurts.  It
hurts like the first time.  The
pain is reminding a fuck machine
what is was like to be a virgin.

I haven't heard that since I was
in fifth fuckin grade."|speech
51|NICE GUY EDDIE|"When I was coming down here, I was
playin it.  And ""The Night the
Lights Went Out in Georgia"" came

the lady singing the song, was the

cheatin wife, too."|speech

make enough money, she can quit."|speech
83||Everybody laughs.|stage direction
84|NICE GUY EDDIE|"I don't even know a Jew who'd have
the balls to say that.  So let's
get this straight. You never ever
tip?"|speech
85|MR. WHITE|"I don't tip because society says I
gotta.  I tip when somebody
deserves a tip.  When somebody
really puts forth an effort, they
deserve a little something extra.
But this tipping automatically,
that shit's for the birds.  As far
as I'm concerned, they're just
doin their job."|speech
86|MR. BLUE|Our girl was nice.|speech

thing you need is another cup of
coffee."|speech
95||They all laugh.|stage direction
96|MR. WHITE|"These ladies aren't starvin to
death.  They make minimum wage.
When I worked for minimum wage, I
wasn't lucky enough to have a job
that society deemed tipworthy."|speech
97|NICE GUY EDDIE|"Ahh, now we're getting down to it.
It's not just that he's a cheap
bastard--"|speech
98|MR. ORANGE|--It is that too--|speech
99|NICE GUY EDDIE|"--It is that too.  But it's also
he couldn't get a waiter job.  You
talk like a pissed off dishwasher:
""Fuck those cunts and their
fucking tips."""|speech

counting on your tip to live?"|speech

the world's smallest violin,

you're talking about.  These
people bust their ass. This
is a hard job."|speech
104|MR. WHITE|"So's working at McDonald's, but
you don't feel the need to tip
them.  They're servin ya food, you
should tip em.  But no, society
says tip these guys over here, but
not those guys over there.  That's
bullshit."|speech
105|MR. ORANGE|"They work harder than the kids at
McDonald's."|speech
106|MR. WHITE|"Oh yeah, I don't see them cleaning
fryers."|speech
107|MR. BROWN|"These people are taxed on the tips
they make.  When you stiff 'em,
you cost them money."|speech
108|MR. BLONDE|"Waitressing is the number one
occupation for female non-college
graduates in this country.  It's
the one jab basically any woman
can get, and make a living on.
The reason is because of tips."|speech
109|MR. WHITE|Fuck all that.|speech
110||They all laugh.|stage direction
111|MR. WHITE|"Hey, I'm very sorry that the
government taxes their tips.
That's fucked up.  But that ain't
my fault.  it would appear that
waitresses are just one of the
many groups the government fucks
in the ass on a regular basis.
You show me a paper says the
government shouldn't do that, I'll
sign it.  Put it to a vote, I'll
vote for it.  But what I won't do
is play ball.  And this non-
college bullshit you're telling
me, I got two words for that:
""Learn to fuckin type.""  Cause if
you're expecting me to help out
with the rent, you're in for a big
fuckin surprise."|speech

dollar back."|speech

Okay, when an alarm goes off, you
got an average of four minutes

car is cruising that street, at
that particular moment, you got
four minutes before they can
realistically respond.  In one
minute there were seventeen blue

I had a connection with this
hippie chick up in Santa Cruz.
All and my friends knew it.  And
they'd give me a call and say,
""Hey, Freddy, you buyin some, you
think you could buy me some too?""
They knew I smoked, so they'd ask
me to buy a little for them when I
was buyin.  But it got to be
everytime I bought some weed, I
was buyin for four or five
different people.  Finally I said,
""Fuck this shit.""  I'm makin this
bitch rich.  She didn't have to do
jack shit, she never even had to
meet these people.  I was fuckin
doin all the work.  So I got
together with her and told her,
""Hey, I'm sick of this shit.  I'm
comin through for everybody, and
nobody's comin through for me.
So, either I'm gonna tell all my
friends to find their own source,
or you give me a bunch of weed,

when's the next time you're gettin

some, I'll let you know.""  And
then these rinky-dink pot heads
come by--there's my friends and
everything, but still.  I got all
my shit laid out in sixty dollar
bags.  Well, they don't want sixty
dollars worth.  They want ten
dollars worth.  Breaking it up is
a major fuckin pain in the ass.  I
don't even know how much ten

man, I don't want that much
around.  If I have that much
around I'll smoke it.""  ""Hey, if
you guys can't control your
smokin, that's not my problem.

count me out.  But as it turns
out, I'm the best guy she had, and
she depended alot on my business.

it.  And she's trying to talk me
into not quitin.

situation, 'cause I don't know if
you remember back in '86, there
was a major fuckin drought.
Nobody and anything.  People were
livin on resin and smokin the wood
in their pipes for months.  And
this chick had a bunch, and was
beggin me to sell it.  So I told
her I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot

little bit and sell it to my
close, close, close friends.  She
agreed to that, and said we'd keep

the black Beverly Hills."""|speech

it's the black Palos Verdes.
Anyway, this chick, Elois, was a
man-eater-upper.  I bet every guy
who's ever met her has jacked off
to her at least once.  You know
who she looked like?  Christie
Love.  'Member that TV show ""Get
Christie Love""?  She was a black
female cop.  She always used to
say ""You're under arrest, sugar."""|speech

chick who played Christie
Love?"|speech

was the other one.  Pan Grier made

882|MR. PINK|"What the fuck was that chick's
name?  Oh this is just great, I'm
totally fuckin tortured now."|speech
883|EDDIE|"Well, whoever she was, Elois
looked like her.  So one night I
walk into the club, and no Elois.
Now the bartender was a wetback,
he was a friend of mine, his name
was Carlos.
So I asked him ""Hey, Carlos,
where's Lady E tonight?""  Well
apparently Lady E was married to
this real piece of dog shit.  I
mean a real animal.  And
apparently he would so things to
her."|speech
884|FREDDY|"Do things?  What would he do?  You
mean like beat her up?"|speech
885|EDDIE|"Nobody knows for sure what he did.
We just know he did something.
Anyway, Elois plays it real cool.
And waits for the next time this
bag of shit gets drunk.  So one
night the guy gets drunk and
passes out on the couch.  So while
the guy's
inebriated, she strips him naked.
Then she takes some crazy glue and
glues his dick to his belly."|speech

Eddie and myself, who you already
know, you'll be using aliases.
Under no circumstances are you to
tell one another your real name or
anything else about yourself.
That includes where you're from,
your wife's name, where you
might've done time, about a bank
in St. Petersburg you might've
robbed.  You guys don't say shit
about who you are, where you been
or what you've done.  Only thing
you guys can talk about is what
you're going to do.  This way the
only ones who know who the members
of the team are are Eddie and
myself.  And that's the way I like
it.  Because in the unlikely event
of one of you getting apprehended
by the cops, not that I expect
that to happen - it most
definitely should not happen - it
hasn't happened, you don't have
anything to deal with.  You don't
know any names.  You know my name,
you know Eddie's name.  That I
don't care about.  You gotta prove
it.  I ain't worried.  Besides,
this way you gotta trust me.  I
like that.  I set this up and
picked the men I wanted for it.

approached all of you.  I know

operation is to catch Joe Cabot
red-handed.  We bust these hired

Letting them go through with the
heist is a risk, but Cabot's jobs
are very clean.  We got people
surrounding the perimeter.  We got
a guy and a gal on the inside

footwear together, he's a goner."|speech

his mouth and did his time.  He
did four years for us, and he did
'em like a man.  And we were very
grateful.  So, Mr. Orange, you're
tellin me this very good friend of
mine, who did four years for my
father, who in four years never
made a deal, no matter what they
dangled in front of him, you're
telling me that now, that now this
