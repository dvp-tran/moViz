1||"FADE IN:
A PAIR OF SMOKESTACKS AGAINST AN ORANGE AUTUMN SUN SKY...
THE CAMERA ZOOMS OUT to REVEAL: A CEMETERY in the
foreground. TOMBSTONES blend into a NEVER-ENDING SEA OF
MIDDLE-CLASS ROW HOUSES in the distance, and nothing seems
to separate the two. A NEWLY DUG GRAVE is in the LOWER
LEFT-HAND CORNER of our FRAME.
MILITARY DRUMS. HUNDREDS of POLICEMEN, in their DRESS
BLUES, ENTER from FRAME RIGHT. A FEW COPS CARRY a COFFIN.
SUPERIMPOSE ON THE SCREEN'S LEFT SIDE: THE FOLLOWING WORDS
FADE IN--PARAGRAPH BY PARAGRAPH:
New York, New York.   1988.
A new breed of narcotics has swept the great city, bringing
with it a ferocious crime wave more terrifying than any in
recent memory.
The old criminal order is gone. In its place, new ethnic
groups rise up to seize control without respect for
traditional rules of engagement.
Outmanned and outgunned, demoralized by cutbacks and
scandal, the Police find themselves burying one of their
own at the rate of twice a month...
The WORDS TURN BLOOD RED, then DISAPPEAR. The POLICE LOWER
THE COFFIN when they arrive at the SITE. As we begin to
ZOOM INTO a CLOSE ANGLE ON THEM, we HEAR MUSIC. A THUMPING
POP BEAT. THE CLASH'S ""ROCK THE CASBAH""..."|stage direction

19||INT. EL CARIBE NIGHTCLUB - MAIN ROOM|location
20||"A huge, bustling, vibrant nightclub, very `80's. Decadent,
pure New York. BOBBY emerges from the back room area,
straightening out his outfit. ROSARIO is behind him,
fixing herself and walking toward the front of the club.
Bobby enters the PULSING, VITAL HEART of the place. As he
appears, everyone approaches, happily shouting out his
name. He is having a blast.
Bobby is the master of this domain. An `80's version of
Tony Manero from SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, but without kitsch.
He is genuine cool. MUSIC: BLONDIE'S ""HEART OF GLASS.""
Bobby waves hello to people, greets them (""Hey, baby!""), a
pretty girl kisses him (the women love him). Moves with a
swagger, a DANCE. As he sways, he re-buttons his shirt,
claps his hands. He is the CLUB MANAGER, and HE LOVES
every minute of it. He's GIDDY, ALIVE, a PERMANENT GRIN.
WE WANT HIS LIFE. SENSUOUS, SEDUCTIVE, INCREDIBLE FUN."|stage direction

A MAN waves to BOBBY. Bobby SEES: seated at a table,

scarred, huge black pompadour, big gut. One of his men,
PAVEL LUBYARSKY, is next to him. Bobby nods back to them.
NEAR THE COAT CHECK
Rosario meets up with several of her girlfriends, and we
SEE an OPERATION at work: people come get their coats,
slide the coat check girls a HUNDRED BUCKS, and with their
coats the patrons get JUNK put in their jacket pockets.
Rosario looks to one of her girls--ALINA, a young Russian
with too much makeup--and counts the cash. Pockets some of
it. From Rosario's BEHAVIOR, we SEE she's INVOLVED in the
DRUG TRADE."|stage direction

and SECURITY GUYS are in the melee. Girls SCREAM. ROSARIO
moves past all this, to the front door. LOUIS FALSETTI,
forty, backs off from the multiple struggles all around
him. Louis is wearing a jacket that says ""SECURITY"" on it.
He is the jocular type, very overweight, redfaced. Bobby
arrives at the fight scene. With cheery braggadocio:"|stage direction

puts him in a headlock. He gives the Patron a SHOT TO THE
TEMPLE, just to keep him docile. Lou, Bobby's best friend,
watches the imbroglio with an amused and cowardly
detachment, CHORTLING with every punch and scream. He
balances a drink in his hand with marvelous care, avoiding
spillage. But the BATTLE GETS CLOSER AND CLOSER. Seeing
his friend Bobby, who's hardly got everything in control:"|stage direction

Everyone laughs as he goes out the door. Bouncer FREDDIE
helps clean up the mess. A GIRL SCREAMS as a GUY is
flipped on his back by bouncers. A PATRON with BLOOD ON
HIS FACE, acting like an eight year-old, to Bobby (who
hurls his guy out of frame):"|stage direction

We HEAR RADIO MUSIC up here, nothing like the stuff played
downstairs. A RUSSIAN CROONER. In an EASY CHAIR sits
MARAT BUZHAYEV (pronounced BOO-SHY'-EV). He is old,

Russian (""He said he didn't want any food, and you keep
trying to give it to him!"") breaks out between the old

GRUSINSKY'"". Cases filled with trophies. Food tables,
piled high. And beer. Lots and lots of beer.
Many COPS are drinking, cavorting, smoking CIGARS, making
sandwiches. And DANCING UP A STORM. Men and women FLIRT,
GAB, MAKE OUT. FLASH! Pictures taken constantly. A mass
of people surround TWO PEOPLE as a PHOTO is taken:
ANGLE ON: JOSEPH GRUSINSKY, thirties. Bobby's OLDER
BROTHER. In uniform. Clean-cut, though not neurotically
so. Sharp, tough features--the GLOW of a WINNER. He is
SMILING, receiving many AD-LIBBED CONGRATULATIONS and
holding one of his children in his arms, infant PAUL. Next
to him is his wife, SANDRA, thirties. Next to her, their
older infant, TEDDY.
NEXT TO JOSEPH: BURT GRUSINSKY, sixty. Bobby's father, we
will soon learn. Tough as nails. Unsentimental, ex-
military, rough-edged, vital. In this world, he is a king.
Standing behind Burt are his two closest associates:
MICHAEL SOLO (""G.Q.""), fifties, somewhat urbane, and JACK
SHAPIRO (""Pudge""), also fifties. A big, quiet man. Huge
hands. The enforcer. Burt is beaming over his treasured
son. He directs a PHOTOGRAPHER, repositions Joseph:"|stage direction
