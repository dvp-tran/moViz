GASPS, sinking downward.  He's on his knees now, in shock.
Drake ROARS again shifting, conjuring up seventy centuries of
violence and predation.  And the nightmare shape that was only
hinted at before, finally takes center-stage.
BLOOD suffuses Drake's flesh, turning his skin crimson.  His
canines elongate, his lower jaw distends.
Jagged bone spurs erupt all over his body -- like he's growing
a suit of razor-sharp thorns.  He doesn't need a sword
anymore.  He's become a living weapon.  Drake is gone.  Now he
is --

Drake swings the sword overhead.  He's going to decapitate
Blade.  And just as the sword reaches the top of its arc --
ZOE
emerges from the shadows behind Drake, clutching a silver
stake.  She SHOVES it into Drake's back,  pushing with all the
strength her little body can muster.
Drake staggers.  The blow wasn't lethal, but it hurt all the
same.  He turns on Zoe, enraged, his attention distracted for
one crucial second --
ON BLADE,
summoning the last of his reserves.  He pitches his body
forward, managing to snag the end of the plague arrow.  And
before Drake even realizes what is happening --
WHAM!  Blade sinks the plague arrow deep into Drake's chest.
Drake drops the sword, turning back to face Blade --
Exhausted beyond measure, Blade sags.

expelled.  We continue shrinking until we are moving with the

throat.  We can see the virus infiltrating her system as tiny
BLACK THREADS expand across her face.  She sways, falling onto
the floor.  She reaches a beseeching hand towards King --

choking, going into convulsions.  As they writhe on the floor,
