In the darkness, we hear a voice, a woman's voice.  Her name
is Evey."|stage direction||
2|EVEY (V.O.)|"""Remember, remember, the fifth of
November, the gunpowder treason and
plot.  I know of now reason why the
gunpowder treason should ever be
forgot."""|speech|EVEY|F
3||"Her voice has a strength that is metered by a calmness, a
deep centered peace that we can feel."|stage direction||
4|EVEY (V.O.)|"Those were almost the very first
words he spoke to me and, in a way,
that is where this story began,
four hundred years ago, in a cellar
beneath the Houses of Parliament."|speech|EVEY|F
5||"In the darkness, we find a lantern.  Guy Fawkes, a dangerous
man who wears a goatee, is struggling with a wheelbarrow
stacked with barrels of gunpowder."|stage direction||
6|EVEY (V.O.)|"In 1605, Guy Fawkes attempted to
blow up the Houses of Parliament."|speech|EVEY|F
7||"The wheelbarrow bumps over the heavy stone mortar of the
cellar floor.  From the dark depths, we hear the sound of
dogs."|stage direction||
8|EVEY (V.O.)|"He was caught in the cellars with
enough gunpowder to level most of
London."|speech|EVEY|F
9||"Guy sees lanterns coming from both sides.  He tries to run as
the dogs reach him first.  He grabs for his sword as dozens
of pole axes pin him against the tunnel's stone wall."|stage direction||
10|EVEY (V.O.)|"Sometimes I wonder where we would
be if he hadn't failed.  I wonder
if it would have mattered."|speech|EVEY|F
11||In the dim pre-dawn light, Guy is led to the gallows.|stage direction||
12|EVEY (V.O.)|"I suppose the answer is in the
rhyme.  More than the man, what we
must remember is the plot itself."|speech|EVEY|F
13||"The coarse noose of rope is snugged up to Guy's throat.  He
looks into the crowd until he finds a face, a woman's face,
staring up at him."|stage direction||
14|EVEY (V.O.)|"For in the plot we find more than
just a man, we find the idea of
that man, the spirit of that man,
and that is what we must never
forget."|speech|EVEY|F
15||"The lever is thrown and the woman looks down, a tear falling
down her face."|stage direction||
16|EVEY (V.O.)|"This, then, is the story of that
idea, of that spirit that began
with an anarchist's plot four
hundred years ago."|speech|EVEY|F

morning sun."|stage direction||

so afraid that the world was going

happen."|speech|EVEY|F

watching the news.  From the look on their faces, the news is
bad."|stage direction||

century's turn.  I don't remember
the market crash or the plague or
any of the Trafalgar riots."|speech|EVEY|F

fighting in a shelled city."|stage direction||
26|EVEY (V.O.)|"I've read about them since but I
don't recall how any of them
impacted my life except for the

return to a bygone age, an age of
tradition, an age of values that
have been disparaged and all but
forgotten.  What this country needs

leader with the strength of his
moral convictions to do what must
be done.  I give you that man!  I
give you our leader!  Adam Susan!"|speech|DASCOMBE|M

at her mother and again they clasp hands."|stage direction||

backwards.
But more than his strength, it is his speed.
A gun is cocked but before the hammer falls, a knife is
buried in the Fingerman's chest and --
Before the body falls, the knife is gone.
It takes a handful of seconds and three bodies lay on the
ground.  V turns to the last Fingerman who is struggling to
pull his pants up."|stage direction||

music rises and we recognize Tchaikovsky's 1812 overture.
The music mounts a climax and V points the wand at Big Ben as
cymbals crash --
Big Ben explodes with such force the world seems to shake,
while --
V, smiling, always smiling, points again with another
crescendo and --
The statue of justice is blown to smithereens.

computer system.
It is a cerebral cortex for a vast intelligence network.
Information can almost be felt coursing through its hard

launch for the fireworks.  These
appear to be individually weighted
flares and we have found traces of
the same chemicals at both of the
detonation sites which leads us to
conclude that, despite a level of
sophistication, these devices are
all home-made with over the counter
chemicals, making them impossible
to trace.  Whoever he is, Leader,
he's good."|speech|FINCH|M
