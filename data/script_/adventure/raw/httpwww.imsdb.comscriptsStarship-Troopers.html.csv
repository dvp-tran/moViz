me no doubt another failure...
Rico, pay attention !"|speech
41||"The teacher JEAN RASCZAK, 38, a rugged veteran who proudly
displays his missing hand, scowls at Johnny, bemused."|stage direction
42|JOHNNY|Sorry, Mr. Rasczak.|speech
43||"But as soon as Rasczak turns back to the class, Johnny begins to sketch
a cartoon on his desk's touch screen."|stage direction
44|RASCZAK|"Here in History and Moral Philosophy
we've explored the decline of
Democracy when social scientists brought
the world to the brink of chaos, and how the
veterans took control and imposed a stability
that has lasted for generations since...
You know these facts but have I taught you
anything of value ? You.
Why are only citizens allowed to vote ?"|speech
45||Rasczak points at LANNY, 17, with his stump|stage direction
46|LANNY|"It's a reward... what the Federation gives you
for doing Federal Service."|speech
47||Rasczak is crestfallen, makes a big show of patience.|stage direction
48|RASCZAK|"No. Something given has no value !
Haven't I taught you dimwits anything ?
I guess they ought to revoke my
teaching credential..."|speech
49||"Laughter. Johnny's cartoon, meanwhile, is taking shape:
Johnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship."|stage direction
50|RASCZAK|"When you vote, you're exercising political
authority. You're using force. And force, my
friends, is violence, the supreme authority
from which all other authority derives."|speech
51||CARL JENKINS, 18, a superintelligent geek, jumps in.|stage direction
52|CARL|"Gee, we always thought you were the
supreme authority, Mr. Rasczak."|speech
53||Laughter. Rasczak grins.|stage direction
54|RASCZAK|"In my classroom, you bet. Whether it's
exerted by ten or ten billion, political
authority is violence by degree. The
people we call citizens have earned
the right to wield it."|speech
55||DIZZY FLORES, 18, athletic, pretty, no nonsense, chimes in.|stage direction
56|DIZZY|"My mother always says that violence
never solves anything."|speech

Hiroshima would have to say about that.
You."|speech

59|CARMEN|"They probably wouldn't say anything.
Hiroshima was destroyed."|speech
60||"Johnny presses ´""SEND"" on his desk, and the cartoon appears
across the way on Carmen's screen."|stage direction
61|RASCZAK|"Correct. Naked force has settled more
issues in history than any other factor.
The contrary opinion 'violence never
solves anything' is wishful thinking
at its worst."|speech
62||"While Rasczak looks away, Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful
smile, and Johnny's gone, checked out, flying round Venus."|stage direction
63|RASCZAK|"People who forget that always pay...
They pay with their lives and their
freedom."|speech
64||"Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face.
So does Rasczak. He points at him with his stump,
snaps Johnny to."|stage direction
65|RASCZAK|"You. Tell me the moral difference,
if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?"|speech
66|JOHNNY|"The difference lies in the field of civic
virtue. A citizen accepts personal
responsibility for the safety of the body politic,
of which he is a member, defending it,
if need be, with his life.
The civilian does not."|speech
67|RASCZAK|"The exact words of the text. But do
you understand it ?
Do you believe it ?"|speech
68|JOHNNY|Uh, I don't know.|speech
69|RASCZAK|"Of course you don't. I doubt if any
of you here would recognize 'civic virtue'
if it bit you in the ass."|speech

112|JOHNNY|Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.|speech
113|BIOLOGY TEACHER|"Just a bug, eh ? We humans like to think we are
Nature's finest achievement. I'm afraid it isn't
true. This Arkellian Sand Beetle is superior in many
ways. It has fewer moving parts, can reproduce itself
in vast numbers, and unboud by concerns of ego and
mortality, makes the perfect selfless member of
society."|speech

fluid sprays from the slit. Carmen turns away looking ill."|stage direction
116|BIOLOGY TEACHER|"Our galaxy is teaming with insect life. We have
identified over two billion species so far.
Human, life, it would seem, is the anomaly."|speech
117|CARMEN|"But we 're intelligent. Human minds have invented
art, mathematics and interstellar travel."|speech
118|BIOLOGY TEACHER|"True, we know of no insect society that has
produced a Shakespeare, an Einstein or a
Cherynkov, but before you let that go to your
head, take the example of the Arachnids, a
highly organized, highly evolved insect society."|speech
119||"She points to an insect evolution chart that starts with a
common ant and ends with a two meter tall ARACHNID WARRIOR."|stage direction
120|BIOLOGY TEACHER|"They are relatively stupid by human standards. Workers
have an IQ of 12, warriors around 35 , and yet the
Arachnids have colonized planets. Over a million years
of evolution, Nature has provided the Arachnids with the
biological means to hurl their spore into space."|speech

open with aresounding crack. Bug guts gush out."|stage direction

a teenager. You can't be a citizen when
you're only a teenager !"|speech
146|CARMEN|"It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich
they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff
means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran."|speech
