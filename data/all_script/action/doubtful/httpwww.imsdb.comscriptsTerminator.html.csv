audible.  A LOW ANGLE bounded on one side by a chain-link
fence and on the other by the one-story public school build-
ings.  Spray-can hieroglyphics and distant streetlight sha-
dows.  This is a Los Angeles public school in a blue collar
neighborhood.
ANGLE BETWEEN SCHOOL BUILDINGS, where a trash dumpster looms
in a LOW ANGLE, part of the clutter behind the gymnasium.
A CAT enters FRAME.  CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, prowling with
him through the landscape of trash receptacles and shadows.
CLOSE ON CAT, which freezes, alert, sensing something just
beyond human perception.
A sourceless wind rises, and with it a keening WHINE.
Papers blow across the pavement.
The cat YOWLS and hides under the dumpster.
Windows rattle in their frames.
The WHINE intensifies, accompanied now by a wash of frigid
PURPLE LIGHT.  A CONCUSSION like a thunderclap right over-

FRAME comes to rest on the figure of a NAKED MAN kneeling,
faced away, in the previously empty yard.
He stands, slowly.
The man is in his late thirties, tall and powerfully built,
moving with graceful precision.
C.U. - MAN, his facial features reiterate the power of his
body and are dominated by the eyes, which are intense, blue
and depthless.  His hair is military short.
This man is the TERMINATOR.
He glances down, taking calm inventory of himself, and
notices that a fine white ash covers his skin.  He brushes
at it unconcernedly as he walks toward the fence, scanning
his surroundings."|stage direction

eyes open, twitching.
The leader whips out his SWITCHBLADE and slashes in one
motion.  Terminator ducks back and catches the knife-
wielder's wrist in an inhuman grip.  Then he punches the
leader with piledriver force just below the breastbone.
ANGLE - PAVEMENT, as the knife clatters down.  The punk's
combat boots are on tiptoe, barely touching the ground.
ANGLE - TWO SHOT, Terminator and the leader are close
together as if dancing, but motionless.  Their bodies are in
total shadow.  The punk's eyes are wide, his veins distended
with an agonizing pressure.  Terminator jerks his fist back
with a WET SOUND and the other drops OUT OF FRAME.
The last tough is stumbling away, gaping with terror.  He
backs into a chainlink fence, turns to run along it, finds
he is in a corner.

The streets glisten, hissing with sporadic late night traffic.
SLOW PAN AND DOLLY into the mouth of a narrow alley lined
with trash containers and fire escapes.  From a recessed
doorway, two filthy legs sprawl out onto the wet pavement.
An angry, inarticulate DRUNKARD'S MONOLOGUE rises occasionally
above the rain sounds.

A NAKED MAN, compact and muscular, rises in a defensive
crouch.  KYLE REESE is 22, but his face has been aged by
ordeal, the mouth hard, eyes grim.  A crinkled burn scar
traverses one side of his face from chin to forehead.  Other
scars, from burns and bullets, mar his hard-muscled body.
The rain washes a fine coating of white ash from his skin
as electrical ARCS lace back and forth between the fire
escapes behind him, HISSING and SPUTTERING.  The sound
fades, then stops altogether, to be replaced by a rising
scream of animal agony.

gasp.  CLOSER ANGLE reveals that he has been skewered through
the abdomen by the horizontal iron slats and through the
shoulder by a railing.  He has materialized in the same
space occupied by the fire escape structure.  The figure
slumps, motionless.
Reese quickly checks for signs of life.  The man is dead.
Reese descend to the alley floor and crosses to the drunk
huddled in the doorway.
A pair of flamboyantly dressed women, obviously working
girls, passes by the alley mouth.  They do a double take

completely jaded.  He's certainly not a potential customer.

There is the sound of EXPLOSIONS, distant, and an intermittent
electronic WHINE.  Incredibly bright searchlights play over
the ground.  PANNING with the moving treads through twisted
wreckage, F.G.
The screen WHITES OUT with a BLAST, very close.  As the
debris clatters down, a helmetted head snaps up into FRAME,
EXTREME F.G.
The visor of the HIGH-TECH HELMET is shattered, presumably
by the explosion.  The wearer rips it off, revealing a
younger Reese, minus his burn scar.
His face is bathed in sweat, lit by the glow from a CRT
SCOPE-SIGHT on a strange-looking rifle.

continuous low murmuring of RADIO CHATTER, grid coordinates,
casualties, unit placements, medic requests.
Reese looks over his shoulder at his teammate, a GIRL
of about sixteen, gaunt, dirty, heavily armed like himself.
DOLLYING as they start to belly crawl through the bones
and wreckage.
Reese looks up.
Through spires of a collapsed building a terrifying
SPHINX-LIKE SHAPE moves against the sky...obscured by dust
and blinding sweeps of its searchlights.
Though we see little, this is an H-K,Hunter-Killer
mobile ground-unit.
Reese crawls, pacing the H-K, under and through, on elbows
and knees, past mounds of charred skulls.  They
pass the BODY OF A CHILD, a boy of about 10, center-
punched with a smoking hole.  The boy clutches a rifle.
More bodies.  Some in rags, some in uniforms like theirs.
WOMEN. OLD MEN. CHILDREN.  They're all dirty and gaunt,
scabrous.  And still bleeding.  Reese scrabbles past a
dark rat-hole and there are human rats in it.  Some of them
are sobbing, or screaming.
Another EXPLOSION.
The GLARE lights the huddled few.
Human vermin with mud-caked weapons that haven't been
invented yet.  Soldiers in a nightmare war.
Reese and his teammate stop behind a blasted wall, having
outflanked the massive H-K.  Its flashing blue lights flick
across the walls, its searchlights sear through the
debris.
WIDER, showing the H-K more clearly...a blast-scarred
CHROME LEVIATHON, with hydraulic arms folded mantis-like
against its 'torso', and huge underslung GUN TURRETS.
Reese leaps up and straight-arms a satchel-charge into its

Guns and searchlights swivel.  The head turns ponderously.
Reese's partner rises, poised to throw hers.
A POWER-BOLT catches her at the top of her arc, BLOWING
HER INTO RED MIST.
Reese is knocked down by the concussion.  Gets up, running,

The H-K's tread carriers are RIPPED APART.
It lurches to a stop, burning.

would be considered insane.  Here it is merely very good.
The machine gun CHATTERS.
A BLACK SHAPE descends, a demon with searchlights.
A BOLT OF LIGHT.
Reese's car flips like a kicked beer can, rolling and

It is Reese.

Reese turns, his eyes flickering to the mirror, the figure.
C.U. - REESE as he mechanically raises his beer.  His knuckles
are white.  He slowly undoes the top button of his overcoat.
There is a glint of metal in the shadows within.
Reese turns slowly on his barstool as the figure brushes past

Terminator sits motionless for a BEAT.
Blue eyes so pure and deep.  The eyes of a saint, perhaps.
The .45 is out and cocked and AIMED DIRECTLY AT CAMERA, almost
in one motion.
The bore seems enormous.
BACK ON SARAH, over the gun barrel, her eyes go wide.  We hold
a BEAT, like a frozen slice of nightmare.
MEDIUM ON REESE as he whips the riot-gun to a hip-firing posi-
tion, his overcoat falling back with a snap.  HE FIRES.
ON TERMINATOR, as the shotgun blast hits his arm and he FIRES,
simultaneously.  Sarah screams as the .45 round blows stuffing
out of the booth seat inches from her face.  Her hair is
singed by burning gunpowder.  An involuntary cry is punched
out of her by the double concussions.
Reese is stroking up another shell as Terminator half-rises
from booth.
OVER REESE'S SHOULDER, as he fires, cocks the slide, fires
again, advancing on Sarah's booth.
Terminator is blown backward over the center divider,
crashing through the glasses and pitchers of beer on the
table opposite, and onto the floor.
Sarah is screaming, scrunched down in the booth.
Terminator is lying on his back at the feet of a table-
full of drunk patrons.
He has two rifled 12 gauge slugs in his chest and one
in the arm.
The bar customers are frozen in the weird tableau, cowering,
gaping.
Sarah stops screaming.
Reese stand motionless, gun aimed.
In the sudden silence, the sound of him cocking the shotgun
is abnormally loud.
ON TERMINATOR, very still.
Then he smoothly rolls to a crouch and slips the UZI machine
pistol from beneath his overcoat, where it has been hang-
ing on a shoulder strap.
He doesn't seem too impaired as he swings around to fire.
Reese rolls like a cat and comes up firing.
A burst from the UZI rakes the bar where he stood.
An orgy of shattering glass.
Total pandemonium.
SEVERAL ANGLES  as patrons of the bar run, scream or dive
for cover, depending upon their level of intelligence.
Reese slides through the glass to Sarah's booth and seizes
her wrists.
ON TERMINATOR, kneeling amid the chaos, raising the UZI
one-handed.
Reese tugs viciously on Sarah's arm and she sprawls across
the booth seat a moment before the divider and seat cushion
erupt with hits from the UZI.
ANGLE ON A RUNNING PATRON as a burst of 9mm fire catches
him in the chest.  He pitches into Sarah's booth, pinning
her.
Reese fires, ducks, fires again.
Tables crash over.
A window is blown out.
A table candle rolls into a pool of high-proof alcohol
behind the bar.
It ignites with a WHOOSH.
Reese feed two shells into the riot-gun.
TIGHT ON TERMINATOR, an island of slow, precise movement
amid the confusion.  He drops a spent clip.  Reaches for
another with his bloody hand.
MOVING WITH REESE as he vaults the row of booths and starts
firing.  At point blank range he unloads the shotgun into
