make out a large, ominous building:  the HOUSE of William
Nix.  Its walls are white-washed and scrawled with GRAFFITI.
The ""family"" of IDOLS surrounds the doorway, guarding it. ON

against the door-frame is a scrawny, wild-eyed YOUTH, about
sixteen.  His name is BUTTERFIELD.  He's got a brooding,
almost sultry look on his face.  One of his eyes is black,
the other milky blue.  He's whittling something with a
scalpel. Distantly, the sound of CAR ENGINES.  Butterfield
narrows his eyes.
BUTTERFIELD'S P.O.V.
The Volkswagen ""bus"" and Thunderbird are approaching the

13||"The house no longer serves any domestic function.  It has
become the temple and dormitory of Nix's small apocalyptic
cult.  As we go through the house with Butterfield we glimpse
a little of what life here is like.
The rooms are murky, and chaotic.  The walls, PAINTED with
scenes of cities and landscapes BURNING, and creatures from
some unspeakable nightmare ATTACKING, RAPING, and DEVOURING
helpless humanity.  The atmosphere is joyless, and
oppressive.
The passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his
way to the heart of the house.  Only OIL LAMPS, set on the
floor, light these claustrophobic corridors."|stage direction||

their leader, WILLIAM NIX.  His black hair grows to his
shoulders.  His eyes are deep and glittering, his voice
seductive.  A terrifying yet charismatic presence.
All the Cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives -
wear the same simple T-shirts, painted with the cult's SIGIL.
They watch Nix in adoration.
As Nix speaks, he juggles a FLAME, passing it from hand to
hand with casual ease..."|stage direction||

knotted rope.  It is vaguely cruciform, but its swaying,
