The dog trots out across the property. It stops to scratch.

reflected in its eyes. The dog whimpers
Back at the farmhouse, a deep, dull thud shakes the ground,
bringing the small girl back out onto the veranda. An orange
glow pulsates somewhere out in the darkness."|speech|GIRL|M|

inherited this place. Word got out

happened, so I didn't really have
any friends. Kids used to throw
stones at the house and call me

bullet explodes from the gun, straight at us. Angle on the
bullet as it passes in ECU. The shot moves round behind the
bullet to reveal PAUL, looking shocked. The bullet whizzes
past him, slamming into one of the soldiers.
ZOIL rolls, coming to rest on one knee. He fires a second
shot into the leg of the other soldier who collapses. He
leaves his gun at VOICE just as the PILOT bursts from the
cockpit. The PILOT fires but misses ZOIL. ZOIL takes out his
shoulder, spinning him off his feet. VOICE steps forward,
holding a smoking gun."|speech|PAUL|M|True
