prudent answer is we don't know."|speech

don't know what's happening inside the
Kremlin at that level."|speech

agreement.  If we permit the
introduction of nuclear missiles to a
Soviet satellite nation in our
hemisphere, the diplomatic consequences
will be too terrible to contemplate.
The Russians are trying to show the
world they can do whatever they want,
wherever they want, and we're powerless
to stop them.  If they succeed..."|speech
241|BOBBY|It will be Munich all over again.|speech
242|RUSK|"Appeasement only makes the aggressor
more aggressive.  Confidence in our
security commitments around the world
will falter, allies will become unsure
in the face of Soviet pressure, and the
Soviets will be emboldened to push us
even harder.  We must remove the
missiles one way or another.  It seems
to me the options are either to build up
the crisis 'til they give in, or we hit
them.  An air strike."|speech

scenarios.  Before I ask General Taylor
to lead us through the various options,
I'd like for us to adopt a rule.
If we are going to strike, we must agree
now that we will do it before the
missiles become operational.  Because
once they are, I don't think we can
guarantee getting them all before at
least some are launched."|speech

going out and bombing them."|speech

sense - and I'm not saying there are -
we need 'em.  Need 'em fast."|speech

think we may need to start letting key
people know.  And they're all scattered

staff in and warmed up.  Jesus... I
don't even know if we've got secure
communications with half our embassies

us on the Bay of Pigs."|speech

dismissed the diplomatic option.  The

negotiation, and leave us short of our
goal, the removal of the missiles.

give them time to make the missiles
operational, complicating the necessary
military task we have at hand."|speech

that the Soviet withdraw the missiles
within 12 to 24 hours.  They will
refuse.  When they do, you will order
the strikes, followed by the invasion.
They will resist, but will be overrun.
They will retaliate against a target

IRBMs.  They can hit every city in the
continental U.S."|speech

back to Air Force Chief of Staff GENERAL CURTIS LEMAY, 60.
Beetle-browed, arrogant, the archetypal Cold War general.
Yet there is something about him, his intelligence perhaps,
that suggests he's playing a role he knows and believes in.
The only other civilians in the room are Bobby, Bundy and
McNamara.  The pressure from the military is almost physical."|stage direction

planes are ready to carry out the air
strikes.  All you have to do is give me
the word, sir, and my boys will get
those Red bastards."|speech

We're looking at another week and a

plans call for an eight-day air
campaign.  It'd light a fire under the

446|THE PRESIDENT|"General LeMay, do you truly believe
that's our best course of action?"|speech
447|LEMAY|"Mr. President, I believe it is the only
course of action.  American is in
danger.  Those missiles are a threat to
our bomber bases and the safety of our
nuclear deterrent.  Without our
deterrent, there's nothing to keep the
enemy from choosing general nuclear war.
It's our duty, our responsibility to the
American people to take out those
missiles and return stability to the
strategic situation.  The Big Red Dog is
digging in our back yard, and we're
justified in shooting him."|speech

is 'Peace is our Profession.'  God
forbid we find ourselves in a nuclear
exchange.  But if launched, those
missiles in Cuba would kill a lot of
Americans.  That's why I'm being such a
pain in the ass about destroying them.
Destroying them immediately.  Hell, even
Mac agrees."|speech

A WOMAN sits in one of the chairs for visitors.  Dressed in
gray.  Prim.  But beautiful.  A secretary of some sort.
One of the double doors to the hall swings silently open.
Kenny glides in.  He sees the other door shut at the far end

Kenny WHISTLES two notes.  Stops.  And then he begins to
WHISTLE the Irish tune, O'Donnell Aboo.  He gets a bar into
it -- and there's a polite, soft COUGH.
Kenny stops.  Then notices the Woman in gray across the room.
He didn't see her.  It's dim over there.  She looks at him,
expressionless.
The CAMERA FINDS: a pin on her lapel.  A RED HAMMER AND
SICKLE.
Kenny reacts.  Dobrynin's assistant?  His opposite number?  A
friend?  Or more than a friend?
Here is the face of the enemy.  Not a smile between them.
Kenny resumes his ease.  And begins to WHISTLE again.
The haunting Irish song echoes in the vaulted ceiling,
filling the dim room.  Strange, sad, beautiful.  The woman
listens.  And her face begins to soften.
Kenny stares at the dark, lonely windows, his SONG striving
to fill the empty room.
Kenny sinks deeper in the chair, his tune all-consuming...
and the Woman's voice breaks in.  Kenny stops, looks over.
Her voice is tremulous and beautiful.  Just a snatch of some
song in Russian.  She stops, awkward.
Kenny stares.  The Woman stares back.  No smiles.  But in
