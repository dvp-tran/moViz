3||"Something evil is lurking deep withing the wooded moun-
tains of Tennessee, and the camera takes its point of
view. Rising from a swampy bog, the mud slides from view
allowing it to see early morning mist hanging about the
forest. Creeping silently past trees, gliding over small
shrubs, it moves onward through the woods until a mammoth
oak rests directly in its path. The tree is uprooted by
this unseen force, and falls with a deafening crash."|stage direction||

5||"Near by, a stretch of highway curves along the base of
a mountain. The road winds off into oblivion beyond other
peaks. From behind view, the rumble of an engine can be
heard. It is a large logging truck headed south. Moving
away, the truck becomes smaller until finally it disap-
pears in the distance. From where the truck emerged, a
dilapidated gold 1973 Oldsmobile comes into view."|stage direction||

and LINDA, SCOTT and SHELLY, and CHERYL, ASHLY's sister.
Both SCOTT and SHELLY wear ""Michigan State"" T-shirts,
and are students along with the others at that univer-
sity. SCOTT is driving and SHELLY sits next to him up
front. ASHLY, LINDA and CHERYL are in back. They listen
to an old ""Baby Moses And The Thrillers"" song on the
radio, and SHELLY is slapping the dash board as if it
were a drum."|stage direction||

ED - W"|unknown||
15||"Once again, the camera takes the point of view of the
dark and brooding force which stops atop a forest ridge
to peer downward. Its view focuses upon the 1973 Olds-
mobile speeding along the narrow highway below."|stage direction||

You trying to kill us?"|location||

steering wheel. The damn thing jerked
right out of my hand."|location||

76||"Okay, okay- then to a wild week-end
in a wonderful cabin with good friends,
(She glances at SCOTT) provided we
live that long."|location||
77||"SHELLY cooly drinks from the Scotch and passes the bottle
back to ASHLY and LINDA. ASHLY pours LINDA a drink in the
bottle cap and keeps the bottle. They raise their drinks."|stage direction||
78||ASHLY and LINDA|unknown||
79||...With good friends.|location||
80||"They toast, drink and react to the strong liquor. ASHLY
tries to hide his reaction to the Scotch in front of
LINDA, since SHELLY had reacted so calmly. ASHLY passes
the bottle to CHERYL who stops him with a polite ""No,
thank you,"" then back up front to SCOTT."|stage direction||
81||LINDA|unknown||
82||"Hey Scotty, what's this place like
anyway?"|location||
83||SCOTT|unknown||
84||"Well, the guy that's renting it says
it's an old place, little run down,
but it's right up in the mountains-
totally secluded. (He takes a drink
from the bottle) Best part is, we
get it so cheap."|location||
85||LINDA|unknown||
86||Why are we getting it so cheap?|location||
87||SCOTT|unknown||
88||"I don't know, might be in real bad
shape."|location||

98||Actually, it might be very nice.|location||

100||Yeah...|location||
101||SHELLY|unknown||
102||It's probably a real pit.|location||
103||CHERYL|unknown||
104||"I can't believe that we're renting
a place for a week-end that nobody's
seen."|location||
105||SCOTT|unknown||
106||"(Mumbling to himself) Jesus Christ,
not this again..."|location||
107||CHERYL|unknown||
108||"(Turning to ASHLY) You know, mom and
dad would never let us go up to a place
like this if they knew-"|location||

125||SCOTT|unknown||
126||Yeah, more like adventure.|location||

128||Any adventure in particular?|location||

130||Shelly's sweater.|location||

133||"(Teasing) Oooh, you're gonna get it
Scotty, when you least expect it,
you're gonna get it good."|location||

over a great chasm. Carefully, the vehicle crosses."|stage direction||

ED - CAB"|unknown||
137||"It is late afternoon when they eventually arrive at their
destination. The small wooden cabin is surrounded by
thick dark woods. SCOTT shuts off the car but it contin-

but I'm just not paying for it."|location||
142||LINDA|unknown||
143||This place is perfect.|location||
144||CHERYL|unknown||
145||"The woods come awfully close to the
house don't they?"|location||
146||SCOTT|unknown||
147||"So what's wrong with the woods, they
can't bite ya."|location||
148||CHERYL|unknown||
149||"It's just a little claustrophobic
that's all."|location||
150||LINDA|unknown||
151||Well, I think it's beautiful.|location||
152||SHELLY|unknown||
153||"Me too, it's gonna be a bomb week-
end."|location||
154||"22
ED - CAB"|unknown||
155||"SCOTT moves to the front door of the cabin where he finds
a small ring of keys concealed on the shelf above the
door. ASHLY unloads the car to the others."|stage direction||
156||SCOTT|unknown||
157||"It's supposed to be one of these on
here."|location||
158||After trying several keys, he is able to unlock the door.|stage direction||
159||"23
ID - M.R."|unknown||
160||"The interior of the cabin is completely dark. SCOTT
opens the door and stands silhouetted in the doorway
for a moment, then enters to find the light switch.
The illumination reveals floors, walls, and ceilings
made of cedar. There are two small bedrooms, a kitchen,
and the main room which contains a stone fireplace set
into the wall. An old grandfather clock stands silently
in one corner, partially hidden in the shadows. A door
in the rear of the cabin leads to a small work shed
containing a work bench and an assortment of tools upon
the wall. Located centrally in the main room is a trap
door leading to the cellar. This catches SCOTT's eye."|stage direction||
161||SCOTT|unknown||
162||Hey, this place has a dungeon.|location||
163||"CHERYL puts down a case of art supplies, and moves over
to SCOTT by the trap door. He unlocks a chain securing
the trap door with one of his keys and hands the ring
to SHELLY."|stage direction||
164||SCOTT|unknown||
165||Put these back will you?|location||
166||"SHELLY leaves with the keys, and SCOTT tries to open the
hatch but cannot."|stage direction||
167||SCOTT|unknown||
168||They nailed it shut.|location||
169||CHERYL|unknown||
170||"Good, I don't like cellars. Probably
just some garbage down there anyways."|location||
171||SCOTT|unknown||
172||"Cheryl, they don't nail garbage in
cellars. I mean it's not going to
try and get out or anything."|location||
173||CHERYL|unknown||
174||Well, what's down there?|location||
175||SCOTT|unknown||
176||"Well, could be any number of things.
Old baseball cards, mushrooms, dead
bodies-"|location||
177||LINDA|unknown||
178||Hey, look at this!|location||
179||"LINDA is standing in the corner next to the old grand-
father clock. She repositions a balance weight, and it
begins to tick."|stage direction||
180||LINDA|unknown||
181||Ta daaaaaa!|location||
182||The others applaud and whistle. LINDA smiles.|stage direction||

184||The cabin is seen from the outside. Twilight has come.|stage direction||
185||"25
IT - M.R."|unknown||
186||"CHERYL sits alone in the living room near the window. She
is drawing sketches of the old clock. As she works, the
ticking stops unexpectedly. CHERYL puts down her pencil
and looks up to the clock. It stands silently in the cor-
ner with its hands frozen in position. There is a rust-
ling from the woods. CHERYL looks out the window but can
see only the trees. Something is moving outside, yet re-
mains hidden within the forest. A gust of wind fills the
room. CHERYL glances down at her hand. It turns a pale
white and begins to shake and jerk about uncontrollably.
She stares on incredulously as her hand, guided by some
unseen force picks up the pencil and begins to sketch
a figure upon her pad. The wind gales through the open
window but dies down slowly as her hand completes the
drawing. Whatever was at the edge of the woods has now
retreated further into them. Her hand loses the pale
cast and is now under control once more. CHERYL picks
up her pad of paper. The likeness of a book with some
form of ancient writing on its cover has been sketched.
She looks to the woods which are now silent. A snapping
of wood is heard from the cellar. CHERYL quickly turns
to the trap door still nailed shut in the floor. Pos-
sibly just a mouse, but she fixes her gaze upon it.
Another sound, almost like faint breathing comes from
the cellar."|stage direction||
187||"26
IT - K/M.R."|unknown||
188||"ASHLY and LINDA enter from the kitchen. ASHLY is drink-
ing a beer and moves over to CHERYL. He stands between
her and the trap door."|stage direction||
189||ASHLY|unknown||
190||What're you drawing Cheryl?|location||
191||"He picks up the piece of paper. LINDA looks over his
shoulder to glance at it."|stage direction||
192||CHERYL|unknown||
193||I...I don't know.|location||
194||ASHLY|unknown||
195||Is it a bible?|location||
196||CHERYL|unknown||
197||"No, no it's no bible. (She glances
again at the cellar, knowing some-
thing is down there) I don't know
what it is."|location||
198||LINDA|unknown||
199||"Well, this one of the clock's not
bad."|location||
200||"LINDA picks up the sketch and walks over to the clock
with it a few steps away. She stands comparing it to
the real thing with her back to CHERYL and ASHLY. She
is only a few inches from the trap door, and CHERYL
wants to call out in warning when ASHLY kneels in front
of her to speak secretly."|stage direction||
201||ASHLY|unknown||
202||(In a whisper) I got it right here.|location||
203||"He taps something in his shirt pocket. CHERYL is looking
past him paying no attention. She watches only LINDA's
feet, waiting for whatever is in the cellar to grab them.
LINDA looks at the drawing in comparison."|stage direction||
204||LINDA|unknown||
205||"Cheryl, this is really good. I like
how you did the numbers in that wood-
ish style."|location||
206||"ASHLY produces a small box from his shirt and opens it
quickly to show CHERYL. It contains a gold pendant on
a necklace. LINDA takes a step closer to the clock. She
is now standing almost upon the trap door. Although
nailed shut, it opens slightly, pulling the nails with
it. CHERYL gasps. ASHLY is pleased with her response."|stage direction||
207||ASHLY|unknown||
208||"(Still in a whisper) I knew you'd
like it."|location||
209||"Quickly, he places it back in his shirt and touches his
lips with a finger to indicate the secrecy of his sup-
rise. LINDA returns with the sketch and places it back
on CHERYL's small drawing table."|stage direction||
210||LINDA|unknown||
211||"It's really good Cheryl. Very close
to the origional."|location||
212||CHERYL|unknown||
213||"(In a relieved whisper) Yes, very
close."|location||
214||LINDA|unknown||
215||I'm gonna check dinner.|location||
216||LINDA returns to the kitchen and ASHLY turns to CHERYL.|stage direction||
217||ASHLY|unknown||
218||"You better get washed up. I'll see
ya in there."|location||
219||"He winks, then follows LINDA into the kitchen. CHERYL
again looks at the cellar. Slowly, from her point of
view, the camera moves in toward the trap door, wait-
ing...waiting."|stage direction||
220||"27
IT - K"|unknown||
221||"A blender screams as it mixes up a drink in the kitchen.
SHELLY shuts it off and carries it to the dining room."|stage direction||
222||"28
IT - D.R."|unknown||
223||"She joins the others who are now seated at the dinner
table and serves the mixture. SCOTT sits between LINDA
and CHERYL. He leans over to CHERYL."|stage direction||
224||SCOTT|unknown||
225||"(In a whisper) Dead bodies in the
cellar, dead bodies in the cellar..."|location||
226||CHERYL|unknown||
227||Will you stop it?|location||
228||LINDA|unknown||
229||Scott, leave her alone will ya?|location||
230||SCOTT turns toward LINDA.|stage direction||
231||SCOTT|unknown||
232||"Will you relax, I'm just kidding
around. She can take a joke-"|location||
233||"He stops talking as he hears the trickling of water. He
turns to see CHERYL finish pouring a glass of water in
his lap. The others laugh. SCOTT is silent for a moment,
then begins chuckling to himself. He turns to CHERYL."|stage direction||
234||SCOTT|unknown||
235||(Jokingly) I'll get ya.|location||
236||With a napkin, he blots the water from his pants.|stage direction||
237||SCOTT|unknown||
238||I'll get ya for this Cheryl.|location||
239||ASHLY stands with his drink and raises the glass.|stage direction||
240||ASHLY|unknown||
241||"I'd like to make a toast for all
here this evening. As a greek friend
of mine once said, ""Nis-hat-nis-fert-
dis-ruben-tu-tar-im."""|location||
242||LINDA|unknown||
243||Which means?|location||
244||SCOTT|unknown||
245||Party down!|location||
246||"The laughter is stifled by a loud snap and cracking of
wood heard from the main room."|stage direction||

248||What the hell...|location||
249||All stand from the table and hurry to the main room.|stage direction||

IN - M.R."|unknown||
251||"The nails that held down the trap door have been ripped
out, and although still in tact, the hatch is wide open.
They stand silently in front of it, looking blank as to
what could have done this. CHERYL is slighly more nervous
than the others. ASHLY is the first to speak."|stage direction||
252||ASHLY|unknown||
253||(Slowly) What is this?|location||
254||SCOTT|unknown||
255||Whatever it is, it's still down there.|location||
256||CHERYL|unknown||
257||"I don't like cellars, let's close it
up. (She does not want to deal with
it) It's probably just some animal."|location||
258||SCOTT|unknown||
259||"An animal?! An an...ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-
that's the stupidest thing I ever
heard in my life. Jesus Christ."|location||
260||"SCOTT locates a flashlight and peers into the hole. He
traces the old wooden steps into darkness with his light."|stage direction||
261||LINDA|unknown||
262||Maybe it is just some animal.|location||
263||SCOTT|unknown||
264||"Yeah, probably right. It's probably
just some animal. Uh...Cheryl, why
don't you make sure."|location||
265||"He hands the flashlight to CHERYL who quickly gives it
back."|stage direction||

267||Scotty, I'm not going down there!|location||
268||SCOTT|unknown||
269||Okay, okay you cowards, I'll go.|location||

go down there. Why don't you wait
until morning."|location||

274||SHELLY|unknown||
275||"What melodrama! What courage! A kiss
my brave hero."|location||

the narrow steps into the cellars blackness."|stage direction||

the precious moment when you will
ascend."|location||

298||ASHLY|unknown||
299||Then get that lantern.|location||
300||"LINDA brings it over. ASHLY opens the kerosene valve,
lights the wick, and descends into the basement."|stage direction||
301||"30
IN - C"|unknown||
302||"Down below, ASHLY moves quietly past the old stone walls
and wooden beams which support the main floor above. In
front of him stands an old door which leads to another
section of the cellar. Cautiously, he moves toward it.
Before he can touch it, the door swings open slowly with
a moan. ASHLY moves through the doorway and deeper into
the cellar. Condensation from water pipes above turn the
cellar into an echo chamber as drips fall into shallow
pools on the dirt floor below. As ASHLY scans with his
light, he spots a shadow move out the corner of his eye."|stage direction||
303||ASHLY|unknown||
304||Scott?|location||
305||"ASHLY breaks into a cold sweat as he moves away from
the area where the shadow passed. He backs sqarely into
a pair of arms which grab him."|stage direction||

307||Ahhhhhhh!|location||
308||It is only SCOTT behind him.|stage direction||
309||ASHLY|unknown||

319||SCOTT|unknown||
320||Uh-uh.|location||
321||ASHLY|unknown||
322||What's this?|location||
323||"SCOTT sweeps his light to another corner and reveals
several items atop a small table. Beneath a dusty cloth,
he finds a book which appears to be covered in some sort
of animal hide, with an ancient form of writing on the
cover. Along with this book, SCOTT and ASHLY uncover
a reel to reel tape recorder, an ancient dagger, and
other parapanalia including a box of rifle shells."|stage direction||

IN - M.R."|unknown||
327||"The group sits huddled around the fireplace talking
quietly about school. The same bottle of Scotch is passed

entry from a small cabin in the south-

staying with my wife for a few weeks
so that I may continue my research un-
disturbed. Since May, a group of assoc-
iate professors and myself have been
excavating the ruins of Ca'n Dar. I
believe I have made an important find
in that area, and thus the reason for
this log. With it, I can keep an ac-
curate record of translations from
my latest find; the first of six, the
others still lost, volumes of ancient
Sumarian burial practices and rites.
Basically, it is a book of do's and
don'ts dealing with the deceased en-
titled ""Naturan Demanto"" roughly trans-
lated ""Book Of The Dead."" It is bound
in human flesh, and inked with blood
of the deceased..."|location||

deals with demons and demon resurrect-

meaning those forces believed to inhab-

translated warn that these demons are
dangerous, everpresent, and exist
primarily through this book. As legend
has it, only the sacred high priests
of the Ca'n Dar tribe could posess
these books, for they alone could
properly control the resurrected de-
mons. It is only through the act of
reciting the resurrection passage
that these demons would be able to
posess the living. For many years, it

be heard. She freezes. Whispering in the distance grows

yards behind her. She stops. No sound. Nothing moves.

turns but there is silence again. The winds die down,

around her ankles and slither up her legs. Tree branches

to break the hold but cannot. ASHLY also tries but with
a backhand blow, SHELLY knocks him into a cabinet, smash-
ing it to bits. A garbled cry for help escapes from
SCOTT's frothing mouth. SHELLY reaches down, picks up
the Sumarian dagger, and holding SCOTT by his throat
with one hand, she raises the dagger with the other.
ASHLY, slightly injured, crawls to his feet. SCOTT
grabs her raised arm and although choking, swings
his camping knife from its side sheath and slices
deep into SHELLY's raised wrist, almost severing it.
A murky black ooze pumps from the wound. She emits
an ear splitting- howl and tightens her grip on SCOTT's
throat. He drops the hunting knife. ASHLY watches
terrified, unable to move as SHELLY raises her dangling
hand (Still clutching the dagger) to her mouth and
bites it off. The useless part falls to the floor
with the dagger still firmly in its fist. SCOTT, now
almost dead, grabs her severed hand clutching the
dagger and in a last attempt, swings it around ramming
the blade into her spine.
SHELLY screetches along with CHERYL in the cellar, the
old grandfather clock gongs and lightning strikes all
at the same instant. SHELLY reaches around with her
remaining arm to clutch at the severed hand and knife
protruding from her own back. A thick black ooze pours
from the wound as she bends backward screaming. ASHLY
stands in horror, clutching the axe, unable to move.
Black ooze runs from SHELLY's mouth as her body writhes
about spasmatically upon the floor. Gradually, the move-
ments cease and she is dead. As SCOTT slowly stands to
his feet, SHELLY's arm grabs his leg."|stage direction||

it into her. Lightning flashes, thunder booms, and
CHERYL screams from the cellar. SCOTT brings his axe
down again and again in a frenzy. Then, after the
final chop, there is silence.

strange shadows on the ground as ASHLY digs LINDA's
grave. She lies on her back during the digging. One of
her eyes opens. It is white. ASHLY drops the shovel
and looks at her. She appears to be dead."|stage direction||

top of the dirt mound. He reaches down to pick it up
when LINDA's hand shoots up from beneath the grave and
grabs him! She pulls herself up out of the grave scream-
ing and clutches ASHLY's leg with a black and bloodied
hand. He twists around, trying to free himself, but she
will not let go. By now, LINDA is almost completely out
of the grave. With her fingernails, she rips into ASHLY's
leg, tearing his skin. Screaming, he picks up a large
log nearby and swings it roundhouse into her face again
and again, breaking the wood into smaller bits. She grabs
the log with him clinging to the other end, lifts him
up and throws ASHLY log and all, away from her. ASHLY
hits the ground with considerable force and for the
first time begins to comprehend the power of this thing
he is dealing with. Thick black ooze pours from LINDA's
nose and mouth as she turns toward ASHLY sprawled on
the ground."|stage direction||

she lunges toward him. From the ground, ASHLY swings the
spade upward, lopping off her head. The head falls into
the mud, but the body falls upon him, grabbing and jerk-
ing about spasmatically. Thick black ooze pumps from
her neck and ASHLY manages to pull himself out from
underneath the body. He backs away in disgust and falls.
He picks himself up again and sees LINDA's necklace
upon the ground. ASHLY stashes it in his pocket and
staggers back to the cabin."|stage direction||

and CHERYL is gone. ASHLY walks over and kicks it shut.
A slight breeze sweeps through the front door causing
SHELLY's bedroom door to creak open. ASHLY picks up the
rifle again and cautiously moves to the door."|stage direction||

clothes are inside. He turns toward the other end of

He swings and fires, shattering the window. CHERYL

reaching in. He slams the door on her fingers and rams
his gun butt down upon them. Horrible screams are heard
as CHERYL withdraws her hand. ASHLY is able to slam
the door and bolt it. He runs to the back entrance lead-
ing to the shed and locks it also. On his way back to
the main room, he pumps his rifle in preparation. It is
his last shell."|stage direction||

decends. The bottom step, now rotten, breaks under his
weight, and ASHLY sprawls to the floor. Slowly, he picks
himself up and walks through the dividing stone doorway
beneath the water pipes to a small table. On it, he finds
the box of shells and quickly loads them into the gun.
He ascends the steps and enters the main room once more."|stage direction||

up to see the old grandfather clock slowly winding back-
wards. He watches and waits tensely. Turning carefully,
ASHLY tries to monitor all the windows. The ticking grows
louder. A shadow passes in the window before him and he
fires, shattering the glass into a million pieces. Wind
whips through the cabin swirling glass and leaves to the
floor. ASHLY waits, leaning against the front door for
something to happen. He is tense and more determined
than ever to survive. He whispers to himself."|stage direction||

sound. All is silent. From behind, two arms rip through

the floor. The necklace is tossed away in the confusion.
CHERYL's hands pull away and she looks through a hole
in the door. From the floor, ASHLY raises his rifle and

turns with the gun, but SCOTT knocks it out of his hands.
Desperately, ASHLY grabs a table lamp and shatters it
across SCOTT's head, then jams the exposed socket into
his face, shocking him. SCOTT staggers back several
steps, then continues after ASHLY."|stage direction||
