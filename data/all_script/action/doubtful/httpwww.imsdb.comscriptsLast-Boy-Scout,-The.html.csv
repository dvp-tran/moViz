Feet pounding. Arms pumping.

Cole does not blink. He reaches beneath his jersey.
Pulls out a GUN.
Pumps THREE SHOTS into the free safety's head.
The bullets go straight through. On the back of his
helmet.
A mixture of blood and fiberglass.
Cole keeps going, jogging for the end zone.
Around him, sound. Fury. Impact. Confusion.
Another defensive back. Straight ahead.
Reacts with almost comical terror. Dives to one side.
Cole FIRES. Blows out the guy's knee. Ends a career.
Keeps going.
We are now in full-scale panic.
The players are fleeing the field. Shouts. Pandemonium.
A few brave men gather around the fallen players.
POLICE
are on the field now. Running full out. They've got
riot guns, cocked and locked. Sprinting through the
snow.
Cole crosses the goal line.   Touchdown.
Drops the ball.
Turns, facing the cops.   His eyes are insane.
The crowd is screaming. People are running back and
forth like extras in the Keystone Cops.
The first TWO BLASTS from the cops' RIOT GUNS go high and
wide. One SHOT BLOWS APART the base of the goalpost.
The forty-foot-high monument pitches over, collapsing
like a wounded giant. Lands in a shower of snow and ice.

Picks up the ball.    Smiles.
