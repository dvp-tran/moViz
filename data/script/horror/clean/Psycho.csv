2||EXT. PHOENIX, ARIZONA - (DAY) - HELICOPTER SHOT|location|||
3||"Above Midtown section of the city. It is early afternoon, a
hot mid-summer day. The city is sun-sunblanched white and
its drifted-up noises are muted in blanched their own echoes.
We fly low, heading in a downtown direction, passing over
traffic-clogged streets, parking lots, white business
buildings, neatly patterned residential districts. As we
approach downtown section, the character of the city begins
to change. It is darker and shabby with age and industry. We
see railroad tracks, smokestacks, wholesale fruit-and-
vegetable markets, old municipal buildings, empty lots.
vegetable The very geography seems to give us a climate of
nefariousness, of back-doorness, dark and shadowy. And secret.
We fly lower and faster now, as if seeking out a specific
location. A skinny, high old hotel comes into view. On its
exposed brick side great painted letters advertise ""Transients-
Low Weekly Rates-Radio in Every Room."" We pause long enough
to establish the shoddy character of this hotel. Its open,
curtainless windows, its silent resigned look so
characteristic of such hole-and-corner hotels. We move forward
with purposefulness and-toward a certain window. The sash is
raised as high as it can go, but the shade is pulled down to
three or four inches of the inside sill, as if the occupants
of the room within wanted privacy but needed air. We are
close now, so that only the lower half of the window frame
is in shot. No sounds come from within the room.
Suddenly, we tip downward, go to the narrow space between
shade and sill, peep into the room.
A young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed. She wears
a full slip, stockings, no shoes. She lies in and attitude
of physical relaxation, but her face, seen in the dimness of
the room, betrays a certain inner-tension, worrisome
conflicts. She is MARY CRANE, an tension, attractive girl
nearing the end of her twenties and her rope.
A man stands beside the bed, only the lower half of his figure
visible. We hold on this tableau for a long moment, then
start forward. As we pass under the window shade,"|stage direction|||

5||INT. THE HOTEL ROOM - (DAY)|location|||
6||"A small room, a slow fan buzzing on a shelf above the narrow
bed. A card of hotel rules is pasted on the mirror above the
bureau. An unopened suitcase and a woman's large, straw open-
top handbag are on the bureau.
On the table beside the bed there are a container of Coco-
Cola and an unwrapped, untouched egg-salad sandwich. There
is no radio.
The man standing by the bed, wearing only trousers, T-shirt
and sox, is SAM LOOMIS, a good-looking, sensual shirt man
with warm humorous eyes and a compelling smile. He is blotting
his neck and face with a thin towel, and is staring down at
Mary, a small sweet smile playing about his mouth. Mary keeps
her face turned away from him.
After a moment, Sam drops the towel, sits on the bed, leans
over and takes Mary into his arms, kisses her long and warmly,
holds her with a firm possessiveness. The kiss is disturbed
and finally interrupted by the buzzing closeness of an
inconsiderate fly. Sam smiles, pulls away enough to allow
Mary to relax again against the pillow. He studies her, frowns
at her unresponsiveness, then speaks in a low, intimate,
playful voice."|stage direction|||
7|SAM|Never did eat your lunch, did you.|speech|SAM|F|True
8||"Mary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her,
kisses him. Then, and without breaking the kiss, she swings
her legs over the side of the bed, toe-searches around, finds
her shoes, slips her feet into searches them. And finally
pulls away and sits up."|stage direction|||

boss excess acid."|speech|MARY|F|True
10||"She rises, goes to the bureau, takes a pair of small earrings
out of her bag, begins putting them on, not bothering or
perhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror. Sam
watches her, concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery,
humorous good mood. Throughout remainder of this scene, they
occupy themselves with dressing, hair-combing, etc."|stage direction|||

tries to raise the shade. It sticks. He pulls at it.
It comes down entirely, and the hot sun glares into the room,
revealing it in all its shabbiness and sordidness as if
corroborating Mary's words and attitude. Sam kicks at the
fallen shade, laughs in frustration, grabs on to his humor
again."|stage direction|||

216||"We see Mary's car drive in, come to a stop. There are no
other cars about, this being a gas station off the main
highway, and the attendant is obviously in the shack. Mary
looks worried about having to make this stop, keeps her face
turned away from the shack, not wishing it to be seen.
No one comes and for a moment Mary considers driving on, as
if the emptiness of the station were a warning, an omen that
she should listen to. But the gas registers almost empty.
She has to blow her horn.
A YOUNG MAN comes out of the shack, starts toward her car.
At that moment, we HEAR the RINGING of the TELEPHONE in the
shack. The Attendant walks a few steps further, toward Mary's
car, then decides to go back and answer the phone. The phone's
insistent ringing unnerves Mary.
She starts her car, zooms off.
We see the Attendant, phone in hand, in the doorway of shack.
He looks after the departing car with little or no expression.

MARY'S VIEWPOINT - A LARGE OLD HOUSE - (NIGHT)

some attention. She stands a few moments, waiting.
No one comes. Impatience and anger rise in Mary. She dashes
out into the rain, to her car, gets in, opens the side window,
begins to honk the horn. After a moment, a YOUNG MAN open
the front door of the house, pauses, starts down the path.
After a few steps, he turns and runs back into the house.
Mary leaves her car, starts a dash for the shelter of the
porch. As she runs, we see that the Young Man has gone back
only to get an umbrella. Seeing that Mary is on her way to
the porch, he runs quickly, the umbrella unopened in his
hand. He gets to the porch a moment after Mary has reached
it.
He stops short, looks at her, then at the umbrella hanging
useless in his hand, then back to her.
There is something sadly touching in his manner, in his look.
Mary's impatience goes and she smiles and this makes him
almost smile. He gestures her into the office, standing back
to indicate that he will go after her. She goes into the
office."|stage direction|||

But slowly, he is forced to surrender to the impulse and,
resisting himself, he goes to the wall, presses the side of
his head against it. The SOUNDS come louder, as if we too
had our ear pressed against the wall. Now Norman looks at a
picture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning
against. Slowly he starts toward it.
He reaches it, touches it, reluctantly lifts the small frame
off the wall.
A tiny circle of light hits Norman's face, coming from the
hole in the wall behind the picture. This end of the room is
very dim and thus we are able to see clearly the light
striking Norman's face.
We move close to Norman, extremely close, until his profile
fills the screen. The tiny spot of light hits his eye. See
the small hole through which the light comes. Norman peeps
through.
NORMAN'S VIEWPOINT
Through the hole we look into Mary's cabin, see Mary
undressing. She is in her bra and halfslip. She stoops over
a bit, places her hands behind her upper back, begins to
unhook her bra.
NORMAN - ECU
He watches as Mary removes her bra. We see his eye run up
and down the unseen figure of Mary.
NORMAN'S VIEWPOINT
Mary, just slipping into a robe, covering her complete nudity.
NORMAN
He turns from the hole, faces us for a moment, continues
turning until he can look out the small parlor window.
We see, as he sees...
THE HOUSE IN THE BACKGROUND
NORMAN
He turns his face away, quickly, resentfully. In his face we
see anger and anguish. And then resolve.
Quickly, precisely, he rehangs the picture over the hole in
the wall, turns, starts out of the parlor. We see him go
through the office and out onto the porch, not even bothering
to close the door behind him."|stage direction|||

enters. We see him pause at the foot of the stairway, look
up at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair. He
holds for a moment, and then his resolve and courage
evaporates. His shoulders slump, sadly, mournfully. He by-

small notebook. We see from these figures a calculation which
indicates her intention to make a restitution of the money
she has used of the forty thousand dollars. We see, too, her
bankbook. The paper reads thus: top figure, 40,000; directly
beneath it 500, the amount used for the new car; total after
subtraction, 39,500. In another spot we see a figure which
matches the balance in her bankbook; 624.00.
Beneath this is the figure 500, and the amount after
subtraction, 124.00. She studies the figures, sighs, not
wearily but with a certain satisfaction, with the pleasure
that comes when one knows that at any cost one is going to
continue doing the right thing. After a moment she tears the
page out of the notebook and, rising, begins to rip it into
small pieces. She goes into the bathroom, drops the pieces
into the toilet bowl, flushes the toilet. Then she drops her

Now we see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open.
The noise of the shower drowns out any sound. The door is
then slowly and carefully closed.
And we see the shadow of a woman fall across the shower
curtain. Mary's back is turned to the curtain. The white

As she turns in response to the feel and SOUND of the shower
curtain being torn aside. A look of pure horror erupts in

throat. A hand comes into the shot. The hand holds an enormous
bread knife. The flint of the blade shatters the screen to
an almost total, silver blankness.
THE SLASHING
An impression of a knife slashing, as if tearing at the very
screen, ripping the film. Over it the brief gulps of
screaming. And then silence. And then the dreadful thump as
Mary's body falls in the tub.
REVERSE ANGLE
The blank whiteness, the blur of the shower water, the hand
pulling the shower curtain back. We catch one flicker of a
glimpse of the murderer. A woman, her face contorted with
madness, her head wild with hair, as if she were wearing a
fright-wig.  And then we see only the curtain, closed across
the tub, and hear the rush of the shower water. Above the

edge of the bed.
FRESH ANGLE - BEHIND NORMAN
Norman sitting on bed, the bathroom in b.g. of shot. We can
see only the hand of the dead girl, lying along the tile
floor. Norman presses his eyes, fights to find a way out of
his dilemma. Slowly, a kind of settling comes upon him, the
peace that comes with decision.
Norman rises, goes to the window, looks out, and then, with
resolution, closes the window and draws the curtain across
it. Then he crosses to the front window, facing the porch,
and draws those curtains closed. Then he switches off the

office, the lights within go off and we HEAR a closet door

CAMERA is ANGLED that we see Norman only from the waist up.
Quickly and deftly he unhooks the shower curtain, emerges
with it into the bedroom. CAMERA PANS down and we see him
spread the shower curtain on the bedroom floor, just outside
the bathroom door. He spreads the curtain so that one end of
it comes up against the bathroom threshold and slightly over
and onto the tile floor. Again he goes into the bathroom and
CAMERA TILTS up so that we see only the upper half of Norman.
He works carefully, with his arms extended away from his
body, slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub, drags it
across the tile floor and onto the spread-out shower curtain
in the bedroom. Having arranged the body, he straightens up,
examines his hands, sees bloodstains on them. He returns to
the bathroom, goes to the hand-basin.
CLOSE SHOT
We see his hands being washed, see the bloodstains being
diluted and washed away by the gush of the faucet water.
NORMAN
We see Norman shake his hands free of the water, then turn
to the job of cleaning the bathroom.
He places the pail in the tub, runs water into it, dips the
mop in, swabs the tile floor. With a towel he wipes off the
wall over the tub and the edges and sides of the tub and
even the shower curtain rod. Then he takes a second towel
and goes over the cleaned areas, carefully drying them.

foot to pull the door open, and, leaving the door open behind
him, goes quickly across the porch and gently lays the body
in the trunk. He closes the lid then, but does not lock it.
He comes back into the cabin, closes the door completely,
flicks on the light.
Again the newspaper is in the foreground. For a moment he
pauses, closes his eyes against the realization of what he
is doing, then quickly pushes all thoughts away, continues
with his work. With the room lighted, he now proceeds to
gather up all Mary's articles and toss them into the suitcase.
He checks all drawers and the closet, gets down and checks
under bed and bureau, goes into the bathroom, checks that
room again, comes back into the bedroom, looks about
carefully, spots Mary's handbag, throws even that into the
suitcase, is finally satisfied that all traces of the girl
are gone from the room. Then he closes Mary's suitcase, picks
it up.
With his free hand he picks up the pail, in which are the

car trunk, raises it with his foot, throws the suitcase and
the pail into it, slams it shut. He pauses a moment, then
realizes he has left the bathroom light on in Mary's cabin.
He returns to cabin. As he enters, his eye is caught by the
newspaper on the bedside table. He goes to it, takes the
newspaper, and looks once again into the bathroom. His glance

swamp, seems doubtful of its ability to swallow up the car,
realizes he has no choice. He leans into the car, releases
the emergency brake, starts to push. The front of the car
begins to roll into the swamp. Suddenly there is the LOW,
THROBBING SOUND of a motor. Norman freezes, listens.
The SOUND grows louder and Norman realizes it is an airplane
flying overhead. The car is rolling quickly now. Norman jumps
away, slams the door shut, stands tense. The SOUND of the

of peaceful night air before retiring. Then he glances down
and CAMERA follows his gaze. A hose is lying on the ground
outside Mary's cabin, its stream of water obliterating the
tire marks.
After a moment, Norman's hand comes into shot, picks up hose,
places it in a new position. As CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see
that the water from the hose has erased and rearranged the
road markings so that it would be impossible to tell that a
car had been parked here.
After a short wait, Norman goes to the hose-faucet, turns it
off, unscrews the hose. As he rolls the hose, he walks away
from the spot, past the office, heading for the path that
leads to the house. He goes up the path, pauses at the steps
of the house, tosses the curled hose onto the lawn, goes up
the steps and into the house. CAMERA FOLLOWS him in, PAUSES

On the landing he stops. The door to his mother's room is

the room, instantly disturbed by it, almost chilled, her
expression indicating an impulse to close the door and go
away from this room forever.
After a moment, she enters, leaving the door open behind
her. CAMERA PULLS BACK AND AWAY and we now see the room as
Lila sees it.
It is ornate, damask-and-mahogany, thick and warm and ripe,
an olla podrida of mismated furnishings and bric-a-brac of
the last century. The bed is four poster, but uncanoped; the
dressing table is fancy and flounced with satin; there is a
great chiffonier, a big-doored wardrobe, a large, oval, full-
length pier-glass (this against the wall directly opposite
the door), a satin recamier, an upholstered armchair by the
window, a white marble fireplace, its grate cold but piled
with ashes.
And there is in the room an unmistakably live quality, as if
even though it is presently unoccupied, it has not been long
vacated by some musty presence.
Lila glances at the bed. The damask coverlet is thrown over
it, but it is not neat, there is the imprint of a body on
it, a body which obviously has slept in a curled-up, womb-
like position. Lila stares at it for a moment, up, then goes
to the dressing table. Its top is scattered with boxes and
jars of cosmetics and creams, traces of fresh powder, an
opened bottle or perfume, a comb, and a brush with traces of
hair in its bristles. Lila moves on, catches a glimpse of
herself in the pier-glass, is startled, turns away, goes to
the chiffonier, is about to open a drawer, sees the high
wardrobe out of the corner of her eyes, goes to it,
hesitantly. She opens one door. Fresh, clean, well pressed
dresses hang neatly. Lila opens the other door. The sweaters
and dresses and robes hang freely, none in moth-proof, storage-
type bags. There is even a well-brushed collar of foxes.
Along the floor of the wardrobe is a line of clean, polished
shoes. Lila stares, then closes the door, turns, looks once

dismay. The room is grotesque, a horrible, ludicrous fantasy
of childhood held beyond the point of decency.
It is a small room. The walls are fancied with romping
silhouettes of teddy-bears and sailboats and carousels and
fat cows jumping over aghast moons. The bed is small, far
too short for a man of Norman's height. And yet the rumpled
covers indicate that it is in this bed that Norman sleeps.
Next to the bed is an old-fashioned toy chest. On its top
there are a bird-in-a-cage lamp, a plain-bound book, and an
ash tray filled with ashes and cigarette stubs. A grown man's
shirt hangs on a child's clothes tree.
Against one wall there is a narrow, high bookcase filled
with thick, unchildish-looking books. On the small, white
chest of drawers there is an old, child's victrola. The record
on the turntable is discovered, on close inspection, to be
Beethoven's Eroica Symphony.
Lila studies the room, fascinated and repelled. She glances
at the bookcase, comes into the room, goes to the bookcase
and pulls out a thick, large, plain-bound book. She opens
it. Her eyes go wide in shock. And then there is disgust.
She slams the book closed, drops it."|stage direction|||

there.
Norman enters the hallway, closes the door softly, listens.
He glances once in the direction of the basement stairs. He
seems about to smile, when suddenly all expression vanishes

state. He crosses to the stairway, goes up.
Lila remains crouched on the basement stairs, listening to
the SOUNDS of Norman. His footsteps on the stairs followed
by the fast noises of doors opening, of fast moving about an
upstairs room. Convinced that he is searching the upstairs
for her, she decides to chance an escape. She starts up the
steps, is about to turn into the hallway when her eye is
caught by a glimmer of light down in the basement. She pauses,
looks down, sees the crack of light coming from behind the
not entirely closed door to the fruit cellar. The swift moving
SOUNDS of Norman continue to come from upstairs.
Lila is torn, knows she should get out of the house while
she has the chance, is unable to resist the impulse to check

woman long dead. The skin is dry and pulled away from the
mouth and the teeth are revealed as in the skeleton's smile.
The eyes are gone from their sockets, the bridge of the nose
has collapsed, the hair is dry and wild, the cheeks are
sunken, the leathery-brown skin is powdered and rouged and
flaky. The body is dressed in a high-neck, clean, well-pressed
dress, obviously recently laundered and hand-ironed.
The movement of this stuffed, ill-preserved cadaver, turning
as if in response to Lila's call and touch, is actually
graceful, ballet-like, and the effect is terrible and obscene.

1619|SIMON|"He was already dangerously disturbed,
had been ever since his father died.
His mother was a clinging, demanding
woman... and for years the two of
them lived as if there was no one
else in the world. Then she met a
man and it seemed to Norman she ""threw
him over"" for this man. That pushed
him over the thin line... and he
killed them both. Matricide is
probably the most unbearable crime
of all... and most unbearable to the
son who commit it. So he had to erase
the crime, at least in his own mind."|speech|SIMON|?|True

1621|SIMON|"He stole her corpse... and a weighted
coffin was buried. He hid the body
in the fruit cellar, even ""treated""
it to keep it as well as it would
keep. And that still wasn't enough.
She was there, but she was a corpse.
So he began to think and speak for
her, gave her half his life, so to
speak. At times he could be both
personalities, carry on
conversations... at other times, the
mother-half took over completely. He
was never all Norman, but he was
often only mother. And because he
was so pathologically jealous of
her, he assumed she was as jealous
of him. Therefore, if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman, the
mother side of him would go wild."|speech|SIMON|?|True

1623|SIMON|"When Norman met your sister, he was
touched by her... and aroused by
her. He wanted her. And this set off
his ""jealous mother"" and...  ""mother
killed the girl."" After the murder,
Norman returned as if from a deep
sleep... and like a dutiful son,
covered up all traces of the crime
he was convinced his mother had
committed."|speech|SIMON|?|True

1626|SIMON|"Not exactly. A man who dresses in
woman's clothing in order to achieve
a sexual change... or satisfaction...
is a transvestite.  But in Norman's
case, he was simply doing everything
possible to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive. And
whenever reality came too close,
when danger or desire threatened
that illusion, he'd dress up, even
to a cheap wig he brought, and he'd
walk about the house, sit in her
chair, speak in her voice... He tried
to be his mother."|speech|SIMON|?|True

got the story from the mother. She
thinks Norman has been taken away...
because of his crimes.  She insists
she did nothing, that Norman committed
all the murders just to keep her
from being discovered. She even smiled
a bit coquettishly as she said that.
Of course, she feels badly about
it... but also somewhat relieved to
be, as she put it, free of Norman,
at last."|speech|SIMON|?|True

There is no furniture except the straight-back chair in which
Norman sits, in the center of the room. The room has a quality
of no-whereness, of calm separation from the world.
The Police Guard has placed the blanket on Norman's knees.
Norman, as we come upon him, is lifting the blanket, unfolding
it. His face, although without makeup and without the
surrounding softness of the wig, has a certain femininity
about it, a softness about the mouth and a kind of arch
womanliness about the brows.
Calmly, Norman places the blanket about his shoulders, as if
it were a cashmere shawl. CAMERA REMAINS in a position so
that our view of Norman is a FULL ONE. When the shawl is in
position, and Norman is settled, we HEAR, OVER SHOT, the
voice of his mother, coming from the calm of his thoughts."|stage direction|||
