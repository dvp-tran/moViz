'Hair down to their ears and parted in the middle-- little
versions of Kurt Cobain or Jord Catalano.
They are staring at a group of dancing girls - In the middle

remember this for later. Katie continues to bounce- One boy

fat kid, there's Emma. She's an awkward 12. Wearing borrowed
clothes- a skirt that's a little too long, a top that she
can't fill out. She's taller than any of the boys. But
