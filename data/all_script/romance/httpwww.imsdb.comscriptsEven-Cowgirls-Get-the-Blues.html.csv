1||INT. CAVE NIGHT|location
2||"There is a huge ancient hourglass made of animal skins, and
acorns plop through the waist of the hourglass one by one.
It sits in a pool of water. In the water swim EYELESS CATFISH
in geometric patterns. An underground stream feeds the pool
of water and then flows into a huge underground crevasse
that on occasion emits a LOW RUMBLE.
INDIANS with torches surround the hourglass, which now we
can see is in a cave. And as soon as the acorns have finished
passing through the hourglass, a crew of Indians turn it on
its opposite end. One of the Indians appears to be JAPANESE.
ONE INDIAN stands at the wall of the cavern in front of a
series of symbolic carvings and scratches, with stone in
hand he makes a few hatchmarks, and keeps an eye on the
CREVASSE.
THE CREVASSE RUMBLES once more, loosening a few chunks of
rock from the cave.
The earth begins to shake."|stage direction

very long neck. Another is a primitive drawing of a naked
girl, who has long flowing hair. She also has, pointed out
from her sides, thumbs that are three times normal human
proportions. A MUSICAL CHORUS sounds at the sight of this
drawing of a girl with the thumbs. The chartkeeper puts the
finishing touches on the drawing.
And the song ""Happy Birthday to You"" strikes up on country
and western guitar and polka-like accordion. title"|stage direction

42|MADAME ZOE|"Hmmm. I'd say that you have an
intelligent, kindly, somewhat artistic
nature. However, Sissy, however,
there is a heavy quality to the second
phalanx- the phalanx of logic --
that indicates a capacity for foolish
or clownish behavior, a refusal to
accept responsibility or to take
things seriously and bent to be
disrespectful of those who do. Your
mama tells me that you're pretty
well behaved and shy, but I'd watch
out for signs of irrationality. All

150|THE COUNTESS|"Shit O dear, that's enough to make
me asthmatic. The nerve of those
twits. What do they know about female
odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my
concept. My ranch out West? It's a
beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few
head of cattle for atmosphere and
tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch,
a place where unhappy women --
divorcees and widows, mainly -- can
go to lose weight, remove wrinkles,
change their hair styles and pretty
themselves up for the next
disappointment. My ranch is named
the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber
Rose douche bag, my own invention,
and bless its little red bladder,
the most popular douche bag in the
world. So get this. It's on the
migratory flight path of the whooping
cranes. The last flock of wild
whooping cranes left in existence.
Well, these cranes stop off at my
little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's
called -- twice a year, autumn and
spring, and spend a few days each
time, resting up, eating, doing
whatever whooping cranes do. I've
never seen them, understand, but I
hear they're magnificent. Very big
specimens -- I mean, huge mothers --
and white as snow, to coin a phrase,
except for black tips on their wings
and tail feathers, and bright red
heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case
you didn't know it, are noted for
their mating dance. It's just the
wildest show in nature.
It's probably the reason why
birdwatching used to be so popular
with old maids and deacons. Picture
these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds
in full dance -- leaping six feet
off the mud, arching their backs,
flapping their wings, strutting low
to the ground. Dears, it's
overwhelming. And picture the birds
doing their sex dance on TV. Right
there on the home screen, creation's
most elaborate sex ritual -- yet
clean and pure enough to suit the
Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in
the foreground. In a white gown, red
hood attached, and big feathery
sleeves trimmed in black. In a very
subdued imitation of the female
whooping crane, she dance/walks over
to a large nest in which there sits
a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew.
Off-camera, a string quartet is
playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is
reading a few poetic lines about
courtship and love. Are you starting
to get it? Doesn't it make the hair
on your neck stand up and applaud?
My very goodness gracious! Grandiose,
lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout-
oriented; you can't top it. I've
hired a crew of experts from Walt
Disney Studios, the best wildlife
cinematographers around. You're my
eternal favorite. Princess Grace
herself couldn't be better, not even
if she had your personality which
she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out

154|SISSY|But Countess...|speech
155|THE COUNTESS|"Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I
realize that you've always avoided
all but the most rudimentary
involvements with men, and I might
add, you've been wise. Heterosexual
relationships seem to lead only to
marriage. For men, marriage is a
matter of efficient logistics: The
male gets his food, bed, laundry,
TV, pussy, offspring and creature
comforts all under one roof, where
he doesn't have to dissipate his
psychic energy thinking about them
too much, then he is free to go out
and fight the battles of life, which
is what existence is all about. But
for a woman marriage is surrender."|speech

afraid of me, I think..."|speech
159|THE COUNTESS|"Yes, well, what I'm getting at is
that there comes a time when it is
psychologically impossible for a
woman to lose her virginity. She
can't wait too long, you know. Now,
there's no reason why you must lose
yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit,
that's all."|speech

being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of
Fame in Oklahoma City there are just
two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em

Chink taught me something about
cowgirls. Did you realize that
cowgirls have been around for many
centuries? Long before America. In
ancient India the care of the cattle
was always left up to young women
they called gopis. Being alone with
the cows all the time, the gopis got
awfully horny, just like we do here.
Every gopi was in love with Krishna,
a good-looking young god who played
the flute like it was going out of
style When the moon was full, this
Krishna would play his flute by a
river and call the gopis to him.
Then he would multiply himself sixteen
thousand times -- one for each gopi --
and make love to each one the way
she most desired. There they were,
sixteen thousand gopis balling Krishna
on the river bank, and the energy of
their merging was so great that it
created a huge oneness, a total union
of love, and it was God. Wow! Quite

to change drastically, and probably
in your lifetime. The Clock People
see calamitous earthquakes as the
agent of change, and they may be
right, since there are a hundred
thousand earthquakes a year and major
ones are long overdue. But there are
far worse catastrophes coming...
unless the human race can bring itself
to abandon the goals and values of
civilization, in other words, unless
it can break the consumption habit --
and we are so conditioned to consuming
as a way of life that for most of us
life would have no meaning without
the yearnings and rewards of
progressive consumption. It isn't
merely that our bad habits will cause
global catastrophes, but that our
operative political-economic
philosophies have us in such a blind
crab grip that they prevent us from
preparing for the natural disasters
that are not our fault. So the
apocalyptic shit is going to hit the
fan, all right, but there'll be some
of us it'll miss. Little pockets of
humanity. Like the Clock People.
Like you two honeys, if you decide
to accept my offer of a lease on
Siwash Cave. There's almost no
worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear
accident, plague, weather warfare or

children with your characteristics.
All in Siwash Cave. In a
postcatastrophe world, your offspring
would of necessity intermarry, forming
in time a tribe. A tribe every member
of which had giant thumbs. A tribe
of Big Thumbs would relate to the
environment in very special ways. It
could not use weapons or produce
sophisticated tools. It would have
to rely on its wits and its senses.
It would have to live with animals --
and plants! -- as virtual equals.
It's extremely pleasant to me to
think about a tribe of physical
eccentrics living peacefully with
animals and plants, learning their
languages, perhaps, and paying them
the respect they deserve."|speech
