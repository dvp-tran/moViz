1||EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT|location|||
2||"A HOMELESS MAN, who from his tatty suit may have been a top
broker this time last year, is picking through a bin in
Manhattan's deserted night-time financial district.
The street starts to vibrate. A TERRIFYING GROWL approaches.
A huge black shape smashes into view - THE DARK KNIGHT'S
BATMOBILE! Our audience wonder if they've wandered into the
wrong movie. The Homeless Man dives for cover.
BAM! The Batmobile smashes into a row of parked cars.
We hear manic laughing from inside the car, which screeches
and careers violently into a sign reading `WALL STREET'.
Sirens herald THREE POLICE CARS in hot pursuit.
The Batmobile roars up Wall Street, bashing against the New
York Stock Exchange, thumping up and down the Federal Hall's
steps and finally smashing at high speed into the rear end of
the famous 'Charging Bull' statue. Two enormous bronze
testicles thud onto the Batmobile's bonnet and roll away.
The cop cars screech up, surrounding the Batmobile. TWO OLDER
COPS and A ROOKIE surround it, weapons drawn.
A HELICOPTER appears, blazing the Batmobile in white light."|stage direction|||

bull teeters, a little scarily. He stands, wobbly. His Batman
utility belt features a big water pistol, a firework, a hip

stapler. The younger cop is desperately fighting the giggles."|stage direction|||
