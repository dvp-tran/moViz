swirling hole and over to the jars, it passes through them

thread, calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the SCREAMING
Priests, who are going insane from the procedure.
A red hot POKER is pulled out of a pit of burning coals.
A Priest's head is wedged between two strong boards. His
eyes widen in terror as an Embalmer moves to insert the red
hot poker up his nose.
But just before he does, WE QUICKLY CUT TO IMHOTEP'S FACE,
horrified, as OFF CAMERA, the Priest SCREAMS.
WE GO WIDE on the chamber. All twenty-one of Imhotep's Priests
squirm inside their wrappings. Imhotep is forced to his knees.
His arms are held back. His mouth is pried open."|stage direction

TONGUE out of his mouth, then places a very sharp knife on

apparently cut out. The Embalmer flings Imhotep's tongue
onto the floor. The Mumia's dogs attack and quickly eat it.
Imhotep is WRAPPED ALIVE. Only his mouth, nostrils and
fearfilled eyes are left free of the slimy bandages. Detritus
muck boils inside a black cauldron. Embalmers scoop out the
fetid muck and apply it to Imhotep's wrappings as he squirms.
He's then laid in a wooden COFFIN inside a stone SARCOPHAGUS.
An Embalmer with a BUCKET steps up and looks into the coffin.
Imhotep's wild eyes stare back. The Embalmer empties the
bucket over Imhotep's chest: dozens of SCARABS, disgusting
dung beetles. They scurry across Imhotep's SCREAMING face.
Some vanish into his tongue-less mouth and up his nostrils."|stage direction

across the aisle with the Tuthmosis book. It's a little too
far, so she stretches, reaching, holding the top of the ladder
with her fingertips, she's almost got it, closer now closer.
And that's when the ladder pulls away from the shelf. Evelyn
YELPS, flings the Tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the

chamber. Evelyn skids to a stop. Looks in wonder at all the
treasure. SAND rains down on them. O'Connell grabs her again
and quickly pulls her through the mounds of treasure towards
a SINKING DOORWAY on the far side of the room. The SOUND of
the sinking walls is deafening.
Beni crouch-runs into the treasure chamber. O'Connell, Evelyn
and Jonathan race past him. He joins them as they run up a
staircase. Heading for a DESCENDING DOORWAY, which is already
half gone, it's now only four feet high -- now three feet
high -- now two feet. Jonathan dives through the narrow gap.
Then O'Connell dives through, he spins around. Evelyn dives,
but gets stuck in the middle, about to get cut in half.
O'Connell grabs her arm and YANKS her through in the nick of
time. Beni reaches through the narrowing gap with his hand --"|stage direction

back just as the top of the door CRASHES to the floor.
Sealing him in. Beni quickly crawls back down the stairs as
the ceiling SLAMS down behind him. He stands up and looks
around with his diminishing torch.
All the doorways FINISH CLOSING. There's no way out. He's
trapped. And then he hears something, and turns around. Over
in the corner, a scarab-beetle stares at him, CHITTERING.
Beni waves his flickering torch at the scarab and backs away."|stage direction

upon dozens of scarabs boil up out of the floor around him.
Beni is absolutely terrified. The scarabs start to move in.
And that's when Beni's torch goes out. PITCH BLACK. A BEAT.
And then we hear Beni start SCREAMING in horror and pain.
