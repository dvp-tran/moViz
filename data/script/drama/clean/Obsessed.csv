As she's about to fall, Lisa reaches out and grabs the
chandelier with both hands.
By a miracle, it supports her and she swings back and forth
like a human pendulum but now the chandelier is beginning to
pull loose from it's ceiling mount. Plaster cracks and rips
away.
Lisa swings back and forth, dangling.
Beth stands on the landing. She looks at terrified Lisa,
then up at the ceiling mount. It won't take Lisa's weight
much longer.
And both women know it.
Lisa hangs by one hand, reaching out with her other hand to
Beth who could pull her to safety."|stage direction|||

With a look of horror on her face, Lisa falls through space.
The soundtrack goes dead silent as we go into slow motion.
Down, down, down Lisa falls. Her arms and legs flop around
like a marionette with its strings cut, clawing the air.
The fall seems endless.
Then... Lisa hits the glass dining table with her back.    Her
whole body buckles. The surface of the table ripples.
In slow mo, the glass shatters and explodes around Lisa,
framing her entire body, forming a halo around her head.
Sound returns -- the sound of breaking glass -- and it's
deafening.
The table gives way and Lisa lands hard on the marble floor,
her skull cracking. Her back is probably broken but she's
still conscious."|stage direction|||
