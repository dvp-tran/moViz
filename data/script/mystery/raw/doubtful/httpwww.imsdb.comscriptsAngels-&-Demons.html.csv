CLOSE ON an ornate ring.     It's intricately carved with a seal, an
image of St. Peter casting a net.     The ring is carried on a satin
pillow through a darkened, regal apartment.     In the distance,
BELLS ARE TOLLING   -- the slow, solemn tones that announce a death.
A dozen men in scarlet cassocks, ROMAN CATHOLIC CARDINALS, bend
down to inspect the ring, nodding in affirmation, part of an
ancient ritual.
A younger man (the CAMERLENGO) in a black cassock takes a silver
knife and scratches the ring's seal twice, once horizontally and
once vertically, in the sign of the cross.
Now the ring is placed on a lead block.    The Camerlengo raises a
silver mallet and SMASHES it down, shattering the ring into a
thousand tiny pieces.
As the Cardinals confirm to their satisfaction that the ring has
been destroyed, the HUSHED VOICE of a NEWS REPORTER comes over the
image."|stage direction

there's a faint HISSING sound coming from the bullethole, and he
goes to it and takes a deep breath of air from the outside.

Seized by an idea, he looks up at the wall, at its four corners,

made in the center.

right, not quite as high, lower middle-left, and the very lower
right corner.
Now there are four new holes, each HISSING slightly, and the first
hole, in the center.

Two gunshots THUD into the chests of Vatican Cops 2 & 3, who were
supporting the pew.    They fall, the pew tips --

The Cardinal falls toward the flames. Vatican Cop 4 tries to pull
him to safety, but doesn't have enough of WHIRRS through the
pulley until it reaches its the Cardinal to an abrupt stop, six
feet lower

His SHRIEK of agony echoes through the burning church.
Langdon SLAMS to the floor just at the edge of the burning church
pews, maybe CRACKING a rib on the hard floor of the church.

Mr. Gray stands over him,     implacable.
FROM A DISTANCE,
we see Mr. Gray fire two shots into the ground where Cop 4 is
lying.
Then he turns toward us.
NEARBY,
Langdon, still on the ground, looks up at the sound of the shots.
Through the burning church pews he can see Mr. Gray, starting
toward him.
Langdon crawls, on all fours, through the outskirts of the
bonfire, toward a recessed part of the wall ten or fifteen feet
away.
Mr. Gray steps up behind him, raises his gun           --"|stage direction
1141||"VOICE   (O.S.)

They drop, dead, but one of them squeezes off a single round
before falling.
Mr. Gray looks down, at his right shoulder, where a dark red stain
is spreading on his suit.    He touches it, more annoyed than
anything.
UNDERNEATH THE BURNING PEWS,
Langdon has crawled as close as he dares to the raging fire, and
the sleeve of his shirt is ablaze.    He rolls out the other side
of the embers, stamping out the flames, gets to his feet, and
takes off running.
Mr. Gray pursues, only slowing his gait slightly to DOUBLE TAP two
shots into the head of a dying Vatican Cop.
ACROSS THE CHURCH,
Langdon hurls himself over a balustrade and into a chapel on the
far side of the church.    Bullets SHATTER the glass of an
elevated crypt, three feet off the floor.    (Inside is a superbly
detailed wax statue of a saint in death.)
Langdon dives under it and crawls backwards, staring in horror at
Mr. Gray's feet as they approach the chapel from across the
church.
Langdon's back THUDS into a wall.
Dead end.
But there's an old wooden grating in the wall.   He turns, KICKS
it with both feet.
The grating CRUNCHES into pieces, revealing a narrow crawlspace
IN THE CRAWL SPACE,
Langdon army-crawls through it.
Mr. Gray's face appears in the entry to the crypt.    He pauses to
change clips on his handgun --

The Cardinal rolls, falling into the fountain with an enormous
SPLASH.    His weighted body sinks immediately to the bottom.
There is a moment, frozen in time, in which Langdon locks eyes
with Mr. Gray, still hunched in the back of the van as the clock
tower continues to BONG, the only sound we can hear.
Langdon looks at him, then down at the body in the fountain, then
back up at Mr. Gray--
-- who salutes him ---
-- the van door SLAMS shut, and the van tears ass out of there.
Langdon looks from its receding taillights to the idling police
car, its door hanging open, he could jump in and give chase, but
then his eyes go back to the fountain, where the drowning cardinal
must not have much time left, and it's really no decision at all.
Langdon covers the distance to the fountain in two quick strides
and leaps in.
IN THE FOUNTAIN,
the water is waist deep and like ice.    Steady streams of bubbles
rise up from the bottom, churning it.
Langdon reaches the body of the Cardinal, plunges in   --
UNDERWATER,

Inside the papal apartments, Robert Langdon sits stiffly on a
straight-backed chair in a hallway.    Couldn't look more
uncomfortable if he tried.
A Swiss Guardsman stands on either side of him.
The door to his right suddenly opens, another Guardsman nods to
him, and Langdon gets to his feet, straightening his jacket.
INT     OFFICE OF THE POPE DAY
Langdon is shown into the office, where a robed figure is being
dressed by two VATICAN ATTENDANTS -- the clothes he dons are
unmistakably papal vestments.    The figure, his back to us,
gestures to a nearby table.
One of the Swiss Guardsmen goes to the table and picks up an
envelope, hands it to Langdon."|stage direction
