what I was driving that day. I've
owned a lot of cars. Different
kinds. Lots of different kinds of
cars. She was standing, this girl,
on the side of the street where
there was a chicken stand; not the
Colonel, mind you, but nevertheless
a chicken stand, and I pulled the
Mercury over and rolled down the
window by electric power. She was
wearing a leather skirt and she had
a lot of hair on her arms. I like
that. I like it a lot. It means a
big bush. I like a big bush. She
said, ""Are you dating?"" I said,
""yes,"" and she got in the car. We
pulled to a remote location, one
that she and I both felt
comfortable with and she said, ""How
much can you spend?"" I said, ""What
it takes to see your bush. I know
it's a big one."" She said ""twenty
five dollars,"" which to a working
man is not chicken feed. I produced
the money and she put it in her
shoe and pulled up her skirt. There
before me lay a thin, crooked,
uncircumcised penis. You can
imagine how badly I wanted my
twenty-five dollars back."|speech|CHARLES|M

across so often in life. I'm sure
you've run across them, that didn't
deserve the things he had. One of
those things was his beautiful
bride, Sarah. She was a Georgia
Peach. As a matter of fact she
looked more like the picture I've
had in my head than any woman I've
ever seen. I took it upon myself to
take her away from John Liggit
Hunter, who didn't deserve her. I'm
not sure if I mentioned that he was
a Frenchman who claimed to be an
Englishman. It took some very
strong nylon cord to take her away

my mother and father's house in a
little old shed and my daddy'd
built for me. They didn't too much
want me up there in the house with
the rest of 'em. I mostly just set
around out there in the shed all
the time a lookin' at the ground.

there."|speech|KARL|M

most of his life, not that I can

just set around the shed and
tinkered around with a lawn mower
or two and went to school off and
on from time to time but the
children there made quite a bit of
sport of me, made fun of me quite a
bit. Some of 'em roughed me up
sometimes so mostly I stayed out
back there in the shed. My daddy
worked down at the sawmill there,
down there at the planer mill for
an old man named Dixon.
Old man Dixon was a very cruel
feller, he didn't treat his
employees very well, didn't pay 'em
much of a wage, didn't pay my daddy
much of a wage, just barely enough
to get by on. But I reckon he got
by all right, they come out one or
the other of 'em, usually my
mother, and fed me pretty regular.
At least I know he made enough for
me to have mustard and biscuits
three or four times a week. Old man
Dixon had a boy named Jesse Dixon.
Jesse was really more cruel than
his daddy. He made quite a bit of
sport of me and takened advantage
of the little girls around the
neighborhood quite a bit."|speech|KARL|M

pretty woman. He said it quite a
bit from time to time, when I was
at the school house. Well, I reckon
you want me to get on and tell you
what happened so I reckon I'll tell
you. I was settin' out in the shed
one evenin' not doin' too much,
just kindly starin' at the wall and
a waitin' fer my mother to come out
and give me my Bible lesson and I
heared a commotion up in the house
there so I got up and run up on the
screened-in porch there to see what
was a goin' on, and I looked in the
kitchen window and I seen my mother
a layin' there on the floor without
any clothes on."|speech|KARL|M

111|KARL|"Well, I just seen red. I picked up
a kaiser blade that was a layin'
there by the screen door, some
folks calls it a sling blade, I
call it a kaiser blade. It's just a
long handle like a axe handle with
a long blade on it that's shaped
kind of like a banana. Sharp on one
edge and dull on the other. It's
what the highway boys use to cut
down weeds and whatnot.
I went in the kitchen there and I
hit Jesse Dixon up side the head
with it and knocked him off my
mother. I reckon that didn't quite
satisfy me so I hit him again in
the neck with the sharp edge and
just plumb near cut his head off.
Killed him. Well, my mother, she
jumped up from there and started
yellin', ""What did you kill Jesse
fer? What did you kill Jesse fer?"""|speech|KARL|M
112||(pause, intense breathing)|location||

didn't really mind what Jesse was a

call it a kaiser blade and hit my
mother up side the head with it an'
killed her."|speech|KARL|M

I would. Anyhow, they seen fit to
put me in here and here I've been
for a great long while. I've
learned to read some; took me four
years to read the Bible. I reckon I
understand a good deal of it. It
wasn't what I expected in a lot of
places. I've slept in a good bed
for a great long while. They've
seen fit to put me out now. They
tell me they're a settin' me free

Doyle, he's funny you know. Not
funny ha, ha, funny queer. He likes
to go with men instead of women.
That makes him not to be able to
fight too good. He sure is nice

who are queer can get along better
in a big town. He got transferred

will make your life hell. You're a

afraid, I guess, just taken aback.

didn't mean it like that. In a good

Baking the cookies of discontent
By the heat of a laundrymat vent
