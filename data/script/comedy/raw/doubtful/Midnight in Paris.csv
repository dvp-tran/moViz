I believe that love that's true and
real creates a respite from death.
All cowardice comes from not loving
or not loving well which is the
same thing and when the man who is
brave and true looks death squarely
in the face like some rhino hunters
I know or Belmonte who is truly
brave, it is because they love with
sufficient passion to push death
out of their minds till it returns
as it does to all men and then you
must make really good love again.

What do you mean?

I dropped in on you just the way we
dropped in on the 1890's.
ADRIANA
You did?
GIL
I wanted to escape my present just
like you wanted to escape yours.
To a golden age.
ADRIANA
Surely you don't think the twenties
are a golden age?
GIL
To me they are.
ADRIANA
But I'm from the twenties and I'm
tellin~ you the golden age is the
Belle Epoque.
GIL
Yes but don't you see - to these
guys the golden age was the
Renaissance. They'd all trade the
Belle Epoque to paint alongside
Michelangelo or Titian. And those
guys probably imagine life was
better when Kubla Khan was around.
I'm having an insight. A minor one
but that accounts for the anxiety
of my dream.

What dream?

Last night I dreamed I ran out of
zithromax - and then I went to the
dentist and there was no novacaine -

What are you talking about?
GIL
And even in the twenties - no
dishwashers - no 911 if your
appendix bursts - no ""movies on
demand"" ·
ADRIANA
But if we love each other what does
it matter when we live?
GIL
Because if you stay here and this
becomes your present, sooner or
later you'll imagine another time
was really the golden time. And so
will I - I'm beginning to see why
it can't work, Adriana. The
present has a hold on you because
it's your present and while there's
never any progress in the most
important things, you get to
appreciate - what little progress
is made - the internet - Pepto-
Bismol. The present is always
going to seem unsatisfying because
life itself is unsatisfying -
that's why Gauguin goes back and
forth between Paris and Tahiti,
searching - it's my job as a writer
to try and come up with reasons why
despite life being tragic and
unsatisfying, it's still worth it.
ADRIANA
That's the problem with writers -
you're all so full of words - but
I'm more emotional. I'm going to
stay and live in Paris' most
glorious time. You made a choice
to leave Paris once and you
regretted it.
GIL
Yes, that one I regretted but it
was a real choice and I made the
wrong one. This is a choice
between accepting reality or
surreal insanity.
