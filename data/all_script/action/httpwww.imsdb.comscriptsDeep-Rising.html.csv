barks one-word questions to his JAPANESE CREW. The Sailors
work the consoles and give clipped monosyllabic answers. The
JAPANESE SCIENCE OFFICERS go over charts on the electronic
position board, a contiuously-shifting graphic representation
of the ocean contours below. Behind them is an elaborate
DEPTH GAUGE with computerized graphics. READ: 34,000 feet and
dropping. The Crew works at a fevered pitch. An ALARM SOUNDS
as the depth gauge sounds 35,000 feet. All eyes on the depth

leaking toxic waste, radioactive waste, dumped in the depths,
away from prying eyes, and populated areas. The vessel drops
into the SULU BASIN. Imagine the Grand Canyon under forty
thousand feet of water.
But the Sulu Basin is ten times the size of the Grand Canyon.
Down here, ten thousand fathoms below the storm, all is calm.
The dual TURBO-PROPS on the ear of the submersible KICK ON.
The Bathysaphe is now mobile. It glides down the side of an
enormous rock face, carefully avoiding massive sandstone
pinnacles which jut up from the ocean floor far below."|stage direction

ARM extends out from under the plexi-dome. Its ""hand"" is a
high-tech LASER CUTTER. It approaches the plate, steadies,
then fires a direct BLUE BEAM at the bedrock, burns the rock
into magma and cuts a perfect round pattern.
Another ROBOTIC ARM reaches forward, its CLAW rips out the
cut rock from inside the pattern, then takes the sample and
sets it inside a hydro-basket on the submersible's port side."|stage direction

dome and out into the freezing, cobalt blue of the PALAWAN
TROUGH. The MUSIC intensifies as they round each curve. Then,
dead ahead, is the end of the trough, which is half-blocked
by a rock-encrusted embankment.
The MUSIC builds.
The Shinkai approaches the embankment. Slowly starts to glide
up the side. The Captain and Science Officers seem mesmerized
by all the lonely creepiness. They crest the embankment. And
the plexi-domed VIEW FILLS with an unimaginable horror.
As far as the eye can see, the entire murky landscape is
filled with WHALE BONES. A valley of death. Cluttered here
and there, carelessly flung about, are the rusting hulks of
several ships. Seemingly ripped apart. Clusters of shark
cartilage float through the water like white ghosts.
The Captain, the Science Officers and the entire Crew just
stare, frozen in place by the strange horror before them."|stage direction

staring at the position board, which shows a large section of
the OCEAN FLOOR STARTING TO MOVE, its contours incongruous
with the rest of the graphic representation.
The Science Officers look stunned. The Captain barks
commands. The Crew leaps into high gear.
Then the Captain reverses the trottle, and petal-to-the-metal
he starts to back out.
The inky blood swirls past the plexi-dome. Then suddenly, and
impossibly, the SUBMERSIBLE JERKS TO A HALT. Everybody goes
ass-over-teacups. EQUIPMENT SHATTERS. SPARKS FLY. GLASS
BREAKS. Lots of YELLING in Japanese.
The SHINKAI starts to ROCK and SHAKE. Something has a hold on
it. More EQUIPMENT SHATTERS. Men are thrown about. Then it
stops rocking. The Sailors stop yelling. Everything goes dead
quiet. Frightened eyes share terror-filled looks. A SOUND is
HEARD coming from the exterior of the ship, like feet runing
across the outside of the hull. Very creepy.
The HULL starts to MOAN and CREAK from an UNSEEN PRESSURE.
And then the sub begins to be crushed like it's a beer can.
The metal HULL TORQUES on all sides. RIVETS POP and SNAP.
WATER SPRAYS and SHOOTS. More SPARKS FLY. The STEEL PLATING
DIMPLES, CRUMBLES and SCREAMS in agony. CHAOS. PANDEMONIUM.

Just missing them as it SLAMS into a wall.
Finnegan falls onto the catwalk, drops his rifle, unarmed.
Trillian, freaked, stumbles back and lands on her butt.
Finnegan sits up against the walls, turns and looks --
The TENTACLE slowly SQUIRMS across the wall like a big leach.
Trying to find its prey. Finnegan is frozen in place.
Watching. Trillian sits up, eyes widening in fear as she sees
-- Hideous little worm-like FEELERS and SUCKERS protrude up
and down the Tentacle. WRIGGLING and WRITHING and feeling
their way across the wall. Getting closer and closer to
Finnegan.
Finnegan's eyes go to his pulse-rifle close to Trillian's
feet. He motions for her to push it toward him. But, frozen
in fear, she can only watch the slithering horror before her.
Tongue-like, the Feelers lick their way across the oily wall.
FINNEGAN DUCKS as they squirm over his head. Then he BRUSHES
against some dirt, making a SCRAPING SOUND.
A Feeler quickly drops down and touches Finnegan's arm. He
leaps to his feet. So does Trillian. She grabs the rifle,
turns and bolts off down the dark alley. Finnegan tries to
run, but the Feelers hold him tight. Two more Feelers slap
onto his arm. HE YELLS.
The Creature starts reeling him in.
ANGLE ON: Trillian, running. Finnegan's YELL reaches her. She
stops cold. Looking back the way she came, torn.
ANGLE ON: Finnegan, fighting for all he is worth, being
reeled into the mass of machinery by the tentacle.
When...out of the darkness, Trillian suddenly comes running
back. Panting hard, she aims the gun."|stage direction

the TENTACLE. HARD. RIPPING into its flesh. It SQUIRTS ink
blood, releases Finnegan and recoils.
Finnegan drops to his knees. Grabbing his arm, in pain. The
tentacle recovers and starts coming toward him again.
Trillian grabs him, and with all her strength, jerks him to
his feet, and starts to drag him backward. The tentacle
coils, ready to strike. Just before it does so, Finnegan
grabs the rifle with his one good arm, flips the safety, and
fires, blasting the tentacle to pieces."|stage direction

soul-wrenching nightmare. The CREATURES' NEST -- OR STOMACH.
Across a small portion of the ship's midsection, is a huge
GELATINOUS WOMB. Imagine a massive thick wall of clear-yellow
JELL-O, with hundreds of BLUE VEINS running through it.
If it weren't all so horrific, it would be considered
beautiful. Inside the womb, A DOZEN HUMANS, passengers, float
around in some kind of twisted embryonic state, the living
dead. They all seem to be breathing the gelatin. Several
TENTACLES WRIGGLE through the stuff; which divides and re
forms in some sort of strange mitosis.
Finnegan and the others look at the passengers, horrified.
But even more horrifying is that the people can look back at
them. Many start to reach out, seemingly in slow motion as
their hands ooze through the thick gelatin. Trillian looks

Twenty-five meters away from hitting the Fuji Maru. No twenty
meters away. Now fifteen.
Finnegan pops to the surface. Looks around. Can't find
Trillian. He DIVES under the water. His POV: Tentacles
converging on him from the murky depths. The ""retrieve""
feature that's on all jet skis forces it back around towards
where Finnegan and Trillian fell off. Finnegan BURST to the
surface. Holding Trillian. She looks nearly lifeless. The jet
ski heads right at them. Finnegan swims for it. Dragging
Trillian. As tentacles converge from all sides.
The JET SKI is suddenly SUCKED under the water! Swallowed
whole. Finnegan quickly reverses. Backstrokes like mad. The
WARHEAD SLICES through the water. Now only ten meters away
from hitting the Fuji Maru.
Now nine meters away. Now eight. Seven. Six. Five."|stage direction

1459||"Finnegan paddles hard. Sucking in as much water as he is air.
A TENTACLE RISES UP out of the water. Looms above Finnegan
and Trillian. Dripping water. About to strike. There's
nowhere to hide. Finnegan paddles harder."|stage direction

1461||"The TENTACLE starts its DOWNWARD LUNGE. And that's when the
SAIPAN RAMS the Fuji Maru. The WARHEAD SLAMS into its hull.
BA-WHOOOOOOMMM!!
The SAIPAN EVAPORATES.
METAL FLIES.
WATER SPRAYS.
FIRE FILLS the night sky. The TOP DECK of the Fuji Maru
CARTWHEELS across the waves. The Tentacle above Finnegan
drops like lead. And just lies there. Quivering. Another
EXPLOSION. LIFTS the remains of the FUJI MARU out of the sea.
Sends shock waves across the water.
Blows Finnegan's hair back. He swims on. Towards the island.
Pulling Trillian. The remains of the SAIPAN and the FUJI MARU
SMOLDER and SINK. BUBBLES EXPLODE to the surface.
A couple dozen small FIRES dot the waves. WATER SIZZLES and
STEAMS. SMOKE drifts into the night sky. Debris coats the
water."|stage direction

1463||"Finnegan and Trillian crawl out of the water and up onto the
beach of the island.
They collapse next to each other. Finnegan is exhausted.
Trillian coughs up seawater. They both turn and look out to
sea, and the rising sun. Trillian reaches into her bra, and
pulls out the egg sized diamond. She holds it up. The sun
refracts off it brilliantly...
Trillian looks at the diamond, looks around at the picture
perfect island, the picture perfect sunset...and then she
heaves it as far as she can into the sea. For the first time
since they know each other there is nobody around. No people.
No tentacles. And when they look at each other, something
else comes to mind besides survival.
Finnegan moves towards Trillian. Trillian moves towards
Finnegan. Their lips move closer, closer...
And then, down by their feet -- SOMETHING EXPLODES OUT OF THE
WATER! Scares the shit out of them. The audience too.
But it's just Pantucci. Looking waterlogged and shell-
shocked. Coughing up half the sea. Finnegan and Trillian help
him to his feet."|stage direction

1471||"And then they head the most gut-wrenching, spine-tingling,
teeth- shattering ROAR ever. Pure primeval. Like no sound or
animal or thing we've ever hear beofre. Coming from DEEP
WITHIN THE ISLAND."|stage direction

1473||"Finnegan, Trillian, and Pantucci slowly turn and look INLAND.
We BEGIN TO PULL BACK as they all stand up. MORE STRANGE
NOISES ARE HEARD. FROM MULTIPLE UNKNOWN SPECIES.
WE KEEP PULLING BACK. REVEALING more of this creepy-looking
island. And leaving our three heroes stranded on the beach.
WE KEEP PULLING BACK. REVEALING pieces of the smoldering
ship. Nearly the whole island is VISIBLE now. Dark jungles.
Craggy mountains. Maybe the scariest-looking place on earth."|stage direction
