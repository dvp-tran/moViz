And then your mommy said, ""Just do it,
already,"" which was very confusing to
Daddy. So I listened to the most
literal translation of that and I just
did it, already. What would you do?
Don't tell Mommy, but it was the
smartest thing I ever did, listening
to her, because now you're here. Isn't
that nice? I think it is."|speech|BEN|M
