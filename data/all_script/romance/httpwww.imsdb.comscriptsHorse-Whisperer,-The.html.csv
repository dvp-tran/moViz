Camera is POV, as if on the horse, riding through the

experience of sense of wild, exhilarating freedom.

magazine. She turns on the light, revealing a large row of
stalls and glassed in private offices. Everywhere we look, we
see indications of the kind of magazine she edits.
She strolls to her office -- the largest -- surrounded by
windows. The office walls are covered with photos, most of
which are COVER STORIES ON ANNIE.
(One photo is of Annie's father MARTIN. A BRITISH AMBASSADOR
with his young daughter on his lap, her arms affectionately
around his neck. Her mother stands right behind them, posing
like a member of the royal family.)

a family portrait, taken when Annie was given the Crystal

Hand Held Camera captures the energy of the room as it
follows overlapping lines, laughter, etc... yet, no matter how
casual it all seems, Annie is very much at the center of
control... We enter the scene of LAUGHTER, as Annie asks

wouldn't talk to the press and he's
libeled me by saying I faked the figures.
You're not going soft on me, are you?"|speech
111||"Silence. Gottschalk doesn't immediately respond. Everyone
waits. Covert looks between characters suggest this is
interesting -- has Annie over-stepped her bounds with the
magazine's owner? Annie waits without a shred of anxiety --

135||"Grace, directly behind Judith, tries to turn Pilgrim to avoid
being hit by the errant horse.
What follows, we see from Grace's perspective. The details
that form the images and sounds of Grace's mind are fast,
disembodies, almost surreal as --
Judith's horse bulldozes into Pilgrim, taking his legs out
from under him, sending both horses careening down the icy
slope. Grace hangs onto Pilgrim's neck. Judith, her leg
helplessly tangled in the stirrup, is dragged, her head
bouncing on the frozen ground.
They slide all the way back down to the COUNTRY ROAD. Pilgrim
is the first to find his legs and stand. Grace manages to sit
up in the saddle. She sees Judith's horse stumbling back onto
its feet, one of his legs broken at the ankles, walking in
confused circles, dragging Judith -- her face bleeding, her
leg hanging from the stirrup."|stage direction

139|JUDITH|I'm okay... I'm okay.|speech
140||"She tries to extricate her leg from the stirrup.
Grace sees it before she hears it. A GLINT off of steel. We
then hear the rumbling SOUND of a TRUCK coming around the
bend... The Girls on their horses in the middle of the road...
The Truck, an 18 wheeler carrying logging equipment, comes
around the turn... Grace grabs the bridle, trying to get
Judith's horse out of the road... The driver, seeing them, lays
on the air horn. The Horses bolt at the sound, the bridle
slipping out of Grace's hand..."|stage direction
141|GRACE|JUUDE!!!|speech
142||"... The horses turn apart. The Driver starts furiously
downshifting, trying to brake... He seems to get it under
control when suddenly THE TRUCK SKIDS on some ice. It begins
to slide, out of control, the truck bed and the cab jack-
knifing. The truck literally plows over the helpless Judith
and her horse -- the horse going down on the pavement, Judith
disappearing under him. The truck's cab, like a mythic
monster, heads right for Grace and Pilgrim... Grace looks
right into the Driver's helpless, frightened eyes... Suddenly,
Pilgrim rears up at the truck, sending Grace flying, bouncing
her off the pavement and under the wheel of the truck.
Pilgrim instinctively jumps onto the hood of the truck, his
hooves caught between the rear-view mirrors like some
grotesque ornament. His head and chest slams into the window,
shattering through the glass.
And then it is still.
The truck has stopped halfway in the road. Judith's horse
lies in the road, motionless. Pilgrim, on the truck's hood,
his legs splayed, stuck, his head and chest, bleeding. He
shrieks, struggling to get to his feet. He manages to free
his legs and, stepping off the cab onto the road, walks off,
wounded, in pain, into the sanctuary of the woods...
The Driver stumbles out of the cab, his head bleeding, in
shock. He sits on the ground. All we hear is the sound of the
river and the wind in the trees.
Grace, halfway under the truck, frozen, stares up at the
beautiful morning sky.
WE HEAR THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER..."|stage direction

standing up to his knees in the river. His chest is cut open,
bleeding. His face cut, contorted and swollen. LIZ HAMMOND,
the local veterinarian, hides a hypodermic needle in her
jacket, quietly walking into the water.
A Policeman is going into the water downstream from Pilgrim,
whose chest is heaving, blood drips into the water. He
watches Liz. She is almost to him when suddenly he bolts,
running upstream.
The Policeman behind him shouts and waves his arm. Frightened,
Pilgrim wheels back toward Liz, who manages to stick the hypo
in his neck. He rears, knocking her down, then runs out of
the river, the hypo still in his neck. He runs for the
sanctuary of the woods."|stage direction

beautiful countryside but Annie is focused on an editorial
she's writing.
The train pulls into a station and stops, causing Annie to
take a break and stretch her arms and neck. She looks out the
window for the first time and sees:
A MAN, his hands in his pockets, waiting on the platform. She
watches as the Man holds out his arms to his two young
children, who are getting off the train. He picks them up as
his wife enters the scene, kissing him and wrapping her arm
around his waist. The children talk a mile a minute and the
father listens to every word.
Annie doesn't even realize she is staring. As they leave the
platform, she turns back to her laptop. As the train begins
to move again, Annie returns to work.

touching the land -- is riding along a creek. Closer up, we
see he's rustling the bushes with a stick. Some stray cows
run out of the bushes. Tom races after them. His horse
shepherds the cow across the creek and up a hillside.
At the top of the hill, with the ranch spread out endlessly
before him, Tom sees Frank on his horse, chasing strays. Tom
whistles. Frank waves back. In the near distance, a pickup
truck is parked on the range.
Joe and the TWINS are throwing food pellets out of the back
of the truck. Cattle come from across the range for the food.
What begins as a handful of cows becomes dozens, then
hundreds -- the truck virtually disappearing among them.
Tom stops for a moment to look out at his ranch. Far off in
the distance, he sees Annie's Suburban coming along the road
to the ranch. He watches as Annie's distant figure gets out
of the car with Grace. Annie instinctively turns and looks
across the land. Even though there is such a distance,
there's a sense Tom and Annie are looking at each other.
Tom senses Joe driving Frank's truck, slowly moving off the

Tom, taking the rope tether, unhooks it from the pole. He
starts to lead Pilgrim out of the water. Pilgrim, fearful,
fights him. He rears, splashing Tom, not wanting to come out
of the water. Grace is worried. She looks to Joe and sees he
is concerned too, though he stands quietly.
Annie hears the commotion from where she stands and finishes
her call to return to the pond.
Tom enters the pond, waist deep in water, trying to grab
Pilgrim's rope. Pilgrim rises up, rearing at him. Joe and
Smokey, sensing danger, come closer to the pond. Annie
appears beside Grace and watches as Tom reaches for the rope

starts circling the ring. He sees Tom holding a saddle.
Pilgrim walks towards him. Curious, he stops, looking at him.
Tom puts the saddle down, sitting crossways on it. Pilgrim
walks towards him again. He stops, looking at Tom again. Tom
just sits there, playing with the bridle. Pilgrim walks
around him. Tom doesn't show him any interest. Pilgrim comes
closer. He looks at the saddle. He runs off. He stops,
looking back. Tom just sits. Pilgrim walks back over. Tom
stands and shows him the bridle. Pilgrim comes closer,
sniffing it. He rubs his nose against the leather. Tom pats
his head. Then, in one quick, but deft motion, he puts the
bridle on him. Pilgrim tosses his head, but it doesn't seem
to bother him. Grace and Annie watch intently. Tom takes the
reins, walking Pilgrim around the ring. He walks him to the
saddle. Pilgrim paws at it with his hoof. He turns and runs
off. Tom lets him go. Pilgrim runs around the ring, slows
down, looks over at Tom. Tom picks up the saddle. Pilgrim,
cautiously, comes back over. Tom, with the saddle, walks away
from him. Pilgrim, again curious, follows him. He nudges Tom.
Tom stops. Pilgrim comes around to take a good look at the
saddle. Tom rubs his back. And gently, like laying down a
sheet, puts the saddle on his back. Pilgrim shuffles slightly
at the touch. Tom quickly cinches it. Taking up the reins, he
walks Pilgrim around the ring again. He starts to jog.
Pilgrim jogs with him. And in the middle of the jog, Tom
grabs onto the saddle horn, and without breaking his stride,
pulls himself back up onto his back. He lays across the
saddle, letting Pilgrim feel his weight. He sits up, and
without letting him break his stride, he urges Pilgrim with
his thighs, keeping him in the jog, riding around the ring.

back. Stomps his feet. Grace is about to turn and leave, but
she stops herself and remains still.

sides heaving, panting like an asthmatic, making loud rasping
