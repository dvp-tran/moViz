The suggestion of traveling through space. Suddenly a star
sparkles to life in the distance. Gives rise to another...
and another... until we're looking at a whole galaxy of stars.
No, not stars. LIGHTS. NEON LIGHTS. A throbbing skyline of

gone theme park. Gigantic behemoths of pulsating neon: THE
MGM GRAND... EXCALIBUR... LUXOR... TREASURE ISLAND... passing
revamped faithfuls like CAESARS and THE DESERT INN...
...then heading DOWNTOWN to Fremont Street, where ""old school""
Vegas makes its last stand. BINION'S HORSESHOE, THE FOUR
QUEENS, THE LAS VEGAS CLUB arid...
THE SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO
One thing's for sure. This place ain't no bastard child of
Epcott Center. At least, not yet. Sure there's some flash
going on, but it's more class than overkill.
This is where the pro's come to savor a time forgotten. A
joint where every dealer knows your name. Where part of the
allure is the smell of moldy paneling and the tactile whisper
of worn felt. Where ""funny business"" doesn't just get you
blacklisted... It gets you dead.
Lets us enter."|stage direction

TRACKING SERIES —
-- the figure (seen in soft focus) passes a ROULETTE TABLE,
the wheel already in mid-spin. His hand casually brushes the
side of the table... and we PAN ACROSS to the wheel -- just
in time to see the ball landing on 00. The players HOWL
defeat. The croupier rakes in all the losing checks with a
slight nod of respect to the passing wraith...

the players' stunned reactions. No way! One of the players
instinctively glances behind him... but the figure has moved
on. The dealer stifles a grin, her eyes following the figure
as he heads toward...
-- A HOT CRAPS TABLE. The CROWD APPLAUDS as the shooter lands
a hard eight. The dice are fished back to the player. He
shakes them up with double ought bravado. We RACK from his
hand LARGE in the f.g. to our murky figure passing in the
background. The player throws... (we keep tracking with the
figure) as the stickman calls it: SEVEN OUT! to a thundering
chorus of disappointment.

background, we see a growing line of shame at one of the ATM
MACHINES.

gaming tables. Takes his time about it. His approach brings
an ill-wind to the area. The players appear to sense it.
It's in their reactions. A slight hesitation of the dice.

Suddenly the office door swings open. THREE MEN stride in.
Shelly projects immediate deference to NICKY ""FINGERS""
BONNATTO. Mid-50's. Former Geovassi family underboss from

became the weapon of choice in the ""family"" business. He
wears his corporate makeover like a bad coat of paint with
traces of Mulberry Street primer showing through.
Nicky's accompanied by a pair of CORPORATE TYPES in Hugo
Boss threads. Shelly glances their way with a look that

fest out there? You know what that
is? That's a fucking violation of

They converge at their doors at the same time. There's a
weariness about the hooker that's endemic to this town. She

odd: an empty cat food bowl on the kitchenette floor. No
sign of a cat. Go figure.
Bernie heads over to the dresser. A half-filled bottle of
gin rests next to a lone glass with a crack down the side.
He pours himself a shot. Turns on the TV. A religious channel.
Shitty reception.
ON SCREEN:
an Appalachian Pentecostal service. The members of the
congregation taking up snakes and writhing around in religious
hysteria, while a number at the bottom of the screen solicits
viewer donations.
Bernie doesn't even try to change the channel. He takes a

coming at him through the carpaccio thin walls.
The hooker's moans are starting to get to him. He raises his
fist to the wall, then stops himself. He's just not the
confrontational type.
Instead, he heads over to the TV, cranks the volume up. The
hysterical moaning from the snake ritual now blends in with
the grunting and groaning from next door, making for a bizarre

The singer sluggishly descends the stage to the lounge floor,
almost tripping over his microphone cable.
Buddy works the room, leaning in real close to the ladies,
delivering the requisite eye contact. When their companions
react with mock outrage, Buddy raises his fists playfully in
a boxer's defensive stance. It's classic Buddy Stafford
schtick.
From somewhere across the lounge, an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN jumps
up and throws her panties at Buddy. Buddy catches them and
waves them in the air... just as another pair whizzes by...
We PAN ACROSS to Shelly seated at his corner booth, in the
company of Nicky Fingers, Larry and Marty.
TIGHT ON SHELLY as he focuses on Buddy. A smile threatens
his patented stoicism. He's flashing back on the old days.
While Nicky and Marty are clearly enjoying Buddy's
performance, Larry fixates on the singer with joyless eyes.
We take on LARRY'S POV of Buddy --
SLOW MOTION CLOSE-UPS of BUDDY SINGING. The MUSIC SLOWED
DOWN with the action, emphasizing Buddy's lack of energy.
Sweat dripping off Buddy's forehead, splattering into tiny
jewels against his microphone. Buddy's tired eyes. Shaking
hands around the mic.

All this in the blink of an eye.
Natalie clutches Bernie's arm. Suppresses a hysterical, shock-
