slowly push in on the East Coast of the United States.
The camera glides down through the atmosphere, through

his snout inside the tube. Ted sits on the sofa, and for
the first time, we see Ted in his present day form: he is
ratty, patched-up, and worn-looking. He has a couple
stains, some small spots of exposed stuffing, and there's
evidence of some half-assed sewing. It's obvious he's
been around for three decades. He and John, who sits
next to him, are both clearly stoned as we join them.
John, for his part, looks far too comfortable in the too-
worn Red Sox T-shirt he wears. He eats directly from a
box of Fruity Pebbles. Reaching in for a last handful,
he finds the box almost empty. He raises it to empty the
remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours Fruity
Pebbles all over his face. It doesn't faze him much,
though, as he brushes them off. It's quite obvious that
this is a guy who has never really given up his
childhood... and has never given up his teddy bear. Ted
