3||EXT. EDGE OF CORN FIELDS - DAY|location
4|unknown|"A pocket watch. Open. Ticking. Swinging from a chain.
Held by a young man named JOE in a clearing beside a Kansas
corn field. Sky pregnant with rain.
Waiting. He checks the watch, removes his earbud headphones,
stands.
Without much ceremony a BLOODIED MAN in a suit appears from
thin air, kneeling before the young man. Hands and feet
tied. Burlap sack over his head. Muffled screams, gagged.
With no hesitation Joe raises a squat gun and blows the man
apart with a single cough of a shot."|speech
5|LATER|"Joe loads the corpse into the flatbed of his truck.
Cuts open the back of the body's jacket, revealing FOUR bars
of gold taped to the dead man's back. Joe takes them."|speech
6||EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY|location
7|LATER|"Massive, in the middle of nowhere. Black smoke.
JOE (V.O.)
Time travel has not yet been
invented. But twenty five years
from now it will be. Once the
technology exists, it will be
relatively cheap and available to
the public at large. And so. It
will be instantly outlawed, used
only in secret by the largest
criminal organizations. And then
only for a very specific purpose.
Joe drives up and parks his truck, removes the wrapped corpse
from the flatbed.
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
It's nearly impossible to dispose
of a body in the future. I'm told.
Tagging techniques, whatnot. So
when these future criminal
organizations in the future need
someone gone, they use specialized
assassins in our present, called
loopers."|speech
8||INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY|location
9|LATER|"Cavernous and empty. Joe carries the body to an iron hatch,
opens it, and dumps him in.
2.
JOE (V.O.)
And so. Thirty years from now. My
employers in the future nab the
target, they zap him back to me,
their looper. And I do the
necessaries. So the target has
vanished from the future, and I've
just disposed of a body that
technically does not exist. Clean.
The body slides down a long chute. Vanishes in a little
flare of angry red fire."|speech

Slips down a narrow passage, which ends at a steel wall with
a protruding duct taped camera and microphone."|speech
23|JOE|"Two, Jedd.
3.
Joe fishes the two gold bars from his jacket.
A small narrow slot slides open in the wall, and gnarled old
hands take the gold bars. It slides shut again.
In the background the front door to the pawn shop dings open.
The slot slides open and Jedd's hands push a wad of cash.
Joe pockets it, and backs around Dale, another Looper."|speech
24|DALE|Hey Joe. Be at the Belle tonight?|speech

you back? How much?
Seth holds a quarter idly in his palm."|speech

Tonight. Heads or tails, call it

The coin lifts, floats several inches in the air, quivering.

with me instead.
Joe notices the floating quarter."|speech

it was on every magazine - ‚ÄúNext

Dale makes a quarter float above his palm. Joe rolls his
eyes."|speech
80|JOE|For what?|speech
81|DALE|"He closed his loop.
This lands heavily on Joe."|speech
82|JOE|"No shit?
The door at the bottom of the stairs opens, and ZACH, another
looper, steps out. An OLDER MAN'S HAND pats his shoulder
then retracts into the door.
The loopers watch him in awe.

There's a reason we're called
loopers."|speech

Obviously performing a similar ritual to Joe's.
JOE (V.O.)
Time travel in the future is so
illegal, that when we sign up for
this job we agree to a very
specific proviso.
8.
Zach raises his gun.
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
If our employers in the future get
busted up by the law, their first
priority is going to be erasing any
trace of their relationship with us
ever existing.
A flash of light, and a HOG TIED MAN with a sack over his
head kneels in front of Zach.
Zach fires, and the man's chest explodes.
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
So. If they're busted, and if
we're still alive 30 years from
now, they'll find our older self
and zap him back to us, like any
other job.
Zach rips open the back of the corpse's jacket, revealing
several dozen gold bars taped to his back.
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
This is called closing your loop.
Zach freezes. Looks at the shape of the corpse's face
through the sack.
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
And you get paid out a mythic
amount of money, and you get a
handshake and get released from
your contract. Enjoy the next 30
years."|speech

Wide and deeper than you'd expect, lined with gold bars. Big
enough for a man. Seth scrambles in.

impossible to hit anything farther
than 15 feet, and impossible to
miss anything closer. A gun for

His gun spinning gets fancier. His gun meaner looking than

Lowers his gun.

On the palm of his right hand, a WEATHERED SCAR. Clearly
carved in the shape of an arrow, pointing down to his wrist.
Old Seth squints at it, confused. He pulls back his sleeve,

gone, its stump worn with age.
Old Seth stares. And now his middle finger is gone as well.
A freight train whistle moans. The cars, open and inviting,
leading out of town. Behind him, the city.
Terror and indecision seizes his chest, so much so that it
takes a moment for him to realize the sound of his breathing

Hand on his gun. Breathing shallow. Something is wrong.

But different. Not kneeling. On his side, so he flops over

Holy shit.
Joe raises his gun, scared. Time slows. Finger tightens on
the trigger.
Then he sees: the man has NO SACK ON HIS HEAD. And the face
that stares back at Joe is his own.
57 YEAR OLD JOE. His eyes fixed on Joe.
And for just one split second, Joe's face slackens, and his
finger eases on the trigger.
It's all the hesitation Old Joe needs. He throws his body
into a spin.
Joe snaps out of it, and PULLS THE TRIGGER.
The shot catches Old Joe square in the back, and the impact
blows him forward. But instead of blood beneath his torn
jacket's back, we see the layered gold bars spill out. They
caught the blast.
In what seems like one fluid motion Old Joe's fingers grab
one of the bars, he spins again, throwing handfuls of dirt
and the bar back towards Joe.
Joe flinches, again just for a moment, and when his eyes
focus again and his arm steadies the gun it's too late.

He blasts like hell into the hallway. A few shots return but
mostly the men are trapped. Then it's over. All is smoky
still for a moment.
104.
Old Joe stares at the exit door ajar, down the long hallway
jammed with bodies. Then at the passage that leads deeper
into the club.
A Gat Man runs in, and Old Joe shoots him down.
He steps into the coat check and loads his pockets with guns
and grenades. Then launches himself into passageway towards
the club."|speech

grenades in front of him, then unloading his automatic rifle
into the smoky aftermath.
And with a mixture of dumb luck and skill from years of being
gangland muscle takes out Gat Man after Gat Man.
The corridors are tight, twisty. Old Joe uses that.
Throwing grenades. Blasting away. Purging. Killing
everyone he lays eyes on. Wiping them out. All the bad guys.
It's horrible. Men maimed, bleeding and crying, dying the way
people actually die from gunshots. Old Joe forges on, deeper."|speech

tenses. The cloud gets closer. It is a truck. An armored
truck.
Joe squints. It's the ARMORED TRUCK that Kid Blue loaded his
gold bricks into. The front windshield blown in.
The truck stops fifty feet away, and Old Joe steps out. He
throws a gold bar, which lands in the dusty highway between
them."|speech

take your money, and you go live

Joe fires again, close enough now to draw blood off Old Joe's
chest and knock him back.
Out of nowhere a SLAT BIKE careens around the van, which has
until now blocked our line of sight down the highway.
Kid Blue.
The bike clips Joe's leg, sending him spinning violently to
the dusty pavement.
The bike shoots off down the highway, a cloud of dust in its
wake. It takes a hundred yards for the Kid to pull it to a
stop and spin it around.
Joe is hurt bad. He grapples for his blunderbuss.
Kid Blue guns the engine, gat in hand. Levels it, steady as
a rock.
Joe shoots at the Kid, but he's out of range, the gun fires
scattershot.
Kid Blue fires, a bullet hits dangerously close to Joe.
Panicked, Joe begins firing at the pavement around him, round
after fiery round.
Kicking up dust. Lots of dust. Raising a cloud.
KID BLUE'S POV - zooming towards Joe, now obscured in a cloud
of dust and smoke. He fires his gat into the cloud, tries to
slow the bike but can't in time.
In the dust cloud Joe hears the bike roaring down upon him.
He covers up and when he feels the bike roaring past blindly
FIRES his buss.
A moment later the bike emerges from the dust cloud. Without
a driver. It skids, crashes.
When the dust clears away Joe lies still, arms over his head.
107.
Besides him, the broken remains of Kid Blue.
Painfully, Joe raises himself. Then realizes:
Old Joe is gone."|speech
