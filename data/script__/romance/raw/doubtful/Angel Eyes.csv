As OPENING CREDITS play, we study the city's nighttime
pulse, ribbons of headlights moving and cross-connecting
like blood through the veins of a body --
impressionistic, even beautiful, but what we're hearing
is soulful trumpet-based MUSIC, mellow and haunting, the
modern classic -- JAZZ sound of a Wynton Marsalis,

Now the MUSIC is GONE, SOUNDS are MUFFLED and vision
blurred. We get the impression of urgent movement. We
hear BREATHING. There are VOICES, SHOUTS, even SCREAMS,
but MUFFLED, far away. Only the breathing is distinct.
We come to realize it is our breathing, and we are inside
someone, looking out. The man whose POV this is is on
the edge of consciousness and not far from death. He
lies on the pavement of a freeway at the site of an
accident only minutes after impact.
His VISION goes IN and OUT of clarity. People are
swarming around him and rushing by toward the carnage of
wrecked vehicles. A SIREN BLOOMS in the distance and
approaches haltingly. The man slips away, comes back
toward consciousness, slips again.
The crowd around the downed man parts to allow passage to
a police officer. It is a woman, Officer SHARON POGUE,
LAPD. She kneels at the man's side, taking charge,
speaking, but we hear only SLIVERS of SOUND. He sees her
face clearly now, close above him.
Sharon is   a dedicated professional and more. We see down
into her   to a place of real caring. She stares into our
eyes and   connects. We begin to hear her now -- and there
are more   SIRENS converging in b.g."|stage direction

openly, without a trace of fear. The man has been
through some kind of fire, and it has left him different

He puts it in his pocket, walks on.
Now the car, the prowling, MUSIC-BLASTING, BASS-
THUNDERING CAR turns a corner and begins rollling along
slowly -- beside Catch. He glances over, walking on.
There are four tough-looking MEN in the car, looking for

door and notices a set of keys dangling from the lock.
He pauses -- and then knocks softly on the door.
Someone looks through the peephole and then opens the

In the drawer is a collection of kids' toys, some found,
some purchased, mostly plastic figures. The action of
opening the door has started some battery-operated
animals moving around in there. Now from his pocket he
takes the plastic superhero he just found and drops it in

yeah, I'll show you a damn

picks me up off the floor and
throws me on the couch. I hit
that couch and bounce off, and he
grabs Larry and throws him on the
couch, and then... then he starts
making these monster sounds, and
he says, we came to earth to kick
ass, and I run at him and jump on
him and he tosses me on the couch
and then Larry, and we're laughing
so hard I almost wet myself, and
he keeps tossing us and growling
and beeping, and it was... it was
great. It was great, and I'm
never going to forget that.
Never. And I miss that. I miss
it. So I just... I wanted to tell
you tanks for that, Dad. Thanks.
That's all."|speech

street that    halts her. She stops still, surprised and so
pleased.
