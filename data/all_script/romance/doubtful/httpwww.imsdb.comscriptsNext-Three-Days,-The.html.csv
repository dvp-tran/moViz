unsnaps her seat belt and reaches for the door handle. The
driver, JOHN, sees her door open and dives to GRAB her. The
SUV spins, HORNS BLARE, TIRES SCREECH, cars swerve to avoid
collision. We aren't sure what is happening, but we know
something has gone terribly wrong. Cut to BLACK. Read:

4||"Two couples sit at a table, picking at dessert, JOHN and
LARA BRENNAN on one side, MICK and ERIT on the other. JOHN
is attractive in a worn kind of way, but has the eyes of a
kid with a discipline problem. You have to really know him
to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you. He
is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd.
LARA looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit. She appears
to have had a hard day at the office. She's been drinking
at dinner; it hasn't eased her nerves. John's good-looking
brother, MICK, boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous,
if slightly trashy, girlfriend, ERIT, who isn't ashamed of
her body or sharing her opinions. JOHN and MICK are laughing.
Lara puts cash on the tray beside Mick's credit card.
LARA
You know what? If you were smart
you would stop talking right now.
ERIT
Sue me. I just know that women should
never work for women.
John laughs and applauds.   Mick buries his head.
LARA
How can you say that??
ERIT
They're always threatened. Especially
if you're beautiful and they're not.
LARA
Erit, you are so full of shit.
ERIT
So, your boss isn't threatened by
you?

6||"LARA
Because she's a bitch! --
(as John and Mick laugh)
--Not because she's a woman.
ERIT
And you would describe her as
""attractive""?
LARA
That has nothing to do with it!
ERIT
And there is my answer.
JOHN
Either of you like another drink?
Lara shoots John a burning look as Erit builds on her victory.
ERIT
Women should work under men, men
under women. That's it.
JOHN
(egging her on)
But men under men?
ERIT
That's fine, too.
(the men burst into laughter)
They're used to it! Why are you
laughing?
MICK
(re: Erit)
I don't know, bro, but I think I'd
rather work under you than her.
ERIT
(insulted, shoots back)
Oh please, I'd rather work under
him, too.
That was a dig at Mick but Lara is primed for a fight.
LARA
You'd rather ""work under"" John?
ERIT
You have a problem with that, too?

8||"LARA
No, why would I have a problem with
your little sexual innuendo?
ERIT
What is up your ass tonight??
Mick throws John a ""This is all your fault and now it is
going to explode"" look. John feigns complete innocence.
LARA
So, I shouldn't take offense that
you're coming on to my husband right
in front of me.
ERIT
(claws out now)
Lara, if I wanted your husband I
would have him.
LARA
How? You couldn't possibly show him
more of your tits.
The men are on their feet before blows are exchanged.
ERIT
-- You know what your problem is?!

Lara step into foreground, Lara still fuming.
JOHN
She is completely full of shit.
LARA
DON'T try and agree with me now.
JOHN
You know what? I don't even believe
she is in the dental profession.
Lara knows this game; he is trying to get her out of her
black mood, and she has no intention of letting him.
LARA
Shut up.

I bet she can't even spell
anesthesiologist. Woman's a complete
fraud.
LARA
We went to her office party, idiot.
JOHN
I think she hit on me that night,
too.
Lara opens the back door of their black Prius and tosses in
the raincoat she was carrying. They climb in, under....
LARA
You are completely delusional. She
wasn't even hitting on you in there;
I just don't like her.
JOHN
I understand. People who look like
that should not be allowed anywhere
near oral surgery.
She feels a smile coming to her lips and tries to force it
away.
LARA
You are such an asshole.
JOHN
You're in the chair trying to stay
calm; how are you supposed to do that
with those things hanging over your--
She can't stand how attractive he is in this moment -- she
stops him short by kissing him passionately. His hands slip
under her blouse; she tugs at his sweater.
JOHN (CONT'D)
Someone's going to --
Her hand goes to his pants. He yanks at the seat lever and
it goes crashing back, Lara landing atop him.
After a moment he sits up quickly and pushes down the visors.
She laughs and kisses him and they disappear into each other."|unknown

her to check the mirror. She tugs at the knot in her hair.

Thanks.   See you next weekend.
Jenna exits. Lara shows him that his sweater is inside out.

him. He pins her to the wall and they start all over again.

Squeeze in tight.
JOHN
You can't do this every morning.   It
is way too corny.
LARA
Smile.   It's just until he's eighteen.
It flashes. Lara kisses John, puts an alien-looking electric
toothbrush on the table & walks off to pour coffee to go.
LARA (CONT'D)
Present.
JOHN
(examining it)
Sweetie, you have to stop believing
everything you read in a catalogue.
LARA
You hate brushing your teeth; this
one brushes them in thirty seconds.
JOHN

I love brushing my teeth.

The lies your mother tells.
LARA
(ignoring him)
When's your last class?
JOHN
Three, and I have papers to grade.
Can you pick up Luke?

takes it and puts the keys with other visitors' belongings.
John guides his son toward the metal detector. Luke walks
through and the buzzer goes off.
John instinctively moves forward to help. A guard stops him
with a hand on his chest. On the other side of the metal
detector another guard runs a wand over Luke, pulls something
from his pocket, looks at it curiously.

It's a toy!

so close.
He looks back into the large communal visiting room; a dozen
round tables and plastic chairs. The concrete block walls
are covered with naive paintings in bright colors and messages
of hope. Luke plays at his feet with a basket of Legos.
The door at the far side buzzes, a guard opens it and
prisoners in red jump-suits marked VISITING ROOM enter.
Lara enters and looks around. She is pale, thin and her
hair has returned to its natural color. Lara hurries to him
and gives him a real kiss. She breaks and steps to Luke,
who plays with his back to her.
LARA
Hi honey. Can Mommy get a kiss?

Come on, give Mommy a kiss.
JOHN
Rat-Bag.   Give Mommy a kiss.

Every night at bedtime.

What are you building?    A fort?
