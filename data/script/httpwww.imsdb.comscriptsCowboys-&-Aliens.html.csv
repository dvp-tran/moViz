SPACE. Infinite stars. A TITLE:
1870. THE ARIZONA TERRITORY.
We descend past DARK CLOUDS. Violent FLASHES ripple within.
Thunder blends with DRUMS as we reach a BOX CANYON...
A BONFIRE -- SILHOUETTED BODIES -- APACHE WARRIORS
Whirling around the fire -- war paint -- masks and headdresses --
a RELIGIOUS RITE or CELEBRATION. On the periphery, we FIND...
A BEAUTIFUL APACHE WOMAN. Softly singing to the even more
beautiful BABY in her arms as we FOLLOW THEM INTO --
A TEEPEE. The simple melody of the woman's song as she lays the
baby on a blanket, gently swaddling it, LOVE in her eyes.
But.
The wind starts to HOWL. QRAJ. And then... a BURST OF
LIGHT through the opening of the teepee -- intense ULTRAVIOLET:
FWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSHHss!!!
THE E IRE TENT IS RIPPED UP INTO THE SKY, LEAVING THE WOMAN AND
HER BABY-EXPOSED!!!! She SCREAMS -- grabs her child and starts
to RUN -- CHAOS EVERYWHERE as the tribe scatters in TERROR --
Suddenly -- Apaches are getting YANKED INTO THE AIR by some
superior force -- PLUCKED savagely into the light, GONE -- as we
WHIP AROUND the horror show of SCREAMING, DISAPPEARING INDIANS --
And now -- A DEAFENING SHRIEK AS STRANGE DOMED OBJECTS HURTLE
DOWN, CRASHING LIKE COMETS TO THE CANYON FLOOR AND CRUSHING
FLEEING PEOPLE.
Impossibly, the objects are STEEL MACHINES. BELLY VENTS snap
open and DRILL CONES drop out -- jagged teeth CHURN TO LIFE --
faster -- FASTER -- as the drills begin CHEWING INTO THE GROUND.
THE WOMAN -- staggering back in SHOCK and AWE -- clings to her
baby for one final SCREAM and -- BLACK. Over which we read:

Lying in the barren DESERT. Out cold. Handsome... but HARD.
We'll call him THE MAN IN BLACK, the color of his dirty clothes.
2.
A PINK TONGUE LICKS HIM. The man STARTS AWAKE -- to find a
MONGREL DOG over him. Mangy. But sweet.
COUGHING, the man stumbles up. How'd he get here? And where
the hell i.: here? And -- OWWW. A GASH in his side...
.. part of the wound oddly SEARED. He winces. Trying to solve
this painful puzzle. Something GLINTS on his wrist:
A STEEL BRACELET. No clasp to pull it off. He touches the
surface -- TSSS -- SHIT -- It's HOT!
And there's a BLACK STETSON on the ground. The Man grabs it to
shield his eyes... but STOFS:
A WORN PHOTOGRAPH in the inner brim. A WOMAN. Young,
beautiful. SMILING.
The Man stares: does he KNOW this woman? is this even HIS hat?
The dog BARKS ALERT. The man turns -- QUICK -- his hand reaches
toward his hip on INSTINCT but there's no holster. NO GUNS.
THREE RIDERS ON HORSEBACK ARE COMING OVER THE RISE:
THE CLAIBORNE BROTHERS -- WES, MOSE and LUKE. Dusty and tough.
Wes gallops right up to our Man, gives him the once over --"|speech
4|WES CLAIBORNE|Howdy.|speech
5|(NO RESPONSE)|"We're riding towards Absolution. You
know how far west we are?
The Man's got NO IDEA what he's talking about."|speech
6|LUKE CLAIBORNE|"Maybe he's a dummy.
Wes hops off his horse, right in The Man's face now --"|speech
7|WES CLAIBORNE|"There a reason you don't wanna answer my
question, friend?
And now, Mose nods to the BRACELET on The Man's wrist --"|speech
8|MOSE CLAIBORNE|"Wes, he's got iron on his wrist... and
he's been shot."|speech
9|LUKE CLAIBORNE|"Bet he's a chain jumper.
Luke spurs his horse behind him -- The Man's SURROUNDED.

10|LUKE|"If he escaped, there'll be a bounty.
Let's bring him with us.
Wes nods as he slides a SAWED-OFF DOUBLE-BARREL from his back
scabbard. COCKS both barrels. The dog GROWLS --"|speech
11|WES CLAIBORNE|"Not your lucky day, Stranger -- turn
round and start walking.
But The Man doesn't move. The Claibornes share glances. Wes
steps forward -- RAISING HIS RIFLE --
WES CLAIBORNE (CONT'D)
Dead or alive, no difference. I said"|speech
12|WALK OR--|"THE MAN MOVES, A MECHANISM OF BRUTAL VIOLENCE -- YANKS the rifle
forward as BLAMI -- shot goes WILD -- suddenly the gun's in THE
MAN'S HANDS -- BLAXI Wes is BLOWN backwards, HOLE IN HIS CHEST!
As Hose draws his Enfield, The Man FLIPS the rifle again --
SLAM! MOSE FLIES OFF HIS SADDLE as The Man rolls -- UNDER
Luke's horse -- GRABBING Luke's ankle -- suddenly Luke's FLAT on
his back -- BREATHLESS, staring UP at the double-barrel:"|speech
13|LUKE CLAIBORNE|"-- P-please, God -- d-don't --
-- The Man PULLS the trigger but CLICK! The rifle's EMPTY.
Luke's RELIEF is short as The Man SLAMS the gun-butt down,
knocking him out cold. And ALL of this took about ten seconds.
This man is a cold-blooded KILLER. But somehow... he didn't
seem to KNOW that. CONFUSION. Drops the rifle, looks down at
his hands... covered in BLOOD. And the BODIES in his wake.
The WIND loosens a piece of PAPER from Wes's jacket. It DANCES
on the breeze -- flattens against The Stranger's foot. He picks
it up, BLOODY FINGERPRINTS on what we now see is a TELEGRAM --
""TO FORT STANTON -- STOP -- ABSOLUTION TOWNSHIP BESIEGED BY
OUTLAWS -- STOP -- FIFTY DOLLARS FOR ANY MAN WITH A GUN -- STOP
-- ABSOLUTION AWAITS -- STOP""
THE MAN IN BLACK
(a hoarse whisper)
Absolution...
SLAM TO MOMENTS LATER:
With a HYA! The Man sends two horses GALLOPING, mounts the
third, wincing at that gash in his side. Starts to trot off...
sees the dog following...
4.
THE MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D)
Get outta here. Leave me alone.
But the dog keeps following. Like they're FRIENDS now. The man
turns away dismissively as we BOOM UP to reveal the WIDE OPEN
VALLEY below... and a SPECK within it that is:"|speech
14||EXT. TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY|location
15|LUKE CLAIBORNE|"A CROOKED SIGN: ""ABSOLUTION."" The town is dismal and forgotten.
Crumbling buildings blistered by sun. The Man rides in --

His eyes fall on the first building he sees... A CHURCH."|speech
16||INT. CHURCH - DAY|location
17|LUKE CLAIBORNE|"BAM! The door flies open and VOTIVE CANDLES FLICKER. The Man
looks at the dog and says --
THE MAN IN BLACK
Stay.
The dog sits by the door as The Man enters -- EMPTY -- he's
moving -- into a small kitchen area -- bottle of whiskey --
uncorks it with his teeth -- drinks -- pours some on the wound --
then A PISTOL COCKS behind him --
Meet MEACHAM, town preacher, a tough, wash-foot Baptist:"|speech
18|MEACHAM|"Palms to heaven, Friend.
The Man freezes. Turns up his hands.
THE MAN IN BLACK
Been shot."|speech
19|MEACHAM|"Only two kinds of men get shot --
criminals and victims.
(steps forward; hard)
Which one're you?
THE MAN IN BLACK
don't know.
Meacham hears the HONESTY in his voice. Knows a lost soul when
he sees one. Lowers his gun, softening..."|speech
20|MEACHAM|"Got a name, son?
THE MAN IN BLACK
Don't know that either.

Meacham's studying The Man's wound:"|speech
24|MEACHAM|"Odd wound. Looks... cauterized.
(off The Man's look)
Means somethin' burned it half closed.
The Man just stares. News to him. And now, as Meacham leans
over the wound, the METAL CROSS around his neck begins to
twitch... lifting ever so SLIGHTLX off his chest -- towards the
strange BRACELET on the Man's wrist. Meacham reacts --"|speech
25|MEACHAM (CONT'D)|"Nice trick. That some kinds... magnet?
The Man looks at him -- ""What the hell is a 'magnet'?!?""
Meacham shrugs it off, readies the needle --"|speech
26|MEACHAM (CONT'D)|"Try'n hold still.
He pokes the hot needle through the wound -- The Man winces
slightly, but bears the pain."|speech
27|MEACHAM (CONT'D)|"Where'd you ride in from?
THE MAN IN BLACK
West. Woke up in the desert.
Looking up at the sun like I'd been
dropped outta the sky."|speech
28|MEACHAM|"Seems I remember a story about that
happening once... fella by the name of
Lucifer."|speech
29|(GRINS)|"How 'bout I just call you ""Luke,"" for
short.
But TheMan's distracted by his REFLECTION in a cracked mirror:
his own face unfamiliar. Meacham nods towards The Man's HANDS --

30|MEACHAM (CONT'D)|"That blood yours or somebody else's?
THE MAN IN BLACK
Three men rode up. Drew on me."|speech
31|(STILL CONFUSED)|My hands... moved on their own.|speech
32|"MEACHAM
(A BEAT)"|"Anything else you wanna confess to while
you got my attention?
And The Man senses somehow that, ygg, there is... but:
THE MAN IN BLACK
Everything that happened before I woke
up...
(shakes his head)
It's gone."|speech
33|MEACHAM|"Well. Too bad. Can't absolve you for
your sins if you don't recall 'em. That
bein' said...
Meacham looks up, eyes twinkling. This is not a fire n'
brimstone preacher. This is a guy who GETS IT --"|speech
34|MEACHAM (CONT'D)|"I seen bad men do good things and good
men do bad things. Whether you end up in
heaven or hell... it's not God's plan...
it's yours."|speech
35|(BEAT)|"You just got to remember what it was.
The Man considers. Darkly --
THE MAN IN BLACK
What if I don't want to remember?"|speech
36|"MEACHAM
(BEAT; GRINS)"|"Then you're probl'y goin' to hell.
On cue -- SMASH!!! The stained glass window EXPLODES as a
MOLOTOV COCKTAIL hurtles into the church. FIRE spreads around
the pews -- MEACHAM ACTIVATES -- tears curtains off the
confessional and uses them to STAMP OUT the fire --"|speech

981|JAKE|"(his eyes narrow)
What's 'phenomena'?"|speech
982|ELLA|"Big storms in places that don't get big
storms.
ON JAKE. Every fighting instinct in him suddenly IGNITED,
though he plays it down:"|speech
983|JAKE|You goin' down there yourself?|speech
984|ELLA|"Why? You worried about me?
You bet your ass he is. But, he shakes his head--"|speech
985|JAKE|"No, ma'am. You can take care of yourself
just fine.
(then; tips his hat)
Be seein' you around."|speech
986|ELLA|"goodbye, Jake.
He gets back on his horse. Starts to ride off. Happy BARKS and
trots alongside him. BARK BARK BARK. In dog that means ""Don't
be an idiot."" Jake glances over --
110."|speech
987|JAKE|"Get the hell away from me, you damn mutt.
(BARK, BARK)
Go on, GET.
He heels his horse, leaving Happy behind to WHINE.
Jake rides off into the sunset. But his heart's KICKING in his
chest. And this is pretty much where things usually end...
But. Jake pulls the REINS as he SIGHS. Turns the horse around.
TROTS back to Ella, whose smile WIDENS as he closes the gap
between them.
Finally STOPS right in front of her. And despite his best
effort to stay TOUGH... he just plain likes her:"|speech
988|JAKE (CONT'D)|"Abilene happens to be on my way.
He reaches out a hand... she takes it... as he PULLS HER UP INTO
THE SADDLE. Ella grinning ear-to-ear as she folds her arms
around his waist. Jake -- ever the outlaw -- grumbles:"|speech
