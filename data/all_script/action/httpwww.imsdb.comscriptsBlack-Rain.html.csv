garbage seems gift wrapped.  The VOICES continue over as
we move in on a particular building where a DOORMAN is

tuxedoed dealers and croupiers:  roulette, craps, Black
Jack.  Wall to wall people.  The fact that casino gambling
happens to be illegal in New York doesn't stop these
Connecticut slummers, hollow-cheek nightlifers, and junior
wiseguys from having a good time.
AT THE CARD TABLE
NICK CONKLIN, holding a dollar cigar, is trying to pull a
winning hand.  In his late thirties, Nick has the sort of
quiet good looks that takes an extra glance to appreciate.
His Moe Ginsburg rent-a-tux is too tight, his ruffled
shirt, out of date; Nick could care less.
Two other players are still in the game.  One of them is a
lithe DEBUTANTE surrounded by an entourage of giggling
friends and tuxedoed men.  The pot is huge.
Nick flips two one hundred dollar chips onto the pot."|stage direction

for the bar.
CHARLIE SKLOARIS, twenty-three, steps in front of the
debutante, blocking her path.

at him, he was right.  He shrugs, spreads his hands.

a.m. at the Lime House.
AT THE BACK TABLE
Our man CAVELLO is unloading steaming Scungilli onto an
already heaping plate in front of an imperious looking
JAPANESE MAN.  The Japanese Man, in his mid-fifties, wears
a gray suit, and not a strand of his jet black hair is out

Cavello's heavily accented English, sits between them.

NICK'S POV IN THE MIRROR BEHIND THE BAR:  two new Japanese
men step in the door.  Early twenties, spiky hair, dark
Versace suits.
NUMBER ONE
wears tortoise shell shades.  He coolly checks out the
room then nods to --
NUMBER TWO
who pulls a Spas 12, automatic shotgun from under his
coat, and spits out three rounds.  A window shatters.
Everyone hits the floor.
NUMBER ONE
slowly walks toward Cavello's table.
NUMBER TWO
covers the floor.  Abolofia's bodyguards show their empty
hands.
NICK AND CHARLIE
on the floor.  They don't have the artillery for this guy
either.
AT THE TABLE
Our Japanese businessman knows these people.  He eyes them
contemptuously.
Abolofia has put enough people in this situation to be
philosophical about it.  He stops chewing.  A tiny
hand motion to his bodyguards is enough to stop any
precipitous action."|stage direction

into the man's jacket and removes a small, rectangular,
plastic-wrapped parcel.
He feels its weight, then flips it to NUMBER TWO.
Abolofia, realizing that whatever is going on doesn't
affect him or his, resumes eating."|stage direction

169||"NUMBER ONE backs the blade off.  The man raises his napkin
to the small wound.  A droplet of blood has stained his
shirt collar.  NUMBER ONE turns around as if to leave.
What happens next could be a whim, an after thought.
Number One spins around and THRUSTS the blade deep into
the man's chest.  He withdraws it with a half twist, and
in the same motion fatally slashes the translator's throat
before the old man's body hits the floor.
Blood pours from the businessman's mouth onto his
Scungilli, spreading across the white cloth and onto the
floor.
CAVELLO
reaches for a gun under his coat.  But NUMBER TWO pumps
two rounds into his face.  At this range, there's not much

Nick, gun drawn, slowly rounds the corner to the alley:
it's the ad hoc drugstore for the night.  Drugs going up
and down in pails, two dozen junkies buying, shooting,
slumped on the ground.  Everyone scatters -- the one's
that can.
AN ABANDONED PAIL
swings slowly back and forth from three stories up.  Nick
cautiously moves down the alley, holding the gun in both
hands.  A Junkie steps out of a doorway, Nick swings his
gun and nearly blows him away.
NUMBER ONE
We see his eyes first as he steps out of the darkness at
the back of the alley.  From now on we'll call him KOBO.
His sunglasses are on his forehead; his hands dropped
casually at his side.  A very cool character.
Kobo slowly raises his hand, and making a gun with his
finger, slowly points and ""shoots"" at Nick... He lowers
his hand."|stage direction

kicks out his legs.
Kobo falls flat on his chest.
Nick pulls out his cuffs.  But Kobo lunges for Nick's
ankle and yanks it toward him.  Nick stumbles backward;
Kobo's on his feet.  Before Nick can stand, Kobo lands a
brutal kick to the side of Nick's head.
Nick gets up, barrels into him.  Kobo knees Nick in the
solar plexus, then lands two more well placed kicks in
Nick's back.  It's not that Nick's a bad fighter, it's
that this kid is so damn fast.
Nick slowly gets to his feet.  KOBO lands two more brutal
shots to the side of Nick's head.  He's a bloody mess.
TWO POLICE CARS
stop at the end of the alley.  FOUR OFFICERS climb out.
CHARLIE
joins the cops as they run down the alley to find Nick
getting pummeled.
Charlie shoots at Kobo.  Misses.  Kobo turns to see the
five cops, guns drawn.
Nick, on one knee, spits out blood and a few teeth.
Kobo calmly slips the shuto out of his coat pocket and
drops it next to Nick.  The blade gleams in the light.
