them...So, which one are you? Do you
just talk about it? Or do you stand up

145|EUNICE|"Their interest, Detective, is capturing
the men responsible for the murders of
22 of Boston's finest criminals. Y'see
public perception is that these boys
stepped in, did our jobs for us and
then disappeared into thin air as we
fecklessly searched for them. The FBI
tends to take exception to such things.
They coulda sent anyone. They sent me.
Why do you think that is?"|speech

that I make smart people feel like
retards. Now, we seem to be getting

perpetrators are devout. They would
never commit such an act on sacred
ground. And as for the victim?"|speech
170|DOLLY|"All their vics were criminals. Clearly
not the case here. So, it wasn't them
which means this is a local matter and
it falls under our jurisdiction. No
need for Federal involvement so with
all due respect...we'll see you later,
Special Agent Bloom."|speech
