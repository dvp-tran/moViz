2||"CYCLOTRON ROOM (CREDIT SEQUENCE) - DAY
A mighty WARNING KLAXON assaults our ears. A FLASHING RED
WARNING LIGHT stabs our eyes.
Several DIALS go into the RED. A hand pushes aside a
YELLOW THERMOS and pushes forward a RED POWER THROTTLE.
We hear the WHINING UP of a cyclotron. A DIGITAL DIAL
climbs to ""5% POWER."" A SPIDER crawls across a DIAL.
Begin OPENING CREDITS.
THE CYCLOTRON ROOM is in an old basement full of peeling
paint and plumbing wrapped with TAPE. Leaks are here and
there. COBWEBS are all around.
DOCTOR OTTO OCTAVIUS (OCK) is a strong but strange
featured man in his mid-fifties.
His assistant, WEINER, hovers nearby looking on. He's
open mouthed with a mindless kind of curiosity. WEINER is
a local, small-time hood hired by OCK to circumvent the
school administration and to ""procure"" whatever OCK needs
for his experiments. He shades his eyes against a searing
BLUE-WHITE BEAM that erupts from the WINDOW. THE ROOM IS
DIVIDED INTO A CONTROL ROOM AND THE EXPERIMENT CHAMBERS."|stage direction
3|WEINER|Whoa, whoa, whoa... what's that?|speech
4||"With a WHOOSH, the WINDOW EXPLODES, showering the TWO with
shards of GLASS, and throwing them to the floor."|stage direction
5||(rising)|location
6|OCK|"We begin again... let's kick in that new
transducer. See if we can double the
power output."|speech
7||(rising more slowly)|location
8|WEINER|Whoa, Doc... wait a minute...|speech
9||"But OCK is already at the THROTTLE. The cyclotron whirls
up. The lights go on. Louder, brighter than before. OCK
looks through the broken WINDOW into the EXPERIMENTAL
CHAMBER. The POWER DIAL inches upward, ""eight, nine...""
the BLUE-WHITE LIGHT is blinding now. The WHINE pitch is
shattering.
END OPENING CREDITS."|stage direction
10|OCK|Okey... dokey!|speech
11||The POWER DIAL hits ten.|stage direction
12||EXT. EMPIRE STATE UNIVERSITY - DAY|location
13||"As STUDENTS go to class, the sound of the cyclotron spills
out of the SCIENCE CENTER onto the grounds of Empire State
University.

can be a little backward around girls, especially pretty
ones like Liz."|stage direction

24|HARRY|Would you, uh... excuse us for a minute?|speech
25||"Despite PETER'S protesting body language, HARRY pulls him
away like a conspirator."|stage direction
26|PETER|What is it? what...|speech
27|HARRY|"Did the Astro-Physics Journal really
accept your paper?"|speech
28||(laughs, embarrassed)|location
29|PETER|"Yeah... well... all I got's the data but
they've agreed to publish it when it's
finished. You know... it's my
calculation on the Planetary Conjunction."|speech
30|HARRY|"And its influence on the anti-force.
Isn't it?"|speech
31|PETER|Yes. Look, Harry, I am busy with...|speech

Octavius."|speech
45||HARRY makes a gesture dismissing OCK as crazy.|stage direction
46|HARRY|Ock is nuts, don't you agree?|speech
47|PETER|"Ock is a genius, Harry. Crazy, Yes! But,
a genius misunderstood, and unappreciated."|speech
48||INT. CYCLOTRON AREA HALLWAY - DAY|location
49||"It is a basement hallway full of LOCKERS which STUDENTS
are banging open and shut as they put stuff in and take
stuff out. In their midst, a MAN is banging on the door
marked ""Cyclotron Room - Authorized Personnel Only!""
Professor ROSOMORF, SIXTISH, respectable, a good old
fashioned professor, he's the head of the Physics Dept.
With him is ALEXANDER THORKEL, a 40-ish, Waspish school
administrator. For a scientist as crazily focused as OCK,
THORKEL is a natural enemy."|stage direction
50||(knocking furiously)|location
51|ROZ|"Doctor Octavius! You are late for your
lecture. The students are waiting.
Doctor Octavius!"|speech
52|THORKEL|"Your friend is impossible Professor
Rosomorf, I told the board we should let
him go."|speech
53||"The LIGHT above THORKEL's head EXPLODES. Then all the
LIGHTS behind him EXPLODE in succession. THORKEL and ROZ
look amazed..."|stage direction
54|THORKEL|"What's he doing in there, not his crazy
experiment again."|speech
55|ROZ|"You mean his anti-force theory... one day
they'll give him the Nobel Prize for it."|speech

59||INT. OCK'S LAB|location
60|OCK|"The anti-force experiment has now reached
the limit of electronic overload safety.
Therefore, Weiner, you will disconnect
the overload safety device..."|speech
61||"FOUR WALDOS (three-fingered, snake-like mechanical arms)
suddenly thrust themselves into the CHAMBER and begin
working, each at a different task. OCK is an acknowledged
master at manipulating these WALDOS.
He flicks a switch and a searing BLUE-WHITE BEAM lances
down from a FOCUSING CONE and strikes a GRAM WEIGHT
marked, ""1,000,000""), illuminating it and filling our
ears with a splitting BUZZ TONE.
The knock on the door grows louder.
WEINER comes up behind OCK."|stage direction
62|WEINER|Whoa, Doc... someone's at the door...|speech
63||(ignoring)|location
64|OCK|"World class scientific mind and they
stick me in the basement with this third
rate cyclotron..."|speech

67||"The WEIGHT begins to jiggle and, for an instant, it
appears to lift ever so slightly."|stage direction
68||INT. COLLEGE PHYSICS LAB - DAY|location
69||"This is an enormous room, 100 lab tables. The yellowing
smoke of a thousand experiments hangs in the air. A HUGE
AMERICAN FLAG dominates the back wall.
PETER, HARRY and LIZ set up their TABLES. FLASH reads the
DAILY BUGLE sports section. PETER can't take his eyes off
LIZ. When she looks back he looks down at his GEAR."|stage direction
70||(softly)|location
71|LIZ|What is it, Peter?|speech
72||(embarrassed)|location
73|PETER|It's nothing.|speech

impatient."|stage direction
76|WEINER|Yes, gentleman can I help you?|speech
77|THORKEL|Tell your boss, that his class is waiting.|speech
78||(looks)|location
79|WEINER|You better tell him yourself.|speech

call."|stage direction
81|ROZ & THORKEL|Professor Octavius!!|speech
82||Professor OCK turns and looks at the bewildered men.|stage direction
83|OCK|Gentlemen, come, you must see this.|speech
84|ROZ|But, your students...|speech
85|OCK|"The imbeciles can wait... I have better
things to do than teach introductory
Physics Rosomorf. Undergrads are
kindless adolescence."|speech
86|THORKEL|You see he is impossible.|speech
87|OCK|"Thorkel you are the dummiest
administrator our university has ever had."|speech
88||(Thorkel turns to go)|location

93|LIZ|"Well, do you mean nothing... or do you
mean something but you won't tell me what
it is?"|speech
94||(regaining)|location
95|PETER|I mean plain nothing.|speech
96|LIZ|"Well, I guess that's about as nothing as
you can get... plain nothing.
A beat."|speech
97|PETER|Liz...!|speech
98|LIZ|Ahh, it is something.|speech
99|PETER|No... look.|speech
100||"The equipment on her TABLE is starting to vibrate. They
look at it, curiously. We hear the cyclotron's WHINE
begin to build..."|stage direction
101||INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - DAY|location
102||"Everything is shaking like in an earthquake... Roz and
Thorkel seem to dance in their place going crazy with
anger and surprise. The WHINE is deafening! The light is
blinding! WEINER has his eyes closed and his hands over
his ears."|stage direction
103|OCK|I am going for 20 percent power!|speech
104|THORKEL|NO!! Don't do that...|speech
105|ROZ|Ock! Its dangerous...|speech

108||INT. ELECTRICAL CONDUIT MONTAGE - DAY|location
109||"We follow the electrical overcharge as it crackles along
the WIRES and CABLES inside the WALLS and FLOORS. It is
making its way up to the LAB!"|stage direction
110||INT. LAB - DAY|location
111||"All the kids are now trying to hold onto their vibrating
equipment.
The CHARGE crackles up a WIRE and erupts at LIZ'S TABLE.
A BREAKER explodes in flames. There is an outburst of AD
LIBS: ""Fire!"" ""Everybody out!""
THORKEL (comes running he is shabby and bewildered) seeing
LIZ trapped behind the fire which is growing from second
to second."|stage direction
112|THORKEL|"Keep calm, everybody keep calm. Use the
front door. Everybody out the front."|speech
113|PETER|Liz! Come on...!|speech
114|LIZ|I can't. Help me!|speech
115|PETER|I'm coming!|speech
116||"He wades into the fire, but is beaten back by the FLAMES.
His sleeve is on fire. He pats it out."|stage direction
117|LIZ|Peter!|speech
118||Flash appears and tries to help but Thorkel stops him.|stage direction
119|THORKEL|"Get back, you idiots. You can't go in
there!"|speech
120||"LIZ smashes at the WINDOW, but this is an inner city
school and the WINDOWS are covered by STEEL GATES. Liz
wraps her fingers in the GATE."|stage direction
121||(out at the street)|location
122|LIZ|Help! Help me!|speech
123||"Outside the WINDOW the air is clear and people come and
go. Some are stopping to look up at the girl on the
second floor who screams (but they can't hear, of course)
down at them as the FLAMES close in behind her.
PETER comes flying in with a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. He
fumbles with it. FLASH pushes Thorkel, grabs the
extinguisher away from him with a scowl of disdain.
LIZ turns to face the FLAMES. Suddenly there is an
eruption of CO2 CLOUDS and the roar of a FIRE
EXTINGUISHER.
The FLAMES are beaten down enough for her to leap out.
FLASH is there, holding the EXTINGUISHER. People CHEER."|stage direction
124|PETER|Thanks for your help Flash.|speech
125|FLASH|No problem wimp.|speech
126|PETER|Our hero has a real way with words.|speech
127|LIZ|Oh, why don't you grow up.|speech
128||"PETER is stung, insulted, turns away.
ROSOMORF peeps in, worried -- faces Thorkel."|stage direction
129|THORKEL|"This man will bring a disaster upon this
university."|speech
130||"OCK comes in, starts his lecture calmly as if nothing has
happened."|stage direction
131|OCK|"The universe is made up of forces... and
counter-forces. Science is the study of
the forces!"|speech
132||"FLASH hands the EXTINGUISHER to PETER. LIZ embraces
FLASH, throwing a glimpse at PETER who tried so bravely.
He looks away and turns the last of the EXTINGUISHER on
the last of the FIRE."|stage direction
133||"(continues without a
hitch)"|location
134|OCK|"But I... Professor Otto Octavius... have
devoted my life to the study of the
counter-forces! Good job, Peter."|speech
135||"(taking place at lab
table)"|location
136|PETER|Thanks, Professor.|speech
137||"THORKEL has walked slowly and uncomprehendingly toward the
front of the huge LAB. He simply cannot believe OCK'S
behavior."|stage direction
138|THORKEL|I don't believe it, I simply don't...|speech
139|OCK|Can we carry on Mr. Thorkel.|speech
140|THORKEL|"I don't believe... oh, all right carry on
Professor."|speech
141|OCK|"Well! This week my dear students I have
made a stunning breakthrough..."|speech
142|THORKEL|"Wait a minute, wait a minute... you've
got fire forms to fill out, Dr. Octavius."|speech
143|OCK|"I have no time for forms, or
administrators who persist in
interrupting me, Mr. Thorkel."|speech
144||THORKEL steams out and bangs shut the DOOR.|stage direction
145|OCK|"I now believe its possible that these
counter forces can be... collected... the
way the magnifying glass collects the
sunlight... and focused into a hard beam
I call... Weiner!"|speech
146||"WEINER backs away from the BLACKBOARD to reveal a word
that OCK has scrawled in large letters. It says ""Anti-
Force."""|stage direction
147|OCK|I call it, the Anti-Force!|speech
148||"OCK is plugging a HUGE CABLE into a small LUCITE BOX with
a SILVER BALL inside it."|stage direction
149||(continues as he works)|location
150|OCK|"This anti-force, once harnessed, is
capable of undoing any natural force at
which it is aimed... for instance..."|speech
151||(looks up maniacally)|location
152|OCK|Gravity!|speech
153||"LIZ scribbles down a note and mouths the word ""gravity.""
Then she turns to PETER."|stage direction
154||(whispers)|location
155|LIZ|I'm sorry...|speech
156|PETER|It's alright.|speech
157||"OCK is ""playing"" his COMPUTER like the Phantom of the
Opera at the organ."|stage direction
158|OCK|"We patch in the cyclotron...
The lights flicker and go dim."|speech
159|OCK|"Pay no attention to the lights... I of
course steal its energy, and it looses
power. We patch in the cyclotron... and
we gradually apply power. The power that
I am stealing..."|speech
160||"As the WHINE builds in the LAB...
OCK peers through the LUCITE BOX at us, distorted by it.
The BOX is a miniature version of the cyclotron's
experimental chamber, and now the BLUE-WHITE glow begins.
It crackles round the SILVER BALL."|stage direction
161|OCK|"And so we stand, four square against the
fundamental force that orders and
maintains our universe... gravity...
which is holding down this goddamn ball.
Rise!"|speech
162||"The LIGHTS go totally dark. The kids react with WHOOPS
and CATCALLS."|stage direction
163|HARRY|What a crock...|speech
164|PETER|Shut up Harry... this is very interesting.|speech
165|OCK|"Mr. Parker! Have you some... interesting
observation you'd like to share with the
class?"|speech
166|PETER|No sir...|speech
167|OCK|"Then shut up! And pay some attention to
the experiment."|speech
168||"OCK peers at us through the LUCITE BOX as the SILVER BALL
begins to rise. OCK'S face is ecstatic."|stage direction
169|OCK|Rise! Rise!!!|speech
170||"The SILVER BALL suddenly shoots up, shattering the top of
the box. It flies up to the ceiling where it shatters a
LIGHT FIXTURE.
The shards rain down on OCK who reaches out and catches
the falling BALL and scales it in a raised fist."|stage direction
171|OCK|Now that's what I call an experiment!|speech
172||"The CYCLOTRON WHINE cuts out and OCK wheels to the
COMPUTER. He hits a KEY and several COLORED PROJECTION
BEAMS lance out of the back of the room. They pierce the
smoke and light a PROJECTION DISPLAY in the front.
TWO COLORED SPHERES one, YELLOW, one BLUE touch where
their circumferences meet. Behind them is a BLACK
depiction of ""space""."|stage direction
173|OCK|"You are looking at a representation of
two universes. Our Blue one. Our real
universe... something we can touch and
feel and see and draw calculations about.
This is us. The Yellow universe... this
is something else. Some other dimension...
something... on the other side!"|speech
174||"OCK hits another COMPUTER KEY and a hole appears where the
TWO SPHERES touch. The BLUE AND THE YELLOW MARBLEIZE with
each other. The colors swirl until both SPHERES are"|stage direction
175|"BRIGHT GREEN.
OCK"|"If it were possible to generate enough
power behind it, the anti-force could
wipe out not just gravity... but all our
universal forces at the same time. In
effect... it would blast a hole between
this universe and the next. Each..."|speech
176||(indicates green spheres)|location
177|"BRIGHT GREEN.
OCK"|"would flow into each other. No blue
universe. No yellow. End, finished,
over."|speech
178||(with a student's ear)|location
179|LIZ|"That sounds like a scenario for the end
of the world."|speech
180|OCK|"My girl, it is! It is. It would mean
wiping out everything that's known... and
letting in everything that's unknown."|speech
181|FLASH|Isn't that a little dangerous?|speech
182|OCK|"Don't worry yourself, true inter-
dimensional penetration is still purely
theoretical, but one day... Maybe very
near... maybe in the 21st century..."|speech
183||INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - DAY|location
184||"PETER, LIZ, FLASH and HARRY all take BOOKS from their
LOCKERS."|stage direction

186|LIZ|"Look, it's just... I don't know... when
you and Flash go after each other like
that..."|speech
187||(whispers)|location
188|PETER|He's not my type.|speech
189|LIZ|He doesn't have to be.|speech
190|PETER|Check.|speech
191|LIZ|And besides, he's not all bad.|speech
192||"PETER looks at FLASH who's a few LOCKERS down. FLASH has
taken a FOOTBALL from his LOCKER and is spinning it on his
finger with great joy and concentration."|stage direction
193|PETER|"You don't get nicknamed Flash because
you're a rocket scientist, Liz."|speech
194|LIZ|"Give it up, Parker. You'd die for a
nickname like Flash."|speech
195|PETER|Yeah, of embarrassment.|speech
196||"KIM comes by and leans seductively by her LOCKER. KIM is
a ripe one and hot-hot-hot!"|stage direction

198|KIM|"Hey, Flash... I'm scalping a pair of the
Midnight Madness Wrestling Match tomorrow
night."|speech

200|KIM|Would you pay $125?|speech
201|FLASH|"Well, uh, I... gee... if... can I tell
you tomorrow?"|speech

203|KIM|You snooze, you lose. Hiya Liz...|speech
204|LIZ|"Kim, you know Peter and Harry? This is
my new roommate... Kim Nickson."|speech

LOCKER. She wraps it around her neck and turns to the
boys.
They go bug-eyed!"|stage direction

210|LIZ|"We're going to the Student Reunion
Meeting. You coming?"|speech
211||"Peter looks at KIM. Wow. Then he looks at LIZ who's
adjusting herself in a small MIRROR. HARRY jabs him in
the ribs. Yeah, yeah!"|stage direction
212||(frustrated)|location
213|PETER|"I can't... I gotta go over to the Daily
Bugle. I'm trying to sell some photos."|speech
214|KIM|Soooh, a photographer...?|speech
215|PETER|"Just an amateur. Well... nice meeting
you, Kim."|speech
216|KIM|Yeah... I bet it would be.|speech
217|HARRY|"Can I be your date for the reunion
ShooShoo?"|speech
218|KIM|No Jerk!|speech

220|HARRY|What did I say...|speech
221|LIZ|"It's not what you said, it's how you say
it, ShooShoo!"|speech

bag down."|stage direction

WEINER."|stage direction

cry from the experiment in the LAB ROOM. It's a fantastic
netherworld to which no undergrad gains entrance. No one
but PETER.
OCK is sitting in a swivel CHAIR with his back to PETER.
He has the look of Captain Nemo in his Nautilus. This is
OCK'S domain."|stage direction

238||(flattered)|location
239|PETER|That would be... great.|speech
240||(turns with a smile)|location
241|OCK|"Now you take the Planetary Conjunction.
This Saturday night we will witness
Saturn, Jupiter, the Moon, the Earth, the
Sun... all in a row. Never seen within
the memory of man, or measured for its
effect. The total gravitational force
must be quite exceptional. Isn't that
the subject of your paper...?"|speech
242|PETER|"Yes sir, I've worked out a new way to
calculate the combined gravitational
effect."|speech
243|OCK|"I'm a busy man, Mr. Parker. But I think
I could find the time to go over it with
you. Make sure it all... checks out."|speech
244|PETER|"Well... I'm sort of working with
Professor Rosomorf and he suggested we
kind of keep it between us. He thinks
that my theory is... well, I don't know..."|speech

were interested... sorry, I've already
given it to... Professor Rosomorf, and he
is after all the head of our Physics
Department... and I couldn't..."|speech

my discoveries... something I never
showed to any other student... as a
matter of fact to anybody at all."|speech

love to... but I..."|speech

OCK turns to WEINER who slouches against the wall smiling."|stage direction
259|OCK|"The same academic world that's so keen to
embrace that boy's undergraduate work,
ridicules my anti-force theory as
quackery. I ask you, Weiner... what is
our society coming to? Ha!"|speech
260|WEINER|"They are all a bunch of brainless
assholes, that's what I say..."|speech
261|OCK|Weiner! Go get me that boy's data!|speech
