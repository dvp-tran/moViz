BODIES, frozen in contorted death poses. This was
furious, hand-to-hand fighting between human SOLDIERS and
nightmare CREATURES, their corpses now in piles to the
horizon.
The Dog climbs a mound of casualties. At the top, the
Dog looks back across the battlefield. The Dog's eyes

A ROYAL ENTOURAGE is gathered. The women weep, the men
agonize.
Palace Guards lift the Queen into a chest and chain it
closed. On the King's signal, the Guards carry the chest
to the edge and drop it into the rough sea. We HEAR a
SCREAM from within.
Some members of the Royal Entourage look with scorn at
their King, outraged by this double murder. Acrisius
registers their disapproving looks and angrily turns to
leave the promontory.
WE SEE in his face what the others do not -- shame and
doubt.

The Steward shrinks from this blasphemy, eyes darting in
