5||1 INT. LIMBO RADIO 1|stage direction
6|FADE IN:|"He is 20, normal looking, not too nebbish, punkish, bookish,
or stylish. He is a high-strung guy, enjoying a rare moment
of un-self-consciousness."|speech
7|MAX|"There's an old joke. It comes from ""The
Iliad,"" but I think it was popularized by
Oscar Wilde. It goes like this:
...A bear's taking a shit, like, out in the
woods one day. And he sees this rabbit,
also taking a shit. The rabbit, wait, I
mean, the bear, he's shitting up a storm,
cuz he's been eating Mexican. The
wiping's taking forever, and his shit
keeps sticking to his fur. Wait, what
happens next? Oh, right-- he asks the
rabbit if he ever has trouble wiping. The
rabbit says no, shit just slides right
off him. So the bear picks the rabbit up
and wipes his ass with him.
(pause, as if for applause)
Well, I never said it was a good joke.
And see, that makes it perfect, because
it's pretty much the story of my life.
We can now see that he's perched on a stool, wearing a REM t-
shirt and old jeans. He gesticulates vaguely as he talks."|speech
8|MAX (CONT'D)|"Growing up, my parents were huge Woody
Allen fans. Still are. Personally, I hate
him. Same thing with the Beatles, such a
part of my background that I must have
been about 16 by the time I realized how
useless it was to rebel by ignoring the
Beatles or any other cultural artifact of
their generation. Even if I did spend my
childhood hearing my father go on and on
about how, like, Nirvana would never mean
anything because they're not the Beatles,
blah-blah. I don't know, this is all
starting to sound a little bit too
angsty, you know, and that's about the
last thing I'm going for here... Shit, I
really got off track there, didn't I?
As Max shakes his head, a hanging RADIO MIKE comes into view.
It has the call letters of a college radio station on it.

High on the wall behind him, a glowing ""ON AIR"" light is
revealed. The perspective is skewed, the studio appears
cavernous and completely barren."|speech
9||2 INT. MAX'S CHILDHOOD HOME ­ FLASHBACK ­ DAY 2|stage direction
10|MAX (CONT'D)|"YOUNG MAX, about five, sits on the floor and watches BANANAS
with his FATHER, a large, relaxed man with a mustache who
reclines in a tacky 80's chair and smokes a cigar.
MAX (O.S.)
Anyway, like the Beatles thing­ and this
is the point of that whole long-winded
example­ I was force-fed Woody Allen from
a young age. I remember watching Bananas
when I was about five. Of course, I hated
it.
Young Max is laughing hysterically at the screen.
Max stands to the side, watching his younger self and his
father. The radio mike hangs in front of him."|speech
11|MAX (CONT'D)|"This is my old house. We lived here, in a
dull suburb of New York, until I was ten,
when we moved to a different house in a
different dull suburb of New York.
On TV, a woman is bit in the breast by a snake and is chased
by a group of soldiers."|speech
12|YOUNG MAX|Daddy, why are they running after her?|speech
13|"FATHER
(KINDLY)"|"Someday, you'll understand. Pay
attention, you'll learn something.
Young Max turns back to the screen, wide-eyed."|speech

15|"FATHER
(KINDLY)"|"In pajamas, ADOLESCENT MAX, 16, watches a newer TV in an
identical family room. This time, ANNIE HALL is playing.
MAX (V.O.)
Oh yeah. This wasn't the first time I saw
Annie Hall, but it was the first time I
actually appreciated it. I was flipping
channels on a Saturday afternoon, and
there it was, and I was stunned to find I
loved it, more stunned to find that my
parents may have had a point all along."|speech

MAX (V.O.) (cont'd)
Although, they were definitely wrong
about Bananas.
CLOSE ON: Adolescent Max, totally engrossed in the film."|speech

18|[MORE]|"Adolescent Max walks alone to class. Other students rush by
in groups. He looks a little lost.
MAX (V.O.)
Oh God, high school. I hated this place.
I was a Junior when I gave up trying to
fit in. Fortunately, being a social
outcast is a lot easier when your school
is filled with idiots.
A pair of GOTH POSERS pass. Max keeps his distance. From the
other direction, a 6 FOOT TALL GIRL makes eyes at Max. He
walks into a water fountain, drops his books."|speech
19||5 INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM ­ FLASHBACK 5|stage direction
20|[MORE]|"Adolescent Max gets hit in the face with a volleyball.
Everyone laughs at him, including the COACH.
Max stands to the side and winces."|speech
21|MAX|"There was something in Annie Hall I
identified with. Maybe it was the style
of humor, or the defeatist attitude, I
don't know. All I know is, I kept going
back. Different people are inspired by
different things, and my source of
inspiration became a 20-year-old movie
about a failed relationship.
The volleyball rolls over and he picks it up."|speech
22||6 INT. RADIO STATION -- PRESENT 6|stage direction
23|MAX|"From behind Max, we see the station as it really is: small,
dark, cramped, and totally filled with crap. Max wears
headphones, sits before a large console and audio gear.
He now holds a volleyball."|speech
24|MAX|"So after high school I ended up here.
There was never really any choice, not
going to college was not an option. Of
course, I brought Annie with me. Good
thing, too."|speech

26|MAX (CONT'D)|"Watching it quickly became about the only
thing I could count on to go right."|speech

lingering style-baggage from high school (eg. bad haircuts)."|speech

(TO CAMERA)"|"It was freshmen year when we started
watching Annie Hall as a tradition."|speech
30|(LOOKING AROUND)|"Jeez, this must have been the very first
time. What's Amy doing here? I'm pretty
sure Amy wasn't here.
AMY is attractive, bookish, and sitting on Max's bed.
CHARLES, a skinny guy in a large chair, tries to get her
attention by wiggling his eyebrows seductively.
Max puts the tape in the VCR, hits rewind, and moves to sit
on his bed. He pauses when he sees how close he'll come to
Amy. Finally, he climbs over her and awkwardly sits at the
far end.
Amy watches, rolls her eyes, and looks at BETH, who shakes
her head sadly. Beth is pretty in an earthy way, spunky and
sad at the same time. She looks sympathetically at Max, who
is trying not to act nervous (and failing).
The couple is SAM, who's short and charismatic, with a cool,
slightly punkish personal style; and JEN, same height, cute
and serious, conservative dress. They lie on the floor
together."|speech
31|"MAX (CONT'D)
(TO CAMERA)"|"That's Sam and Jen. Sam was the alpha-
male of our group, which tends to consist
mostly of zeta-males. He had been going
out with Jen a couple weeks and we were
all waiting to see if she would change
him...
Sam slides a pillow under her."|speech
32|SAM|Are you comfortable, honey?|speech
33|JEN|"I'm fine, Sam. I was worried about you.
Sure you don't want me to move over?
5."|speech
34|SAM|"Oh no, no, Jen, if you're happy, I'm
happy.
Max and Charles exchange a look-- there they go again. Max
makes a show of putting a pillow under a large Darth Vader
doll. Beth laughs, Amy is amused. Sam looks back and is
embarrassed. Jen rolls her eyes and gives Sam a look."|speech
35|JEN|Are we gonna watch this movie or what?|speech

38|SAM|Wow, what a good movie.|speech
39|AMY|"Oh, that was so sad! Relationships don't
have to be like that!"|speech
40|(TO MAX)|"I can see why you like this so much. It
reminded me of you."|speech
41|MAX|"Uh, thanks, I guess. Does that mean you
liked it?
Max and Amy stand and face each other as the lights fade to
black around everyone else."|speech
42|AMY|"I didn't say I liked it, I said it
reminded me of you. It reminded me of
what I didn't like about you, the
cynicism, the neurotic insecurity, and oh
yeah, when you started calling me every
day. All the reasons we were never more
than friends."|speech
43|MAX|Well, at least you're being honest.|speech
44|AMY|"Of course I'm being honest. This is a
fantasy extrapolated from a flashback.
How could I lie to you?
6."|speech
45|"MAX
(TO CAMERA)"|"I'm the only person I know who gets
insulted in his own fantasies.
Charles walks by, Amy takes his arm, and they disappear into
the surrounding darkness, which DISSOLVES TO:"|speech

50|MAX|"The movie is Annie Hall. The theater is emptying. Suddenly,
ERICA bursts through the crowd. Erica is mad. Max follows
behind her, placating."|speech
51|ERICA|"AND WHAT IS IT WITH JEWISH MEN AND THEIR
PENIS ISSUES?!
Max freezes in place. The entire crowd of students turns to
look at him. He manages a weak smile and turns back to Erica,
but she's gone, out the doors into the night.
Max turns back to the crowd and shrugs, but the crowd turns
away. Max suddenly sees someone: Beth, looking at him. He
blushes, self-conscious, and hurries away.
MAX (V.O.)
And even when it went right, it didn't."|speech
52||11 INT. STACY'S ROOM -- NIGHT -- FLASHBACK 11|stage direction
53|ERICA|Max and STACY stumble in, inebriated, laughing.|speech
54|MAX|"...And then I, then I, after I called the
pizza place, I called an ambulance, and
timed them."|speech
55|STACY|Who won?|speech
56|MAX|"The pizza, of course. The paramedics took
35 minutes to arrive.

57|STACY|"I can't believe you! Did you get in
trouble?"|speech
58|MAX|"The Station Manager said I couldn't go on
the air ever again."|speech
59|STACY|So what'd you do?!|speech
60|MAX|"I gave him the pizza!
They collapse on the bed, laughing. Stacy rolls over and
kisses Max on the lips. His eyes go wide and he frantically
crawls backwards."|speech
61|STACY|What? Don't you like me?|speech
62|MAX|It would never work.|speech
63|STACY|How would you know?|speech
64|MAX|I know. I have a sixth sense.|speech
65|STACY|You see dead people?|speech
66|MAX|"I see dead relationships.
Stacy sits up, frustrated, the mood ruined."|speech
67|"MAX (CONT'D)
(TO CAMERA)"|"That was all true, but there was
something else, though. I mean, there I
was, drunk, in a girl's bedroom, and the
only thought running through my mind was..."|speech

70|MAX|"...""What about Beth?""
Max is talking to Beth. It's a beautiful Spring day.
8."|speech
71|MAX (CONT'D)|"I mean, I know we're just friends, but
you really mean a lot to me and we've
been spending a lot of time together
lately, and maybe... I guess what I'm
saying is, maybe we could try going out
on a date or something?"|speech
72|BETH|Max...|speech
73|MAX|I mean, it wouldn't have to be, uh...|speech
74|BETH|Sure.|speech
75|MAX|We wouldn't have to... What?|speech
76|BETH|I'd love to. How's tomorrow night?|speech
77|MAX|"Um, yeah, it would have to be after, or
maybe... Yeah, tomorrow, uh, tomorrow
night's fine."|speech

81|BETH|Never?|speech
82|MAX|Not until Sam and Jen.|speech
83|BETH|A perfect record. Wow.|speech
84|MAX|"I don't get what the fuss is. I knew you
and that Chris guy wouldn't last a week
as soon as I saw you together."|speech
85|BETH|"But you can tell with everybody? I don't
know if that's sad or incredible.
9."|speech
86|MAX|"Or incredibly sad. I'm amazed I'm the
only one who can tell. Take any couple.
If it's not incompatible lifestyles, it's
conflicting priorities. If it's not that,
it's usually clashing levels of self-
esteem. It's always something."|speech
87|BETH|"Living with you would be a nightmare. I'd
be afraid to bring any boyfriends home.
Oh, uh, sorry."|speech
88||Awkward pause.|stage direction
89|MAX|"Well, just because I see it, doesn't mean
I talk about it. I don't say a word to my
suitemates."|speech
90|BETH|"You guys never talk about anything
important anyway."|speech
91|MAX|"Oh, come on, we have philosophical
discussions all the time."|speech
92|BETH|"Like whether Voltron could kill the
Transformers?"|speech
93|MAX|"To name one hot-button issue, yes. You
want us to talk about girls? Sam is
nearly married to Jen, Charles doesn't
want his relationships to last, Tommy's
girlfriends are located in online
chatrooms across the country, and Scott,
well... you know."|speech
94|BETH|"For such ""close"" friends, it just seems
weird, that's all. I must admit, I'm a
lot closer to you than any of them."|speech

101|MAX|What?|speech
102|LIBRARIAN|Right this way, then.|speech
103|MAX|"""Reservation""?"|speech
104|LIBRARIAN|"You'd be surprised how many of you
lovebirds we get in here.
She winks and leads them to the elevator. Beth smiles shyly
and looks at Max, but he is merely embarrassed. Her smile
fades."|speech

106|LIBRARIAN|"Max and Beth are watching the opening credits of Annie Hall
on a tiny TV in a cubicle. They are surrounded by other
students in cubicles."|speech
107|BETH|Isn't this great?|speech
108|MAX|"Well, this isn't exactly what I had in
mind."|speech
109|BETH|What do you mean?|speech
110|MAX|"For starters, I have a serious problem
with spending any time in the library
when I don't have to. I'm here once or
twice a year as it is. Plus...
(holds up headphones)
What's the point of seeing this together
if we're wearing headphones?"|speech
111|[MORE]|11.|speech
112|MAX (CONT'D)|"Why not be with a life-sized cardboard
cut-out? That way you can be with someone
famous, even a dead person. Wouldn't you
rather be with Elvis?"|speech
113|BETH|Oh, shhh...!|speech
114|MAX|Or Batman?|speech
115|BETH|Can't you just enjoy the moment?|speech
116|MAX|I'm sorry, I'm sorry.|speech
117|(SIGHS)|"I'm a little nervous. It's like, our
first date and everything."|speech
118|BETH|Oh. Yeah.|speech
119||16 EXT. LIBRARY ­ NIGHT 16|stage direction
120|BETH|"Max and Beth leave the library. Their dispositions have
switched: Max is perky while Beth is subdued."|speech
121|MAX|"I can't believe how many great lines
there are. Even the little throwaways,
like when she parks and he's like,
""That's okay, we can walk to the curb
from here."""|speech
122|BETH|"Yeah. I loved it, I'm serious. I'm so
glad we did this."|speech
123|MAX|Yeah, me too.|speech
124|BETH|"But man, relationships are a lot of work,
aren't they?"|speech
125|MAX|"Uh, sure, sometimes...
Beth stops him, and they sit on a bench. The night is cold.
They sit close and lean in, speaking in hushed tones.
12."|speech
126|BETH|"If I'm going to jump into anything with
you, Max, I need some sign that you're
serious about it. About me."|speech
127|MAX|"What? You want me to get a tattoo or
something?"|speech
128|BETH|"Look, you've gotta admit, you're the most
pessimistic person in the world."|speech
129|MAX|Obviously you've never met my mother.|speech
130|BETH|Can you be serious for a second?|speech
131|MAX|I guess you really haven't met my mother...|speech
132||Beth isn't laughing.|stage direction

134|MAX|Wait a second.|speech
135|BETH|"Okay. No more jokes. Now. Tell me how you
feel."|speech
136|MAX|About what?|speech
137|BETH|About me.|speech
138|MAX|I, I...|speech
139|(EXASPERATED)|"Why are you doing this? Since when have
you gotten ""serious"" about relationships?
Your last boyfriend dumped you after four
days."|speech

141|BETH|"Well, that was intimate. Thanks, Max.
13."|speech
142|MAX|No wait, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, hold on.|speech
143|BETH|"Max, I don't think this is such a good
idea. I mean, it would be really foolish
to jeopardize our friendship."|speech
144|MAX|No, it wouldn't!|speech
145|BETH|"We shouldn't have rushed into this. I'm
sure you know it wouldn't have worked
out."|speech
146|MAX|I don't know that.|speech
147|BETH|"Please tell me we haven't hurt our
friendship. You don't even know how much
you mean to me."|speech
148|MAX|"I'm starting to get the idea.
He's dazed, slightly ill. Beth touches his arm gently and
walks away. Max turns to us. A radio mike swings into view."|speech
149|MAX (CONT'D)|"Things weren't the same after. We quickly
became the kind of friends who say Hi on

Max and Charles walk across the quad towards us. At first,
they are only specks in the distance."|speech
156|CHARLES|Max, you're insane.|speech
157|MAX|"It's ridiculous that even at a liberal
school like this, I have to put up with
anti-Semitism."|speech

you're getting carried away?"|speech

The paper was about my grandparents'
experience in the Holocaust."|speech

night."|speech

Hall you watch, the less successful you
are romantically? I think we'd do much
better if we watched, say, Ocean's 11."|speech

this movie, and then spend the semester
alone."|speech

like a dozen women."|speech

year, and he's in his third year with

occasional freedom."|speech

more than you."|speech

year, we were like Frank and Deano. Now
it's like Frank and freakin' Peter
Lawford."|speech

we share a room and he's like a stranger."|speech

interested."|speech

her, you'll blame me. Me, or Annie Hall."|speech
227|CHARLES|"Look, all I said was, it would explain
our lives."|speech
228|MAX|"The problem is, every crazy theory
explains something. I took a class last
semester with a professor who claimed
that the planet is being destroyed by
white, male, meat-eating capitalists."|speech

230|MAX|"But she had a theory that explained how:
apparently racism, sexism, socialism,
environmentalism, and vegetarianism are

doesn't mind if I'm working while she is.
How's the party?"|speech

this wine and cheese? What kind of party
doesn't even have beer?"|speech

those frat parties. Check out the fox in

homework, and labs, I hardly have time
for anything."|speech

have a lot more free time."|speech

do about Jen. It's a lot of work, but
it's worth it."|speech

still, what could be dumber than changing
your major for a girl?"|speech
244|MAX|Changing your girl for a major.|speech
245|CHARLES|Would you do it?|speech
246|MAX|It wouldn't be an issue.|speech
247|SAM|"Of course not, when has studying ever
interfered with what's important, like
video hockey or your radio show that
nobody listens to."|speech
248|MAX|"I meant, I'd have to have a girl first.
And lay off the radio show. There's a
reason I took the 3am slot."|speech
249|SAM|"And every time I see you doing homework,
you're taking a break. You're the best
I've ever seen when it comes to
procrastinating."|speech

favorite hobbies. Isn't it funny that my
two favorite hobbies rhyme?"|speech

have been worse. For me, that's good."|speech

friend Melanie, who I haven't seen in
ages. Aren't these parties just the best?
So much better than the theater group

want the 18-year-olds to know how mature
they are."|speech

you want. You know the country's in
trouble when a phone sex operator thinks
talking politics is beneath her."|speech

movie.

for years. He's easily threatened."|speech

Chan on his ass, but, you know, my kung-

Kong military."|speech

You're far more interesting.

asking a bear to use toilet paper.
There's this joke that sums it up for me..."|speech

see right through this aloof image."|speech

there's this whole other side of your
personality."|speech

everything off as a joke whenever things

together in high school, but we broke up
over break."|stage direction
795||Since high school, wow.|stage direction

waste of time. Sometimes I, I, I don't

I watch Annie Hall too much."|stage direction

when a character has a chance to say
something, and of course they do, and

people are destined to break up, the will
to stay together is very powerful."|speech

unhappy couples in the world."|speech

special, Max. I mean, we break up with
everyone we ever date... Until the one we
stay with forever."|speech
821|MAX|See how ridiculous dating is?|speech
822|JULIE|"How did you get this attitude if you love
Annie Hall?"|speech

about."|speech

mix of people here, you've got these men

make up for a small dick."|speech

be down at the Porsche dealer with a ski
mask and an Uzi."|speech

849|JULIE|"Max here thinks you're going to break up
with your boyfriend."|speech
850|DONNA|What?|speech
851|MAX|"Sorry. It's all in there. You qualified
""tall"" so as not to make him appear too
handsome, said ""friendly"" like a
euphemism, chose ""fixes cars"" instead of
the more dignified ""auto mechanic,"" and
finally, mentioned his brother á propos
of nothing, like you're threatened by
him."|speech

she turns her back and walks away."|stage direction

our food now. I can't believe you asked
her that.

want to talk to someone, talk to them. I
don't spend my time trying to justify
talking to people or whatever. You limit
yourself if you do that. If you spend too
much time worrying, you don't spend
enough time living, right?"|speech
856|MAX|What are you, a fortune cookie?|speech
857|JULIE|"You have to keep yourself open to
possibilities in life. I'm the first one
in my family to go to college. Sometimes
I can't believe I'm here, at a semi-
prestigious university getting a halfway-
decent education-- this has always been
my dream. How did you end up here?"|speech
858|MAX|I had a coupon.|speech
859|JULIE|"I know what you mean, financial aid is a
bitch. And the university experience
itself is kind of disappointing. All
those rich students with no idea how
lucky they are. But I don't think about
them. I think about me, I think about
where I want to be someday: a world
traveler, running some huge company, or,
you know, doing some fantastically
important work. And when the day comes
that I can relax, I'm going to charter a
boat, sail around the world, and see the
Seven Wonders."|speech

for us to jump, or leap, or whatever, you
know, together. Into a relationship."|speech

relationships are worth it, no matter
what happens.

1408|JULIE|"Are you okay? Will you please calm down?
I like you very much, but I told you, I
just got out of a serious relationship,
and it ended really badly. We saw each
other almost every day at the beginning,
but by the end of the semester, I hadn't
seen him in a month. He stopped returning
my calls and stuff, and I mean, he
basically avoided me, then I heard he was
seeing one of my friends."|speech
1409|MAX|But that was him, not me.|speech
1410|JULIE|"It's nobody's fault, I know. I mean, I've
been trying but it's hard. Relationships
are very difficult to maintain. There are
so few successful couples."|speech

been married thirty years, but--"|speech
