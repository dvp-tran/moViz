OVER BLACK:
KALE (V.O.)
(tense)
Do you think he sees us?
JEFF (V.O.)
No, he can't see us. But he feels
us watching.
FADE IN:
DEEP BLUE WATER FILLS THE FRAME.
And there... a few feet beneath the surface... something
SHIMMERS in the sunlight. As ripples dissipate, we make out
the shape of a bright yellow CRANKBAIT waiting patiently for
its prey on the end of a 10-pound line.
We hold on this for another silent beat... then -- a huge
BLACK BASS suddenly swoops into frame, circling the bait!
ON KALE BRECHT (17) AND HIS DAD, JEFF BRECHT (45)
Both startle at the sight. Kale, a clean-cut all-American
kid, reflexively yanks back on his rod and reel.
KALE
Whoa, did you see that thing?
Kale anxiously winds the spool --
JEFF
Settle down, slow it down...
Jeff lightly puts his hand on Kale's, slowing the cranking
to a slight, steady pull as we WIDEN TO REVEAL them standing
near the stern of their 16-foot BASSMASTER. We are...
1   EXT. BISHOP LAKE - DAY                                           1
The undisturbed beauty of nature serves as our backdrop as
we MOVE CLOSER to Kale and Jeff, taking note of their t-
shirts: Jeff's has a silkscreened cartoon rendition of a
Bass wearing aviator goggles with mounted missiles on its
fins. Beneath it, the slogan: ""Weapons of Bass Destruction.""
The fish on Kale's shirt wears a stock car uniform, a single
word across the bottom: BASSCAR.
As Jeff steadies Kale's hand and pulls away:
JEFF
You don't want to scare him off.
You've got his attention, now just
play with him. Tease him a little.

Kale and Jeff watch the water in anxious silence... Kale
inching the line back toward the boat. One more crank, then --
The BLACK BASS suddenly ATTACKS THE LURE with a tremendous
SLOSH OF HIS TAIL!"|unknown|||
1||"Holy shit!
JEFF
It's all you, Kale, keep cranking!
Kale cranks fast and furious.    But this is one fish that's
going down fighting.
KALE
I need reinforcements!
Jeff moves in, grabs the rod and reel from behind Kale.
JEFF
Heave, laddie!
They PULL.    The rod curls under the weight.
JEFF (CONT'D)
(pirate accent)
Give it all ya got, mate, or you're
gonna lose him!
KALE
(laughing; pulling;
struggling)
Dad, your pirate -- impersonation --
sucks!!
JEFF
How would ya know, have ya ever met
one? I doubt it --
The BASS SLOSHES FURIOUSLY around the bait, now just a few
feet from the boat!
KALE
He's freakin' pulling us in!
JEFF
(laughing)
Never! No Brecht has ever -- lost a
fight -- to a fish!
The BASS suddenly snaps free. The line goes limp. Jeff and
Kale lose their balance, nearly falling backward. Then --

All becomes silent save for Jeff and Kale's heavy breathing.
Kale winds the empty line back to the boat, shoots a glance
to Jeff, then throws the rod aside in mock disgust. Jeff
takes a seat in the captain's chair.
JEFF (CONT'D)
Throw me a --
Kale is already in the cooler. He throws Jeff a Coke.        Both
sit in silence for a beat. Then --
JEFF (CONT'D)
Hey, at least the weather's great...
we're spending quality time together.
KALE
(grabbing pole)
That fish is going down.
JEFF
(not missing a beat)
Let's nab the bastard.
They both cast their lines --
2   EXT. HIGHWAY 395 - NORTHERN SIERRA MOUNTAINS - EVENING                2
An amber glow sets the mountainside ablaze as Jeff's SUV
winds through the serpentine pass.
3   INT. SUV - EVENING - CONTINUOUS - MOVING                              3
Jeff drives.    Kale's on his cell:"|unknown|||
2||"(into phone as needed)
Hey mom, it's us. Listen, fire up
the grill 'cause the Bassmasters are
headed home!
Jeff slaps Kale five as he veers the SUV into the left lane,
passing a slow-moving PATHFINDER...
INTERCUT WITH:
4   INT. KALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS                        4
Kale's attractive mom, JULIE, 40, on cordless, preps dinner.
JULIE
You're kidding. So I can actually
put the burgers away this time?
KALE
Yes, be gone with the red meat!

Julie smiles.    Jeff grabs the phone from Kale.
JEFF
(into phone as needed)
We're having fish for a week.
Kale smiles as a LINCOLN NAVIGATOR PICK-UP zooms past in the
right lane, swerves back in the left lane in front of them.
JEFF (CONT'D)
(over the above)
I'd say an hour. Love you, too.
Jeff flips the phone shut, tosses it to Kale. They exchange
smiles. A silent moment passes. They both turn to face the
road as --
THE NAVIGATOR PICK-UP
suddenly SWERVES back into the right lane, revealing a
STALLED MINI-VAN
directly in front of them!
KALE
DAD --
Jeff instinctively reaches his arm in front of Kale as he
SWINGS the wheel hard right and SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. But
it's not in time. The
SUV
clips the mini-van's right rear bumper, SMASHING it into the
left lane concrete barricade. The SUV spins into the right
lane where that
SLOW-MOVING PATHFINDER
suddenly BROADSIDES IT with such FORCE that it FLIPS the SUV
up and over. It TUMBLES off the highway, barreling into...
5   EXT. VACANT CLIFFSIDE PULLOFF/VIEWING AREA - EVENING - CONT         5
A couple of final, METAL-CRUNCHING FLIPS send the SUV's
undercarriage CRASHING to a violent stop on top of a rickety
wood beam-mounted GUARDRAIL.
A silent beat.    Then -- steam billows from the hood...
6   INSIDE THE SUV                                                      6
Airbags deflate. Dust settles. Blood streams from Jeff's
hairline. His eyes flutter open.

He looks up to Kale, strapped in the passenger seat,
unconscious. A small gash on his forehead. We only see
blue sky through Kale's shattered passenger window."|unknown|||
3||"Kale?   -- Kale, are you okay?
Kale opens his eyes.       Jeff reaches up, touches Kale's face.
KALE
I think so.
Kale looks down at his dad -- his eyes widen in horror, not
only at the sight of Jeff, but of the ravine beneath them --
For this brief moment, we may have thought the SUV was stable.
But we CRANE BACK UP AND OUT KALE'S PASSENGER WINDOW to REVEAL
A MUCH GRIMMER REALITY: the SUV is PERCHED LENGTHWISE ON TOP
OF THE GUARDRAIL AT A 45-DEGREE DOWNWARD ANGLE.
The SUV's right front and rear tires precariously grip the
rail, keeping it from plunging 500 feet to the RAVINE below.
7   BACK INSIDE THE SUV                                                     7
KALE
Oh my God, dad --
-- Jeff's leg is trapped beneath the crumpled dashboard.
JEFF
I'm fine. But you're gonna have to
climb out, Kale. Can you do that?
Kale's hands shake from the SHOCK as his fingers search for
the seatbelt buckle. But the shoulder strap is LOCKED IN
PLACE, preventing Kale from turning. He tugs it furiously.
KALE
I can't -- It won't give --
JEFF
That's okay, I've got it -- grab the
door, I don't need your ass falling
on my face --
Kale reaches up, grips the outside of the door as
JEFF'S HAND
shakily reaches to Kale's seatbelt buckle and presses. Kale's
belt SNAPS LOOSE. Kale's body DROPS, but he hangs on to the
window -- just as a
GUARDRAIL BEAM SNAPS LOOSE FROM ITS FOUNDATION!

The SUV ROCKS VIOLENTLY as the guardrail starts to bend and
peel away from the cliffside under the SUV's weight.
8   INSIDE THE SUV - JEFF                                                    8
reaches up, grabs Kale's legs and pushes, helping Kale climb
out the window.
9   OUTSIDE THE SUV - KALE                                                   9
slowly slides down the outside of the door, then turns around
on his chest, reaches his hand back down to Jeff --
KALE
Dad, here --
Jeff reaches up as a
SECTION OF GUARDRAIL RIVETS
a few inches behind the SUV's rear bumper suddenly POP LOOSE.
THE GUARDRAIL SNAPS IN TWO!
KALE SCREAMS, hangs on for dear life as the GUARDRAIL and
SUV SWING OUT AND OVER THE RAVINE.
The guardrail is buckling fast. Another beam RIPS FREE of
its foundation -- Kale slides a few more inches down the
door and right front fender allowing
HIS FEET
to find the edge of the foundering rail underneath.        Having
at least some footing, Kale reaches back inside --
KALE (CONT'D)
Dad, please, you can do it --
Jeff unbuckles his belt and reaches up. Kale summons his
strength, grabs Jeff's wrist, pulls him up and through the
passenger window just as the
SUV FALLS AWAY!
Jeff's weight pulls Kale down. Kale's feet SLIP off the
rail. Kale SLAMS chest down, his TORSO wrapping around the
top of the rail, feet dangling... But he's still clutching
Jeff's wrist as the SUV CRASHES INTO THE RAVINE IN A MUSHROOM
CLOUD OF DUST AND DEBRIS.
JEFF'S WRIST
slips from Kale's grasp. Kale struggles to hang on, but
he's losing the battle and the balancing act. And he knows
it. Tears well in Kale's eyes.

shakes it off, grabs the speaker wire --

Giles suddenly whips out the letter opener and hurls it like
a THROWING KNIFE at Kale.
The letter opener embeds itself in the back of Kale's thigh.
Kale screams, falls to his knees.
CU - Kale cringes from the pain as Giles, now right behind
him, wraps the SPEAKER WIRE around Kale's NECK and pulls.
Kale grabs for it as Giles chokes the life out of him. Kale
only has one chance. He reaches behind his leg, grabs the
embedded letter opener, RIPS it away, twirls it in his hand

brings up the letter opener.
Kale's eyes widen. He pulls himself to his feet, and sidearms
the racket up at Giles. The racket spins through the air
like a boomerang and miraculously smacks Giles in the hand,
knocking the letter opener away!

Giles enters, kicks Parker's body out of the way and closes
the door. He steps toward Kale as Ashley, from O.S. suddenly
drops the LEAF-SKIMMING NET OVER HIS HEAD and furiously YANKS
Giles back to the floor!
Kale gets to his feet, grabs a vase off the entry hall table

be KICKED HARD in the face by Ashley.
Kale and Ashley TAG TEAM Giles. But Giles finds an opening

STOMPS down on Kale's hand.

kicks the knife away, grabs Kale up, SLAMS him against the
