third reads, ""AMC's 24 Hours of Bond."" No Missed Calls. The
sun is setting and Bond is now Roger Moore - No Missed Calls.

creeping in as Pierce Brosnan does the driving and Kirk is
still awake looking devastated - No Missed Calls.

tired, unshaven, wearing a frumpy sweatsuit. He passes the
magazine rack and something catches his eye. It's a gorgeous
picture of Molly on the cover of Phoenix Entrepreneur

1) Kirk and Molly walk arm in arm through the air show crowd.
Kirk's POV as every guy that passes checks her out. Close on
Kirk's proud expression. The Blue Angels take flight. Close
on the planes as they weave in and out of an intricate
formation. A wider shot reveals that their jet trails spell
out ""MOLLY"" inside a heart. Reverse to pan across Molly
(worried about Kirk's reaction), Kirk (trying not betray his
insecurity) and Stainer (trying to hold back his laughter.)
2) Kirk and Molly in a crowded movie theatre. She squeezes
his hand and he smiles back at her. Molly turns back to the
screen and Kirk's smile quickly degrades into a dirty look.
The shot widens to reveal who Kirk is glaring at - another
man (also with a date) sits on Molly's opposite side and
stares down at her cleavage. The man looks up to meet Kirk's
gaze and smiles back. He offers Kirk a fist-tap behind
Molly's head. Annoyed, Kirk doesn't tap back. Molly is
oblivious to this exchange.
3) As Molly walks down a city sidewalk at night, Kirk has
stopped to tie his shoe. When he trots after her to catch up,
he is tackled by two cops."|stage direction||

shit was following you but we got

1243||"Molly angrily grabs Kirk by the arm and frees him from the
cop's grasp.
4) Kirk, in his TSA uniform, addresses a group of patients at
the Children's Cancer Center. He demonstrates a metal
detector wand. Molly sits with the kids who look bored out
of their minds. Suddenly, the kids light up and Kirk feels
he's making an impression until he realizes that Talon has
come up behind him. Talon is dressed in his flight suit and
carrying an arm-load of toy jets. The kids excitedly jump up
and gather 'round Talon; some even hug him.
