FADE IN:
1   EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT                                1
Autumnal streets seen through the sooty glass of a STREET
LAMP. Shadows within shadows. Fog in the air. Full
moon."|unknown
1|WATSON (V.O.)|"The year was 1891. London was the
capital of the world -- the height
of modernity, with the hiss of
steam and smell of coal in the
air. It was also the great
cesspool into which all the
sinners and criminals of the
empire drained."|speech
2||"Gas hisses audibly, the street lamp ignites, and casts a
POOL OF LIGHT onto the street, silhouetting a MAN making
his way through the fog and dark shadows with a lantern."|unknown
3|WATSON (V.O.)|"I had come to London, ten years
prior, to find a life after the
Afghan war. I had hoped to start
a medical practice and settle into
a nice, steady existence. The
life I found was anything but nice
and steady."|speech
4||"We can see that the MAN wears a cape. The distinctive
silhouette of his deerstalker hat is unmistakable. A
FURIOUS CLATTER OF HOOVES APPROACHES in the distance.
The MAN tugs on a pipe and turns towards the growing
stampede."|unknown
5|WATSON (V.O.)|"And that had everything to do with
one man. My friend, my partner,
my burden..."|speech
6||"The MAN exhales a plume of smoke calmly, giving us the
impression that he knows something that we don't."|unknown
7|WATSON (V.O.)|... Sherlock Holmes.|speech
8||"WHAM! The MAN in the deerstalker hat is KNOCKED FLAT by
A RUNNING MAN who has vaulted over a wall, sending him,
his pipe, and hat flying across the cobbles.

The RUNNING MAN leans down as if to assist, but instead
just picks up the smoker's broken umbrella and studies
it. The MAN in the deerstalker hat's eyes widen as he
recognizes his famous assailant.
MAN
Sherlock Holmes?!
SHERLOCK HOLMES offers the handle of the umbrella to the
MAN, hauls him to his feet and hands back his broken
umbrella.
HOLMES
My apologies. Send the bill to
John Watson, 221B Baker Street.
Sherlock Holmes sprints off down an alleyway.   The MAN
takes a step into the road to watch him go --
-- and is nearly flattened for good by the first of a
number of POLICE CARRIAGES, hurtling by on a serious
pursuit, Victorian-style.

9||INT. CARRIAGE - CLOSEUP ON THE OFFICERS - NIGHT|location
10||"inside. Big, uniformed guys assemble their weaponry -- a
19th century SWAT team. One man stands out as a leader,
older than the rest, INSPECTOR LESTRADE.
A man in plainclothes sits to one side of the officers:
DR. JOHN WATSON, physically as tough as anyone else in
the carriage, but with a more pensive air about him. A
thinking man of action.
3   EXT. STREETS OF LONDON - NIGHT                                   3
Almost tipping over, the carriage turns onto the
Embankment and hurtles through the writhing fog along the
river.
As the carriage banks, we see Holmes cut across the
carriage path again, taking a line the horses cannot
follow.
CUT TO:
ANOTHER ANGLE
Holmes bursts out of an alley, sprints round a corner and
runs across a courtyard to a side door.
WE PULL BACK to see the FACADE OF ST. PAUL'S CATHEDRAL.

5   INT. CATHEDRAL CRYPTS - ENTRANCE - NIGHT                     5
Holmes enters through the door and stands at the top of a
stairwell. He takes a moment to recover; he's fit, but
not as fit as he used to be.
Holmes descends the stairwell to a door and a spiral
staircase beyond it. He stops at the doorway and peers
round the corner.
A lantern glow ascends the spiral stairway towards
Holmes. Holmes withdraws into the shadows behind the
door. A BOWLER-HATTED MAN ascends the stairs, carrying
the lantern and a gun.
He peers behind the door and holds the lantern up to the
shadows, but does not see Holmes, who has pulled his
black jacket up to conceal his face. The man swings the
lantern away again. He peers about, confused.
We see Holmes' eyes from the shadows, as he lowers his
jacket and thinks through his plan of attack.
HOLMES (V.O.)
Head cocked to the left, partial
deafness in right ear. First
point of attack.
PRE-VISUALIZATION IN VARI-SPEED
FOCUS ON the spot behind the man's right ear, just at the
top of the jaw -- the most vulnerable point. Holmes
launches a hammer blow, and we ramp from 24 fps to 400
fps (ULTRA SLOW MOTION) as he makes contact. The man's
head is thrown back as he spins round.
HOLMES (V.O.)
Then throat, paralyze vocal
chords, stop screaming.
BACK TO 24 fps. The man's mouth opens to cry out. We
RAMP BACK UP TO 400 fps as his Adam's Apple is struck
with a precision karate chop, strangling his scream.
HOLMES (V.O.)
Stink of alcohol, heavy drinker --
knuckles to liver.
BACK TO 24 fps, RAMPING TO 400 fps as a devastating
knuckle-punch to the liver doubles up the bowler-hatted
thug and crumples him to his knees.

SECOND-TIME ACTION - SUPER FAST REPEAT OF ABOVE
Holmes flashes out of the shadows, moving so fast that we
can barely see what he's doing.
THWACK! Hammer blow to ear.
CRACK! Karate chop to throat.
WHAP! Knuckle punch to liver.
BACK TO NORMAL MOTION as the man crumples to the ground,
Holmes takes his bowler hat from his head and flips it
onto his own in one super fast move.
Holmes drags the battered man into the shadows, lifts his
lantern and proceeds down the spiral staircase.
POV - BOTTOM OF THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE
Another bowler-hatted THUG approaches the bottom of the
staircase. He has seen the lantern light. He draws his
gun and approaches. Holmes places the lantern on the
post at the bottom of the bannister, ducks down into the
shadows.
THUG
What's goin' on, John?
When he gets no answer, the THUG points his gun to where
we saw Holmes hide.
But Holmes appears from the shadows behind the THUG,
reaches around him, grabs his gun hand and pistol-whips
him twice with his own gun, dropping him.
Holmes extracts a cigar from the Thug's top pocket and
sniffs it appreciatively.
HOLMES
Hhhmm, good cigar. Who do you
work for?
He jams the cigar in his own top pocket, picks up the
man's bowler and proceeds on, further down into the
crypts.

ANOTHER ANGLE
Holmes surveys the scene AT A DISTANCE, out of sight.
Eyes alive with intelligence, processing angles when --
A HEAVY HAND falls on his shoulder.    PULL BACK to
reveal --
(The following exchange in whispers.)
HOLMES
Watson.    Perfect timing.
WATSON
Nice hat.
HOLMES
Just got it.    Where's Lestrade?
WATSON
Getting his troops in formation.
Is that your blood or theirs?
HOLMES
I don't know.    It's an old shirt.
WATSON
You left this behind.
Watson hands him his pistol.    Holmes looks at it with
distaste, doesn't take it.
HOLMES
Knew I'd forgotten something.
Thought I'd left the stove on.
WATSON
You did.
HOLMES
Right.    Shall we?
This is what they do.    This is what they like.

The two HARD MEN on guard turn fast and gather together

13||"Thugs dispatched, Holmes and Watson look down and see a
chilling sight.
A WOMAN IN WHITE LIES INSIDE A CRUDELY-PAINTED PENTACLE
(five-sided figure), lit with candles at each corner.
Her eyes roll back in her head, trance-like. A sword has
been placed at her feet.
A HOODED FIGURE KNEELS INSIDE A DOUBLE CIRCLE next to the
pentacle. This is LORD BLACKWOOD. We do not yet see his
face.
ANOTHER HOODED FIGURE stands on the edge of the ceremony,
shrouded in shadow. We do not see his face.
Suddenly, the woman rises up like a broken puppet, as if
pulled to her feet by invisible hands.
Some kind of ritual is about to climax.
Holmes and Watson head down, fast, not caring if they
make a noise or not. Their footsteps echo."|stage direction

shadows.
Still kneeling, still hooded, Blackwood chants softly,
Latin incantation repeating and repeating.
ON THE WOMAN as her lips start to move in time with the
incantation. This is spooky, real, powerful stuff.
Holmes and Watson leap from the stairs to Blackwood's
level.
Blackwood simply ignores them.   The Latin incantation
never stops.
Holmes is closer to the girl, Watson closer to Blackwood."|stage direction

picks up the sword and turns it on herself, ready to
plunge the point into her heart.
Holmes lunges, grabs the woman's arm, disarms her and
pulls her out of the pentacle. She collapses.
Simultaneously and eerily the candles extinguish and a
rush of air departs the tunnel.
Blackwood throws back his hood. We finally see his face.
His eyes are intense, he is tapped into something dark
and cruel.
Holmes and Watson are shocked at his identity."|stage direction

WATSON
Well done, old man.
-- and Watson goes with her.
Holmes lets the wine drip down over him.
HOLMES
She's lovely.
Holmes is left at an empty table with wine running down
his face.
Their orders arrive -- an array of plates piled high.
The waiter puts them down, Holmes very carefully unfolds
his napkin and places it into the top of his shirt,
spaghetti style, takes his knife and fork and begins to
cut the meat -- then pauses, looks around.
HOLMES' POV
Happy couples eating, laughing, talking. Suddenly,
Holmes hears no words. He just sees their mouths moving.
The sound of silverware clinking and scraping on fine
china rises to an ORCHESTRAL ROAR --
-- which becomes the ROAR of a BLOOD-THIRSTY MOB as a
fist smashes into a face with a MEATY THUD.
15A-17 OMITTEDINT. PUNCH BOWL PUB - BARE-KNUCKLE BOXING FIGHT - 5A-17
1
NIGHT
Holmes staggers back from the blow. He tastes his own
blood from a split lip. It interests him.
He is stripped to the waist, all sinew and gristle. His
opponent, McMURDO -- huge but flabby -- bangs his fists
together and moves in.
Bets rage back and forth through the pressing CROWD.
HOLMES' POV
The room and the fight are calm -- the sounds muffled and
indistinct -- a complete sensory reversal of his
experience in the restaurant. This is soothing to him,
the ring is the only place where his mind stops racing.

15A-17 CONTINUED:                                               15A-17
He's able to feel, not just think.    He is utterly in the
moment.
Holmes' hawk-sharp gaze darts down from McMurdo's face to
his muscles as they flex, giving him just enough warning
to move his head so that a punch grazes him.
BACK TO SCENE
McMurdo throws a storm of punches, most of which Holmes
ducks or blocks. He throws nothing in return, sometimes
even drops his hands, just using his reflexes to protect
himself.
Once or twice, he reaches out and gently touches
McMurdo's face or throat, when the big man leaves an
obvious opening. But that's all. Holmes is completely
in control --
-- until he notices a face at ringside.
CLOSEUP ON A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
Early thirties, a look of pure intrigue in her eyes and a
slight smile on her lips as she watches the detective.
Holmes' POV returns to normal when he sees her, the sound
floods back into the room.
McMurdo senses his opponent's lapse in concentration and
steps on Holmes' foot, tramping him and --
He knocks Holmes down with a thunderous right.
Holmes rolls over, stands, shakes his head to clear the
cobwebs. He looks for the woman. She's gone. He turns
back to McMurdo, smiles.
HOLMES
Well done.   Thank you.
Holmes begins walking away.
McMURDO
Oi!   We ain't done here.
HOLMES
(walking away)
Not done. Finished. And as I
said, thank you, it was most
pleasurable.

Face twisted in disgust, McMurdo strides forward and
SPITS CONTEMPTUOUSLY at Holmes, catching him on the back
of the head. The crowd falls silent.
Holmes stops.     Feels the back of his head, smells his
hand.
HOLMES
Hm.   Plymouth gin.
He turns.   Steps back into the ring.
The crowd applauds, working into a fever pitch, but from
Holmes' POV, all is calm. His eyes tick slowly, scanning
McMurdo, locking onto the big man's knee:
A little scar-tissue, nearly invisible.    As McMurdo
braces for combat --
Instantly Holmes unleashes a series of superfast moves,
incorporating exotic martial arts. The blinding
combination culminates with a spinning kick to the big
man's knee, which buckles altogether wrong.
McMurdo falls, over and out. Holmes is already turning
away before the giant hits the canvas.
He sees the crowd fall silent, they're not sure if they
like it, there really isn't any sport. He doesn't care.
Passing fellow fighters and flirty barmaids, Holmes
strides out of the bar, battered on the outside, soothed
inside. He grabs a bottle in his hand. Taking a huge
swig, he climbs the stairs towards the upstairs rooms.

an overhead railway.
We PUSH IN UNDER the railway arch until we can make out a
splash of white in the shadows -- the Doctor from the
hospital is slumped down against the wall.
We PUSH IN ALL THE WAY, so that we CAN SEE that the
Doctor is actually Holmes.
There is something grotesque about his face, he hasn't
completely removed his disguise. Parts of it hang down,
obscuring him --
-- but not obscuring the light of instability in his
eyes. They begin to overflow with tears. He brushes
them away then looks at his wet hand, horrified.

Holmes enters, disturbed, pained.   Emotions swirling.
He pulls out a newspaper with the story of Standish's
death, the pages and strange sacrificial offerings (bone,
hair, feather, fang) from Sir Thomas' house.
Gathering himself, Holmes stands in the middle of the
bare room and starts to lay out the clues he has on the
floor. The Ox bone directly in front of him (at 12
o'clock). The eagle feather to his right (at 3 o'clock).
The human hair behind him (at 6 o'clock) and the Lion's
fang to his left (at 9 o'clock).
Then with a piece of charcoal Holmes draws a circle
around each image and a circle directly in the center of
the four other circles. He then draws lines which join
the circles together in the shape of a cross.
In the center circle he draws a pentagram (using wax from
a burning candle?). Then he pours a ring of salt around
that circle.
He lights four candles (one at each point of the cross)
then stands in the center of the circle.
He pulls a pocket knife from his coat, opens the blade,
cuts his thumb and allows the drops of blood to drip onto
the ground just outside the circle.

Blackwood enters the maze of tunnels, hears, then sees
Irene sprint across the maze, about 500 yards away.
Then Holmes.
Blackwood follows them.    Sees something on the ground
ahead -- pauses.
It's WATSON'S SWORD STICK, flung there from the previous
action with Dredger.
Blackwood scoops it up.

1390||INT. SINGLE SEWER TUNNEL - DAY|location
1391||"Panting, Irene runs along a tunnel that steps lower --
-- and pinches tighter. A large-diameter water pipe
angles down the tunnel wall, forcing Irene to turn
sideways to continue.
The sound of Holmes' footsteps drives her forward.
And then the tunnel ends. The water pipe breaks off
jaggedly in mid-air, next to Irene's head.
The continuation of the pipe passes through solid brick
at the end of the tunnel -- a dark, claustrophobic
gamble. Irene hesitates for a moment, then slithers into
the pipe, into the unknown.
118D   INT. PIPE - DAY                                            118D
The pipe angles down, damp, horrible. For a long moment
it is pitch black, pinched down. Irene's quick, anxious
breath the only point of reference.
This is as tight, subterranean, dark and nightmarishly
claustrophobic as it gets.
Then, almost imperceptibly, light.
We can make out Irene's determined profile. Light
increases, and so does Irene's rate of movement.

The pipe emerges from the brick wall in what looks to be
the cellar of a building. Stonework fairly new.
Dim daylight from an unseen opening shows a fixed ladder
heading upwards. Irene accelerates for it.
118F   INT. PIPE - DAY                                             118F

An even tighter fit for him.
118G   INT. CELLAR - ON THE LADDER - DAY                           118G
Irene -- climbing with one hand, cylinders in the other --
reaches an iron grate, has to use all her strength to
shoulder it aside. As fit and athletic as she is, this
is a grind.

of construction equipment, and sees, yes --

Gritting her teeth, chest heaving, Irene charges the
stairs --

the inside of the Tower. She's 250 feet above the
Thames.
We've gone straight from maximum claustrophobia to
maximum knee-buckling exposure.
PULL BACK and SWEEP INTO a massive, NEAR 360-DEGREE
HELICOPTER SHOT that starts with Irene at the

-- then shows the skeletal bridge spanned tenuously with
scaffolding --
-- then the glory of London, the center of the world,
laid out for us in breathtaking, spectacular beauty --

darts onto the walkway scaffolding that crosses above the
Thames.

Irene works her way through the construction debris on
the bridge. She makes it to the end, no further to go.
SHERLOCK
Woman!
Sherlock appears behind her, winded.
SHERLOCK
It's bad manners to leave without
at least saying `goodbye.'
Irene turns.
IRENE
Goodbye!
He start to move towards her.     She whips out her gun.

wish things could be different but
you wouldn't believe me anyway.
HOLMES
Why hurry off, give it a try.
He moves in again.   She shoots him in the arm.
And in that split second --
Blackwood drops down from behind Irene, HITS her with
WATSON'S SWORD STICK. She drops, stunned. As she falls,
Blackwood plucks the cylinder out of her hand, and kicks
her gun away. Her gun goes flying off the side of the
bridge. But Irene doesn't pause:
She swings her legs through the air, trying to take out
Blackwood's knees. But he swipes her legs away, and
KICKS DOWN and --
IRENE FALLS OFF THE BRIDGE.

1395||"A look between them and then it's on. Holmes grabs a
short section of wooden batten out of the railing.
Flimsy, no match for the sword --
-- which is immediately apparent as Blackwood comes in,
slashes, chops six inches off the batten.
BLACKWOOD
I planned to kill a handful of
senile old men to make this empire
strong... but now because of you
thousands are going to die.
Holmes is on the defensive throughout, but, as before,
his target is the cylinder first, Blackwood second, self
defense third.
BLACKWOOD
All I have to do is break this
cylinder. The wind will do the
rest. And you'll be the first.
The two men continue their swordfight: Holmes grabs some
rope hanging from the scaffolding above and swings off
the bridge. Blackwood steps to the edge with his sword
out, awaiting Holmes. Holmes swings towards the blade
and then pushes off the bridge once again to avoid it.
Holmes swings back onto the bridge a few feet away from
Blackwood. He lands, whips off his scarf and twirls it
around Blackwood's arm, binding them together. They
continue to spar, now bound.
Blackwood snarls, mounts a frenzied attack, which Holmes
simply tries to survive. The two men finally part, with
Holmes cast off towards the end of the bridge.
Blackwood smiles. He grabs Holmes' gun (which Blackwood
knocked from Irene's hand earlier).
Blackwood fires at Holmes. Holmes quickly ducks. The
bullet misses him, but hits a bucket twirling above his
head. A black liquid (tar) begins to pour out in a
circle around him.
Holmes turns, as if to flee (not that there's anywhere to
go) -- his eyes lock on to something. He looks back to
Blackwood.
-- Holmes kicks a huge scaffolding plank, which falls --
-- whipping a coil of rope across the floor, hooking
Blackwood around his ankle.

Blackwood is DRAGGED down the walkway by the weight of
the falling plank, pulled toward the edge.
Holmes grabs the cylinders as Blackwood passes.
Blackwood digs his fingers into a gap, screeching to a
painful halt. His fingers are white from strain. Holmes
remains cool.
HOLMES
There was never any magic.   Only
conjuring tricks.
Above Holmes:   the raven starts PECKING at a rope.
HOLMES
The simplest involved paying
people off, like the prison
guard...
Holmes looks over the edge of the walkway. He sees the
plank swinging dangerously in the storm. Blackwood
strains desperately to hold on. As Holmes steps closer
we INTERCUT with relevant FLASHBACKS.
HOLMES
(guard choking/
payoff)
Who pretended to be possessed
outside your cell. Your
reputation and your jailers' fear
did the rest.
(burial ground/
licking rocks)
Others required more elaborate
preparation, like the sandstone
slab that covered your tomb. You
had it broken before your burial
then put back together using a
mild adhesive. An ancient
Egyptian recipe I believe -- a
mixture of egg and honey.
Designed to be washed away by the
rain or eaten by animals.
(bath/Reordon
flashback)
Arranging for your father to drown
in his own bathtub required more
modern science. Very clever of
Reordon to find a paralytic that
was activated by the combination
of copper and water and was
therefore undetectable once the
bath water was drained.

That might have been quite
challenging had he not also tested
it on some unfortunate amphibians.
(Standish in rain/
pulling the trigger/
wharf explosion)
The death of Standish was a real
mystery, until you used the same
compound to blow up the wharf. An
odorless, tasteless, flammable
liquid -- yet it burned with an
unusual pinkish hue. Did Standish
mistake it for rain as he entered
your Temple? All it took was a
spark. A simple rigged bullet in
his gun. Ingenious.
(Parliament/flask/
ceremony, dev ice)
Like all great performers you
saved your piece de resistance for
the end. Had it worked, your
followers in Parliament would have
watched unharmed as their
colleagues were dying around them.
They didn't know that you had
given them the antidote -- at one
of your ceremonies I suspect.
Instead, they would have believed
it was magic and that you
harnessed the ultimate power.

Blackwood struggles to hold on, he loses his grip for a
second and is dragged back toward the precipice. Wind
whips harder.
Holmes doesn't notice: The Raven's rope SNAPS, starting
a slow, subtle DOMINO EFFECT IN B.G.: a bucket drops,
hits a row of standing timbers. The timbers start to
topple.
(NOTE: Each time one object strikes another, we hear a
faint musical note moving up the same pentatonic scale
that Holmes played earlier for his flies.)
HOLMES
You hated your father and the
other members of the Temple of the
Four Orders for what they did to
you. How satisfying it must have
been to use their own system
against them.
IN B.G.: We see the slow, inexorable dominoes continue
to fall. The last timber falls over the edge, lands on a
rope. The rope yanks down a crane, the crane swings,
strikes another crane...
BLACKWOOD
Cut me loose, Holmes!
Blackwood's eyes are full of fear. Holmes thoughtfully
looks out at the angry storm, the atmosphere electric and
dangerous. Holmes gives the slightest hint of a smile.
HOLMES
You better hope that it's nothing
more than superstition as you
performed all the rituals
perfectly.
Holmes looks around at the gathering storm.
Blackwood can hold on no longer. He screams as he
releases his grip and is torn down the walkway at
breakneck speed.
Quick as a snake, Holmes grabs a workman's ax placed on
the side and hurls it at his feet, cutting the rope.
Blackwood's imminent death is brought suddenly to a halt.
The storm grows in ferocity. Holmes bends down,
Blackwood is on his knees, cowed.

First, the world will see you for
what you are. Then you will
hang... properly this time.
Blackwood looks up. CRACK! The crane dislodges a METAL
GIRDER, which misses Holmes by inches as it crashes
through the floorboards --
Blackwood smirks.
BLACKWOOD
We'll see about that shall we.
It's a long journey from here to
the rope.
CREAK.   Holmes looks up.    Blackwood looks up.
HOLMES
We'll see about that shall we.
BANG! The top of the crane crashes down. The wooden
infrastructure supporting Blackwood falls away.
Sending Blackwood falling into a lattice of HANGING
CHAINS below. Blackwood screams as the chains begin to
snap off one by one. He falls farther... and farther...
and finally --
SNAP! The last chain CATCHES, TIGHTENS around
Blackwood's neck, killing him instantly.
Blackwood dangles on the rusty chain, hanged like a
common man after all, with Tower Bridge as his gibbet.
Holmes just stands there, stunned. He looks out to see:
the RAVEN flying away, a silhouette against the stormy
sky. The bird flaps its wings, disappearing into a
cloud.
His brow furrows. Perhaps there really are some things
that cannot be explained.
Holmes looks over the side of the bridge, sees:
IRENE is awkwardly splayed on the lower level. She
appears to be dead, possibly a small trickle of blood is
coming out of her mouth. Holmes moves down to her. He
takes her hand.
HOLMES
Oh, Irene...
His fingers move to take her pulse.

Irene makes a quick move: she tries to CUFF him.   But
this time, Holmes is ready for it:
He reverses the move, cuffing her instead.   He takes a
seat next to her.
They sit there for a beat, an odd lovers' moment looking
out over the Thames.
IRENE

Holmes reaches over to grab the key. Their faces close,
near a kiss. Holmes drops the keys down the top of her
shirt (just as she dropped them down his pants). He
snatches the DIAMOND from around her neck, turns and
walks away. She smiles, calls out:
IRENE
You'll miss me, Sherlock.

Sadly, yes.
Holmes walks away, pauses to pick up Watson's sword
stick, keeps walking.

Good afternoon. I was trying to
deduce the manner in which
Blackwood survived his execution.
Clearing your good name, as it
were. But it had a surprisingly
soporific effect and I was carried
off in the arms of Morpheus, like
a caterpillar in a cocoon.
WATSON
Get on with it, Holmes.

Cleverly concealed in the
hangman's knot was a hook -- I
believe my legs have fallen

down.

Watson and Mary walk by.

Holmes tumbles to the ground.
