2||EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE -- DUSK|location
3||"Silence -- complete silence for the urbanite, though the
oncoming darkness is punctuated by the sounds of farm country --
a few birds, a distant rumble of thunder from some heavy
clouds on the horizon, a dog's barking.
CAMERA PANS the green, squared-off flatland, lit only by a
fine sunset in its final throes. Then, gradually, starting
from nothing, a rumble is heard, quickly growing louder and
louder until the sound of a train can be recognized.
CAMERA PANS quickly, discovering the railroad line atop a
man-made rise of land, and the speeding passenger train is
upon us, flashing by with a roar.
Then, as if from nowhere, the figure of a man hits the
embankment and rolls crazily down to the bottom into the
thick underbrush alongside the tracks.
CLOSE SHOT -- BODY
It lies in the bushes, still, unmoving -- dead. CAMERA PANS
AWAY to the quiet peaceful countryside as the sound of the
train fades off until there is silence once more.

6||EXT. MEGEVE -- DAY|location
7||"A handsome and elegant hotel perched on the mountain-side
overlooking the French resort town. A large, open sun deck --
tables, gaily colored parasols, sun bathers.
One of the latter is REGINA LAMPERT, a lovely young girl.
She is, besides taking in the sun, involved in her favorite
activity -- eating.
Then -- a dark, ominous shape intrudes in the f.g. FOCUS
CHANGES to bring into sharp relief a revolver -- shining,
black and ugly in the sunlight.
REGGIE, unaware of her danger, continues to eat.
The finger tightens around the trigger and finally the gun
shoots -- a stream of water arcs, with unerring aim, straight
into REGGIE's face.

was tired of American Provincial,
but that doesn't mean I'm ready for
French Traditional. I loathe the
idea of divorce, Sylvie, but -- if
only Charles had been honest with me --
that's all I ask of anybody -- the
simple truth. But with him, everything
is secrecy and lies. He's hiding
something -- something frightening --
something terrible -- and evil."|speech

74|REGGIE|"No, you see, I don't really love
him."|speech
75|PETER|Well, you're honest, anyway.|speech

dishonesty infuriates me. Like when
you go into a drugstore."|speech
77|PETER|I'm not sure I --|speech
78|REGGIE|"Well, you go in and you ask for some
toothpaste -- the small size -- and
the man brings you the large size.
You tell him you wanted the small
size but he says the large size is
the small size. I always thought the
large size was the largest size, but
he says that the family size, the
economy size and the giant size are
all larger than the large size --
that the large size is the smallest
size there is."|speech

curious."|speech

The short, heavy-set figure of a MAN is outlined against the
bright outdoor light. He stands for a moment, then closes
the door after him. LEOPOLD GIDEON, short-sighted, bald, in
his middle forties, glances around nervously, like a barnyard

GIDEON arrives at the coffin. He stops, looks down at
LAMPERT's body for a moment. Then, suddenly, in rapid
succession, he sneezes six times. He takes a small bottle
from his pocket, shakes a pill from it and swallows it dry.
He turns and walks back up the aisle, looking for a place to
sit. He comes face to face with GRANDPIERRE, stops, turns to
sit somewhere else.

""TEX"" PENTHOLLOW, a slim, rangy man with sandy-colored hair,
a weatherbeaten face, washed-out blue-eyes -- also in his
forties. He wears a velvet-corduroy suit, string tie and a
bright yellow flower in his lapel. A bulldurham tag hangs
from his outside breast pocket, dangling from its string.

Closing the door, we see HERMAN SCOBIE, a heavy-weight --
tall and wide, but not fat -- with black hair combed straight
back and heavy bushy eyebrows of a matching color, which
meet over his nose and join up. About the same age as the
first two men, SCOBIE is dressed in a battered raincoat, his
hands thrust deep in the pockets. He marches down the aisle.
Looking straight ahead, CAMERA PANNING with him. He stops
before the coffin and stares into it.
CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE
As he stares down into the coffin, his tongue trying to
dislodge a bit of food caught in his teeth. He stares hard
at the body, squinting his eyes. Then he removes one hand
from his pocket, removes a pin from the inside of his lapel,
picks his teeth with it, then slowly lets the hand down,
into the coffin.
CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S HAND
The pin held between thumb and forefinger, he jabs it slowly
but positively deep into the back of one of the dead man's
hands. There is no reaction.
CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE
He watches the dead man carefully, still squinting. Then
finally satisfied, he returns the pin to his lapel and walks
back up the aisle and out of the door, slamming it after
him.

shoulder. She jumps in alarm and utters a little cry of

under the chin, held securely against the chest, of each man
at the head of the line. Blowing a whistle, a signal for the
game to begin and the band to play, the men turn to the women
behind them and attempt to transfer the oranges from under
their chins to under the chins of the women -- without using
their hands.
(This maneuver can only be accomplished by embracing one's
partner passionately and firmly pressing the orange against
the partner's throat until he or she can grip it tightly
enough with the chin to turn and offer it to the person next
in line, where the process begins anew. However, the slightest
miscalculation, which can be brought about by any number of
human frailties -- haste, modesty, inhibition or lack of co-
ordination -- will surely result in losing control of the
orange so that it either falls to the floor [where it can
only be picked up by the chin] or it starts to roll and slide
from its proper place to some other, less proper, spot on
the human anatomy, forcing the man or the woman to retrieve
it -- again, with the chin only. This latter is an activity
which can prove extremely satisfying to old friends, or even
new friends who wish to become old friends, but can only be
a torment for total strangers and/or the English).
VARIOUS SHOTS -- ORANGE GAME
Some of the couples in various states of confusion,
entanglement and intimacy -- all of them, naturally,
hilarious.
TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL
It is his turn to take the orange from a very short, but
quite shapely young girl in a strapless dress (held up by an
abundance of cantilever). PETER 'takes' when he sees the
twin obstacles which might -- and probably will -- encumber
the game but increase his worldly experience.
The contest begins: because of her stature he is forced to
move in low, making the ordinary embrace needed for success
difficult, if not impossible. Then, inexorably, the orange
starts to slip down the GIRL's front. Manfully he goes after
it.
CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE
She is enjoying it thoroughly.
TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL
Bending over backwards, in a sort of frontal half-nelson,
PETER makes a last valiant effort and voilà, grips the orange
under his chin -- amid much cheering and congratulations
from members of his TEAM.
Now he turns to REGGIE and they face one another for a moment."|stage direction

possible. Then, for a moment, the game and the onlookers
seem less important than their proximity. But, alas, they
are too good despite themselves and the transfer is
accomplished -- again with appreciative cheers from the TEAM.
REGGIE, with the orange now tucked firmly under her chin,
turns to the next team-member in line and is locked in an
embrace before she realizes her partner is LEOPOLD GIDEON,
the short, fat, balding man seen at the funeral and later in
BARTHOLOMEW's photo.
REGGIE starts to draw back but GIDEON holds her tightly.
Putting his chin around the orange he is able to speak quietly
in REGGIE's ear.

with the side of his palm and the gun falls to the roof.
Following through, DYLE punches the large man full in the
jaw, but instead of falling, SCOBIE wraps his arm around
DYLE, holding on tightly until his head clears.
Then, to his amazement, DYLE is lifted into the air and,
unable to break the bear-hold, carried toward the edge of
the roof. Working his arms between their two bodies, DYLE
suddenly flails them out with all his strength and the hold
is broken, but at the price of his coat and the flesh on his
back as SCOBIE's metal claw rips through both, a wound
extending from the center of DYLE's back to his shoulder.
Both men look around for the gun, spot it simultaneously and
leap for it, both landing short of the mark. Now they grapple
with one another, each trying to break free and reach for
the gun.
CLOSE SHOT -- THEIR HANDS
Two hands, one real, one metal, inch toward the gun.
MED. SHOT -- DYLE AND SCOBIE
The battle is going to SCOBIE whose weight and strength are
beginning to tire DYLE, who is now on his back, trying to
stop SCOBIE from crawling over him. He has the large man by
both lapels of the raincoat in a last-ditch effort to hold
him. But SCOBIE, his face horribly distorted from the strain,
continues to inch forward toward the gun.
Suddenly, DYLE releases his hold. With nothing restraining
him, SCOBIE lurches forward, tumbling past the gun, his
momentum carrying him onto the sloping part of the roof,
where he begins sliding down. SCOBIE beats wildly at the the
slate with his claw, trying to gouge a grip.
CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S CLAW
As it slides across the slate, making a hideous scratching
sound and causing sparks to fly.
MED. SHOT -- SCOBIE
As he slides over the edge and disappears.
CLOSE SHOT -- DYLE
As he watches, hypnotized.
CLOSE SHOT -- ROOF EDGE
There appears to be no sign of SCOBIE. Then CAMERA ZOOMS IN
FOR A TIGHT CLOSE SHOT OF SCOBIE'S metal hand, gripping the
rain gutter at the very edge.
MED. SHOT -- DYLE
Having seen the claw, he rises and walks to the very edge of
the level part of the roof."|stage direction

Her Majesty's delegation has listened

stated, we cannot possibly agree
with its content. In 1937, in the
British colonies of Kenya, Uganda
and Tanganyika -- and, if I'm not
mistaken, more or less in Somaliland --
a programme of crop rotation was
instituted vis-à-vis arable land
which had never before known the
plough, beginning before the soil
was able to know the sort of fatigue
now plaguing most of Western Europe.
In 1937, therefore, Her Majesty's
Government -- at that time His
Majesty's Government -- was able to
properly assay the situation. We
