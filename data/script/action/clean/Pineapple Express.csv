2||"IN BLACK AND WHITE, A black 1930s Cadillac speeds down
the only visible road amidst endless plains of farmland.
The road curves sharply ahead - the car accelerates.
Ignoring the turn, the Caddy drives directly off the road
and through a massive field of emptiness.
The car abruptly stops in the middle of the vacant field.
GENERAL BRAT (58, a patch covers one of his eyes) and
AGENT BLACK SUIT (an agent in a black suit) step out of
the car.
Although there is clearly nothing in sight for miles, the
General scans his surroundings with concern.
