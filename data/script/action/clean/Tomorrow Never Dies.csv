Screenplay by Bruce Feirstein
(for educational purposes only)
FADE IN ON:"|stage direction||
1||EXT. DESOLATE MOUNTAIN RANGE - HIGH ANGLE - DAWN|location||
2||"Super: THE KHYBER PASS, AFGHANISTAN
We're looking down at what used to be called ""The End of the Known
World."" A landscape that is both beautiful, and forbidding.
In the center of this vista, there is a deep ravine.
Pushing in on the ravine, there appears to be a giant icicle hanging
over a cliff:
AN ICE FALL. A 600 foot waterfall whose face is frozen solid.
Pushing in still closer, there is a tiny black dot inching its way up
the ice. A human figure. This is:
JAMES BOND, BRITISH SECRET SERVICE AGENT, 007.
Bond is sweating and straining, four hundred feet in the air. He has
an ice-pick tethered to each hand, ice-cleats on his boots. A black
backpack. As he climbs, spider-like, pulling himself up, he goes to
JAM A CLEAT into the ice, but -
CRACK! A 50 foot stiletto of ice breaks off, CRASHING onto the rocks
below. Regaining his foothold, Bond looks down: Certain death. He
looks up: So very, very, far to go. Bond shakes his head:"|stage direction||
3|BOND|"There has to be an easier way to earn
a living."|speech|BOND|M
4||"Still, Bond climbs. Huffing, sweating, he goes up, and up, until -
ANOTHER ANGLE -
He's 25 feet from the top. He drives a first ice pick in. Gets a
toehold. But when he slams the second pick in -
THE ICE WALL SHATTERS, FALLING AWAY IN FRONT OF HIM. IN THE SHOCK -
BOND LOSES HIS GRIP ON THE FIRST ICE PICK -
And 007 is now dangling, 575 feet in the air, staring at a torrent of
water - hanging only by the leather thread around his wrist, attached
to the first ice-pick, still embedded in the wall.
Bond pauses. Thinks. And coolly begins to swing himself back and
forth, in widening arcs, like a clock's pendulum.
At the high point of his swing, Bond reaches back to smash his other
pick into the ice - BUT MISSES. He looks up at:
THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -
Beginning to work its way out. The tether, fraying.
RETURN ON BOND -
Cautiously, 007 begins to swing a second time. Once. Twice. And on
the third arc, he swings the ice-pick viciously - but MISSES AGAIN.
ANGLE ON THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL -
Now jutting downward, barely holding. The tether is almost totally
frayed through.
RETURN ON BOND -
One last chance. Bond swings. Once. Twice. He reaches back, hurls
himself at the wall, lunging - AND SMASHES THE SECOND PICK INTO THE
ICE... Just as the tether finally snaps on the first one. Still,
he's all but home: He reaches over, grabs the first pick (barely
holding in the ice,) jabs it in, and continues upward."|stage direction||
5||EXT. THE TOP OF THE WATER FALL -|location||
6||"Exhausted, Bond reaches up, over the edge. He drives a pick down -
through the ice, into the hard, flat, ground beneath the waterbed.
As he pulls himself up, (his full weight on the first ice-pick,) he
smashes a second pick through the ice, into the waterbed, and -
THE ENTIRE ICE FALL GIVES WAY -
Breaking off with a groan, tumbling onto the rocks below.
IN THE WATERBED -
A torrent of water crashes over 007. Fighting the oncoming deluge,
he crawls - on his belly - through the water - 25 feet inland.
NEW ANGLE - (TOP OF THE WATER FALL, INLAND)
Bond stands, walks out of the riverbed. He looks back at the cliff:
BOND'S POV - THE WATER FALL -
On either side of the water, there are two small RADAR DISHES, angled
down, scanning every inch of the area, save for the waterfall itself.
In other words: This was the only way in.
RETURN ON BOND -
007 shrugs. From his backpack, he takes out TWO CIGAR-SIZED BLACK
CANISTERS, and an ELONGATED BLACK BOX. He presses a button on the
side of the box, and - fwap, fwap, fwap - SNOW SKIS unfold.
He presses buttons on the canisters: TELESCOPIC SKI POLES. Bond
slaps on the skis, and takes off, through the snow."|stage direction||

EXT. MOUNTAIN CLIFF -"|location||
8||"Bond hurtles over the side, going airborne, landing 100 feet below,
amidst boulders. In perfect Olympic form, he skis out, and down."|stage direction||
9||EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE -|location||
10||"Bond slaloms down, in and out of trees, to avoid detection. At the
bottom, where the snow thins, he comes to:
A ROCK OUTCROPPING.
Hiding behind the rock, Bond takes off his skis, knapsack. He
unpacks (and unfolds) a HIGH TECH AUTOMATIC RIFLE. Puts on a
HEADSET. He creeps up on the rock, and looks out on:
A SECRET MILITARY BASE/AIR STRIP (BOND'S POV)
50 feet down, 200 yards away: 50 MEN are unloading CARGO from a dozen
MILITARY TRANSPORT TRUCKS; there are TWO NORTH KOREAN MiG-29s on the
ground (one partially obscured by a truck,) plus FLATBEDS carrying
HELICOPTERS and SCUD MISSILES.
Near a QUONSET HUT, a TRUCK-MOUNTED RADAR DISH scans the area, with
INFRARED GATLING GUNS mounted on either side.
BOND - AT THE ROCK OUTCROPPING -
Props his rife on the boulder, and peers through the GUN SIGHT.
THROUGH THE TELESCOPIC SIGHT -
He sees a closer (but still wide) telescopic view of men bargaining
over weapons, and forklifts loading/unloading crates of munitions.

Bond SHOVES A KNIFE in the man's ribs, killing him.
Kneeling, Bond takes the pilot's helmet off. He looks up: A MAN is
coming at him with a GUN. In one unbroken move, Bond YANKS THE KNIFE
from the pilot's body and THROWS IT - thwack - into the man's heart.
ANGLE ON MIG-2'S PILOT - WATCHING THIS FROM HIS COCKPIT.
RETURN ON BOND - CLIMBING INTO THE COCKPIT -
Where the COPILOT (having climbed in from the other side,) sees it's
not the right guy. As he fumbles for a weapon, BOND BASHES HIM WITH

Stamper and Thug #2 are pushed to the bottom of the staircase - but
Thug #1 bulls his way up, shouldering through the crowd.
RIALTO BRIDGE - SECOND (DOWN) STAIRCASE - NIGHT
As Bond nears the bottom of the staircase, he looks back up:
THUG #1 is coming down the stairs like an infernal machine, tossing
carnival-goers aside like rag-dolls. Spotting Bond, he charges -
But gets caught between TWO MEN CARRYING A SATIN BANNER. He goes
right through it - ripping the material apart with his bare hands,
pulling the men down, after him.
BASE OF THE RIALTO BRIDGE - CANAL SIDESTREET - NIGHT
Bond turns past the wall at the bottom of the colonnade. He sees:
A GROUP OF TOURISTS, posing for a photo by the bridge -
and just beyond this -
A STREET SELLER hawking souvenirs from a PUSH CART.
BOND approaches the TOURIST with the camera, offering to take the
picture for him."|stage direction||

467|BOND|Grazie -|speech|BOND|M
468||"And heads for the PUSHCART. Wheeling it around, he SHOVES IT at the
thug, who is still stumbling, blinded by the flashbulb.
The CART SLAMS INTO THE MAN, knocking him on his back. The cart
stops on top of him, pinning him down.
BOND takes off, threading through the crowd toward a SIDESTREET.
Meanwhile, THE STREET SELLER rushes to his wrecked cart. It ERUPTS
in the air as Thug #1 jumps to his feet. He's getting really pissed
off. He looks around for Bond - just catching a glimpse of him, as -
007 disappears down the sidestreet.
Thug #1 makes a bee-line for Bond - but finds his path blocked by TWO
MOTORCYCLISTS, chatting away. Barely stopping, Thug #1 lifts one of
the motorcycles - with the driver still in the seat - and THROWS IT
INTO THE CANAL.
RETURN ON THE BASE OF THE BRIDGE -
Stamper and Thug #2 arrive at the wrecked cart - in time to see Thug
#1 disappear onto the side Street.
Stamper motions for Thug #2 to come with him on a parallel course
along the canals toward -
THE PLAZA SAN SALVATORE - NIGHT
Bond enters the deserted plaza from the side-street. Sticking close
to the buildings, he ducks into an alleyway.
ALLEYWAY - OFF THE PLAZA SAN SALVATORE -
Shrinking back into the shadows, Bond peers out into the Plaza.
BOND'S POV - THE PLAZA
Stamper and Thug 2 charge in. Bond watches as they split up and
start looking for him.
RETURN ON BOND - IN THE SHADOWS -
Suddenly, a huge hand grabs 007's shoulder, spinning him around:
THUG #1 has Bond in his grasp, with murder his eyes. In one fast
move, Bond side-steps, ducks, and twists out of the cloak, throwing
it over the Thug's head. And as the Thug struggles to get out from
under it, Bond slams him head-first into a wall, knocking him out.
(He's left sitting upright, slumped against the wall.)
NEW ANGLE -
Bond heads off down the alleyway, away from the Plaza, toward the
courtyard of Il Bovolo.
RETURN ON ALLEYWAY ENTRANCE -
Thug #2 enters, spots the figure in Bond's cloak. Very quietly, he
pulls out his gun, kneels... And as he brings the gun up to the
cloaked figure's head, chambering a round -
The cloak erupts, with Thug #1 viciously biting Thug #2's gun-hand,
hurling him against the opposite wall.
With a frustrated fury, Thug #1 rips off the cloak, and stands."|stage direction||

IL BOVOLO - COURTYARD - NIGHT
Bond enters from the alley, scans the courtyard: Three walls. No
way out... Save for a SPIRAL STAIRCASE that leads up to the FOURTH
FLOOR INTERIOR BALCONY, overlooking the courtyard.
THE SPIRAL STAIRS -
Bond takes the marble steps, two at a time.
RETURN ON THE COURTYARD -
The two Thugs enter the square. Motioning for quiet, they HEAR
BOND'S FOOTFALLS on the steps, and race up after him.
THE BALCONY -
Coming off the staircase, Bond tries the doors to the interior of the
building: Locked. Too heavy to burst in. He glances down at the
courtyard, and HEARS THE THUGS' FOOTSTEPS running up the stairs.
Bond glances up to the roof, just above his head: The only escape.
Pocketing his mask, Bond hops on the BANISTER, REACHES for the
GUTTER. He pulls himself up, throws a leg over - onto the roof, and
disappears from sight...
Just as the Thugs enter the balcony from the staircase.
FIRST ROOFTOP -
Bond scurries along the steeply pitched terra-cotta roof. There are
SHEER DROPS on three sides - but the fourth side is a one-story drop
to an adjoining building. Bond jumps.
SECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP -
007 lands on another steeply pitched roof; unable to get a foothold
on the tiles, he slides down, rolling to the edge. He looks down:
The adjoining building is one story lower, with a skylight roof.
As Bond struggles to climb back to the peak of the second roof -
RETURN ON THE BALCONY -
Thug #1 holsters his gun, and climbs on the banister. He's too heavy
to climb onto the roof by himself - so Thug #2 shoves him from below.
FIRST ROOFTOP -
Thug #1 searches for Bond. He HEARS BOND moving, below him, on the
next building. He makes a running leap.
SECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP -
Bond has hauled himself up to a crouch as Thug #1 lands. They
grapple. The Thug sends Bond sliding down toward the edge of the
roof, then loses his balance, and slides down after Bond.
AT THE EDGE OF THE ROOF, Bond is about to slide off, onto the
skylight below, but GRABS THE COPPER GUTTER at the last moment.
007 is now hanging, fifteen feet above a glass skylight... As Thug #1
tumbles off the edge of the roof, and saves himself by GRABBING ONTO
BOND'S LEGS.
They sway in the air for a second. The GUTTER bends, breaks, and the
two of them fall -
CRASHING THROUGH THE GLASS SKYLIGHT, INTO: -
VENICE MEDIEVAL ARMOR MUSEUM - NIGHT.
They land in a shower of glass on the grand banquet table in the
Great Hall. Bond is winded. Thug #1, unfazed. He grabs Bond by the
collar, hauling him up on his feet.
Thug #1 shoves the nose of his gun under Bond's chin, forcing 007 up
on his toes. Snarling, he thrusts his face menacingly close to Bond:"|stage direction||
472|THUG #1|I owe you some pain.|speech|THUG #1|M
473||"With lightning speed, Bond: 1) Grasps the Thug's elbow and yanks his
gun arm forward, as, 2) Bond pitches his head back. Bond's chin just
clears the barrel as THE GUN FIRES INTO THE CEILING.
The flash momentarily blinds Thug #1. Bond snatches a CANDELABRA,
and smashes it against the Thug's arm, knocking the gun away.
As BOND DRAWS HIS WALTHER, the Thug grabs Bond's wrist, and brutally
(yet effortlessly) SQUEEZES THE GUN from 007's hand, ONTO THE FLOOR.
With a sick smile, the Thug tosses Bond into a corner of the room.
He's having fun.
AS BOND STAGGERS, PICKING HIMSELF UP FROM THE CORNER -
THUG #1 tosses aside a massive table and chairs to get at Bond.
BOND shoves a SUIT OF ARMOR (on wheels) at Thug #1 - who bats it out
of the way, like a gnat.
Concerned this might be getting serious, BOND grabs an OAK LEG from
the shattered table. He wields it like a bat, to ward off the Thug.
Unimpressed, the THUG SMASHES HIS FIST INTO a GLASS DISPLAY TABLE,
and plucks out a CLAYMORE - a two-handed ""King Arthur"" type sword.
With one roundhouse blow, THUG #1 SLICES BOND'S TABLE LEG IN TWO.
The Thug swings the Claymore a second time, forcing Bond back to:
A DISPLAY WALL -
filled with pole weapons. Bond snatches a lethal-looking HALBERD.
(Ax, fluke and spike on a staff.) Thug #1 stops in his tracks.
Drops the Claymore. Grabs a pole-ax.
THE TWO MEN face off in a short, furious battle, which ends with Thug
#1 shattering Bond's Halberd with the pole-ax.
NEW ANGLE -
Gripping the pole-ax horizontally in both hands, Thug #1 forces Bond
backward, to a SECOND DISPLAY WALL that features AN IRON MAIDEN.
(Something like a hinged sarcophagus, lined with spikes.)
Thug #1 tries to push 007 into the case, but Bond side-steps at the
last minute. Thug #1 lurches forward, and is only stopped from
killing himself by the pole-ax hitting the sides of the iron maiden.
As Thug #1 steps back, Bond grabs a MORNING-STAR from the wall. (A
studded iron ball on a chain attached to a club)
Bond swings the Morning-Star down, SNAPPING THUG #1'S POLE-AX IN
TWO... But loses the weapon in the process.
Now, Thug #1 lunges for Bond's throat. Grappling, they slam into the
wall next to the IRON MAIDEN - which is STARTING TO COME LOOSE FROM
THE LEATHER STRAPS holding it upright.  -
In a near death-grip, Bond manages to push/kick/smash Thug #1
backwards, down onto the floor.
AND AS BOND REACHES UP FOR ANOTHER WEAPON - A HAND-AX -
THUG #1 LUNGES FOR BOND'S GUN ON THE FLOOR.
BOND CAN'T GET THE HAND-AX OFF THE WALL. HE TURNS TO SEE:
THUG #1 ABOUT TO SHOOT HIM.
And at the very last second, BOND DISLODGES THE HAND-AX, SLASHES THE
IRON MAIDEN'S LEATHER RETAINING STRAPS and -
NEW ANGLE - FROM INSIDE THE IRON MAIDEN'S POV -
The iron maiden falls forward, impaling Thug #1 on the wooden floor.
RETURN TO SCENE -
The Iron Maiden covers all of Thug #1, except for his arm, still
clutching Bond's gun. Bond bends down and retrieves it."|stage direction||

THE RED BOX.
Quickly, (as the echoes of Harmsway's press conference can be heard
through the portholes,) Bond examines the edges of the box, looking
for tamper-proof seals. Finds none. Gingerly, he opens it:
URANIUM SLUGS. They look like black tennis ball canisters.
BOND presses a button on his watch: THE GEIGER COUNTER CLICKS WILDLY
Bond pauses. Wants to make sure. He spots ANOTHER GEIGER COUNTER on
a bench; he moves its probe over the uranium slugs: Same result.
Bond closes the box. He decides to check out the rest of the room -
examining gadgets, tools, chemicals. HE OPENS A SHALLOW DRAWER -
And finds a set of BLACK ROTARY CUTTING SAWS, WITH ELONGATED TEETH.
(They look almost like a series of sharks' jaws - one oval set inside
another )
Bond lifts one - surprised at its extreme weight. He wonders what it
is used for. Just then -
THERE'S A CLICK AT THE SECOND DOOR. Bond quickly replaces the
cutting saw, moves to the first door -

earlier to meet Harmsway.
The Presses are running full blast; the noise is deafening.
At the ""start"" end of the presses - where the paper is fed in - Bond
sees a GIANT ROLL OF NEWSPRINT on a CRANE, about to be loaded.
Directly beyond this is the door to the elevator/wash-up room where
Bond and Harmsway exited earlier. -
Coming out of that DOOR, Bond sees THREE GUARDS in Harmsway Blazers
carrying guns.
BOND shoots the HOOK on the CRANE CARRYING THE NEWSPRINT ROLL.
It CRASHES TO THE GROUND, rolling backwards on the guards. As they
start scrambling around it -
Bond and Sidney race down the stairs, turning in the opposite direc-
tion (toward the finishing end of the press, near the garage...)
They encounter a GORILLA-SIZED PRESSMAN, with an oversized crowbar.
Bond and the Pressman square off. Bond tries to get around him. The
man lifts his crowbar to smash Bond with it. Bond tries to block the
descending crowbar with his gun - but the crowbar snaps it in half.
Bond and the Pressman engage in a short, furious fight - throwing
each other against the side of the press...
Which ends when Bond finally gets the upper hand for a second, and
pushes the man back, into a pile of INK DRUMS. Momentarily stunned,
Bond forces the man's head into an OPEN INK DRUM -
And as he comes up, COVERED WITH INK, gasping for air, Sidney bops
him on the head with the crowbar.
Now, Bond and Sidney take off, toward the garage/exit -
But one of the Guards (from the crashing roll of newsprint) darts out
from between the banks of the printing press, tripping Bond.
Bond stumbles, face down - then spins over, kicking up at the Guard
as he comes to finish Bond off.
The Guard stumbles backward -
Crashing against a NEWSPAPER BALING MACHINE. (A large machine that
wraps steel or plastic bands around bundles of papers for delivery.)
Rushing the man, Bond struggles with him - and manages to FLIP the
BALING SWITCH - literally tying the man up. The only problem is that
as Bond turns -
The LAST GUARD has Sidney in a choke-hold; he's aiming a gun at Bond.
Seemingly at once, (1) Sidney bites the Guard's forearm, (2) Bond
ducks, (3) the Guard shoots wildly, (4) the gun drops, and (5) -
Bond rushes the man, KNOCKING HIM BACKWARDS INTO THE PRINTING PRESS,
pulling Sidney away at the last moment.
The Guard is sucked up in the press rollers, and...
The pages running through the newsprint web suddenly turn BRIGHT RED."|stage direction||

As Bond grabs the gun, bringing it up to shoot, Yung dives on top of
him. They struggle, and the gun skitters across the floor towards

Breaking free, Bond moves around a console for the gun. Yung takes a
shortcut - leaping on, and then over the console, as -

Chews through the last of the iron bars, and glides through the hole

have squared off in a short, brutal MARTIAL ARTS battle.

reactor core window; the gun, lies on the ground between them.)
They trade punch after punch - and although Bond is holding his own,
Yung is every bit his equal.
Backing off, Bond spins into a crescent kick -
But Yung catches Bond's foot, and shoves Bond backwards, crashing
against a wall near a FIRE EXTINGUISHER.
Meanwhile, all through this...
THE WORM IS GETTING CLOSER TO THE CORE.

As Yung reaches down for the gun, Bond grabs the fire extinguisher
from the wall. He rushes Yung, blasting him with CO2.
In the white smoke, Yung drops the gun... Then CHARGES at Bond,
headbutting him, twisting, and turning 007... SMASHING BOND
BACKWARDS AGAINST THE GLASS WINDOW.
THE WINDOW SHATTERS. Bond is winded. And as he struggles to stop
himself from falling backwards into the reactor room...
Yung does a FLYING, FEET FIRST KICK to finish the job -
But at the last second, BOND DUCKS, reaches up, and uses Yung's
momentum to send him flying over Bond's head into -
THE REACTOR ROOM.
He sails through the air, heading for the cooling pool 20' below, as -
THE WORM CLOSES IN ON THE SILVER REACTOR CORE.
SCREAMING, YUNG HITS THE WATER FEET FIRST, AND -

RETURN ON THE CONTROL ROOM -
Bond races to hit the ""EMERGENCY REACTOR SHUT DOWN"" button. He pulls
a FIRE ALARM, disconnects the worm, and sets off an ""EMERGENCY

Finally, Bond retrieves the gun, and pauses to look down at:

And just when it seems impossible for him to survive - to hold his
breath a second longer -
A FIGURE IN SCUBA GEAR (mask and tank) GRABS HIM.
Bond turns in disbelief. Stares into the mask: IT'S SIDNEY. She
puts her regulator in Bond's mouth...
