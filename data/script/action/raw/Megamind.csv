""UBERMAN - METRO CITY'S HERO AFTER DEFEATING MASTER MIND!

confident smile at the lens. This is UBERMAN, champion of
METRO CITY.
""UBERMAN DEFEATS MASTER MIND'S GIANT ROBOT!""

the collar. The villain blocks his face from the shot with a
METALLIC GAUNTLET.
The images start to flash by even quicker, each showing the
MYSTERIOUS VILLAIN in various stages of humiliation. In each
photograph he successfully blocks his face with his armored
glove.
We ZOOM IN to the last headline.

exact same position.
WE PULL BACK showing him atop a BUILDING overlooking the city

Yet, we can't help but detect a hint of sadness in Uberman's
expression."|stage direction

hall with a GIANT TELESCOPE teems with advanced ELECTRONIC
EQUIPMENT. Computers, monitors and machines which do not have
an obvious function FLASH and HUM.
A STEEL DOOR slides open, revealing the subject of our story
MASTER MIND - a villainous sight to behold. His FACE IS
INEXPLICABLY LIGHT BLUE, topped by an OVERSIZED, MUSHROOM-
SHAPED HEAD with a CIRCULAR PATCH OF WHITE HAIR ON TOP.
He's dressed in the kind of costume only a super villain
could pull off: a PURPLE JUMPSUIT AND BLACK BOOT ENSEMBLE
WITH A GIANT GREEN ""M"" ON THE CHEST. His right hand, hanging
at his side, is a METAL GAUNTLET WITH THREE SHORT SPIKES
PROTRUDING BETWEEN HIS KNUCKLES.
Master Mind begins to survey the room with his TWO
PERMANENTLY ARCHED EYEBROWS.
A man dressed as ALBERT EINSTEIN is busy ranting to two other
men. One, a hulking brute, is dressed as LEONARDO DA VINCI.
The other, a small intellectual-type carrying a clip-board,
is dressed as the philosopher PLATO."|stage direction

see Master Mind walk up behind Einstein.
Einstein notices his colleague's staring over his right

He turns around and Master Mind SEIZES HIM BY HIS THROAT with
his metal gauntlet."|stage direction
20|MASTER MIND|"The real Einstein once said, ""God
does not play dice with the world.""

RITCHI, to the back of the room where Plato and Einstein are
standing guard over a large BLACK SWIVEL-CHAIR facing away
from us.
She pulls free of Da Vinci's grasp and waits for him to undo
the blindfold.
Her face uncovered, we finally see Roxanne's striking
features - all of which seem overshadowed by piercing eyes

just save everybody some heartache
this time by YOU letting me go, and
ME forgetting this whole thing ever
happened?"|speech
43|MASTER MIND|What about my revenge?|speech
