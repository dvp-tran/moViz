1    INT. DERELICT HOUSE - DAY >	1
A POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH, clasped between finger and thumb: a
crude, crime scene flash picture of a MAN'S BODY lying on a
decaying wooden floor, a BLOODY MESS where his head should
be.
The image in the photo starts to FADE as we SUPER TITLES. The
hand holding the photo suddenly FANS it in a rapid FLAPPING
motion, then holds it still. The image fades more, and again
the picture is FANNED.
As TITLES END the image fades to nothing. The hand holding
the photo FLAPS it again, then places it at the front of a
POLAROID CAMERA.
The camera SUCKS the blank picture up, then the FLASH BURSTS.
The Polaroid camera is lowered, revealing the sweaty, heavy-
breathing face of LEONARD (mid-30's). There are droplets of
blood across his face. Leonard stares, satisfied, at
something on the ground in front of him. There is WET BLOOD
on his BLUE SHIRT and BEIGE SUIT. His hand opens and catches
a HANDGUN which leaps up into his grasp.
Still staring, he crouches down and pulls a BODY off the
floor by the wet hair of its BLOODY HEAD. He slowly inserts
the barrel of the gun into the bloody mess where the mouth
should be.
Leonard FLINCHES. A DEAFENING ROAR as wet red leaps off his
face and suit and head, with a SPASM, reassembles itself
into the face of TEDDY (40's, moustache) and we-"|stage direction
