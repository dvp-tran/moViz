recorder in his sport coat jacket.
The door opens on the prisoner side and Mickey Knox is lead into
the room by two SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Mickey's wearing the country
jail blue jump-suit. He has a thick and wide leather belt around
his waist with a metal ring built into each side. Long sturdy
chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body
and through the rings, binding his arms to his sides. His hands
and feet are double cuffed.
The Deputies both have their guns drawn, ready to blow Mickey in
half at the slightest provocation. For a man wrapped and bound
in chains, Mickey seems strangely in control of his environment.
Even restrained as he is by the symbols of society (the chains,
jail, guards, guns, jump-suit), he remains a dangerous,
intimidating, and fascinating figure.
Wayne takes in the image of Mickey."|stage direction

that time has definitely come."|speech
205||(pause)|location
206|WAYNE|"I feel it's apparent to anyone who's
hip to what's going on that the prison
board has thrown the constitution
straight out the fuckin' window.
You and Mallory may be killers, but
you're not insane. You belong in a
prison, not in an asylum. The prison
board is blatantly railroading you into
a hospital for the sole purpose of
turning you into vegetables. Now some
people are saying, 'So what?' I am not
one of those people. If we avert our
eyes while they do this to you, we give
them permission to do it again whenever
they see fit. Today they wipe clean
your mind because they feel your
actions are dangerous, tomorrow they
wipe clean my mind because they feel
what I say is dangerous. Where does
it all stop?"|speech
207||No response from Mickey.|stage direction
208|WAYNE|"My problem Mickey, is that you don't
exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone
on this. I need your help. I want
what the prison board is doing to be
the focus of our follow up episode.
Now I have interviews with chairman of
the prison board Dewight McClusky about
this issue. And I'm tellin' ya,
Mickey, he looks bad. The two
psychologists they used for their
psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk
to us, which always looks bad. I have
an interview with both the judge of
your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the
psychologist and author, Emil
Reinghold, both of which discount the
notion that you're insane. You put
that all together, and what the state
is doing becomes obvious. But the
network isn't satisfied. They feel the
show needs another element. It needs
you. In order to put the show on the
air, I need to get an interview with
you. You haven't talked to the press
since your trial. Now, a few days
before you get transferred to an
asylum, you grant an interview on
television with Wayne Gayle. We're
talkin' a media event here. Every son
of a bitch out the with a TV set's
gonna tune in to see that.
We'll make their motives so blatant,
we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole
thing. At least for a little while,
the publicity would keep them from just
giving you and Mallory lobotomies.
Well, whatta ya say?"|speech
209|MICKEY|Have you talked to Mallory about this?|speech

tremendous job of turning the husband
and wife mass murderers into
celebrities. But it's the country's
youth who have turned the couple into
the ultimate anti-heroes. Basically,
the very thing that makes them most
lethal is the exact same thing that
captures the public's hearts and
minds -- Mickey and Mallory's operatic
devotion to each other. In a world
where people can't seem to make the
simplest relationships work and the
slightest emotional commitment is
considered devastating, Mick and
Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a
Shakespearean magnitude. To the
country's youth, 75 percent of which
are coming from broken homes, that's
appealing. They have an 'us against
the world' posture which always appeals
to youth. And they've taken that
posture seventeen steps beyond.
It's not 'us against the world,' it's
'we're gonna kill the world.' They're
exciting. I read their file and I find
myself turning the page like it was a
paperback. Why do disillusioned youths
get into Mickey and Mallory? Why do
disillusioned housewives read romance
novels? Why are you filming this
special? Because you know as well as I
do, you say 'tonight at nine Charles
Manson speaks,' everybody's going to

worth his robe will tell you the same
thing. It couldn't help but affect my
decision. That's why they have judges.
We're supposed to be fair to a fault,
but when it's showtime, we have to make
a decision. That's why we don't just
input all the facts into a computer for
the appropriate punishment. I couldn't
give them the death penalty. See,
California hops back and forth on that
issue. Mickey and Mallory went to
court when it was out of favor, which
is actually good because it leaves more
room for imagination. Anybody can give
somebody the chair. When you have
someone who deserves to die and you
can't kill them, you have to be
creative. And if the bastards had let
it stand, it would of been the perfect
sentence. It hit 'em right where they
lived. Far more punishing than the
death sentence."|speech

Mickey and Mallory are very unique.
I've seen a lot of killers in my day
and they're a very cold lot. They have
no more feelings about taking a
person's life than squashing a tiny
bug. It's all the same to them. Well,
Mickey and Mallory were that 'kill 'em
to watch their expression change'
attitude personified. Except with each
other. And, since they lived only for
each other, I wanted to attack that, at
its very root. So, in a nutshell, my
sentence was double life for each
without any possibility for parole.
That would be fairly standard in their
case. The twist I added was that the
husband and wife would have no contact
or correspondence with each other for
the rest of their lives. And they
would never receive any word or
information about the other.
So, basically once the cell door slams
shut, Mickey and Mallory will
completely disappear from each other's

other dies. But alas, the best laid

moved 'em around twice since their
sentence started.
They were a handful everywhere they
went. Now the prisons they're at now
want them outta there. But no other
prison's gonna be stupid enough to take
'em. So the prison board is left
scratching their heads wondering what
they're gonna do. Well, what they
decided to do was to set up a kangaroo
medical court that found them crazy.
Then they get them transferred to
Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay
as it's referred to in the psychiatric
circle. Put 'em on a strict dope and
electro shock diet, and Mickey and
Mallory cease to be a problem to
anybody except the orderlies who clean
out the bedpans, which if you want to
see them get theirs, that's all well

said here. Forget the immorality for a
