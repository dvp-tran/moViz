also unrumpled.

THE BOY'S POV
An ox cart is coming down the curving lane. Its driver is
Campbell, with MacClannough walking behind it. The farmers
glance up at William, their faces grim...
From his perch in the loft, William sees that the neighbors
have brought: the bodies of his father and brother. The cart
stops; Campbell, with a bandage around his left hand where
more of his fingers are now missing, studies the back of the
ox, as if it could tell him how to break such news. The butt
of the ox seems to tell him to be matter-of-fact."|stage direction

preparing them. Cloths around the lower jaw and top of the
head bind their mouths shut; pennies cover their eyes.
Softly, William enters the shed, drawn to his father and
brother. Campbell follows him in, wanting to stop him -- but
what can he say now? The undertaker goes on with his work.
William approaches the table; the bodies don't look real to
him. He sees the wounds. The dried blood.
The undertake pours water from a bowl and scrubs off the
blood. But the wounds remain."|stage direction
91||EXT. GRAVESIDE - DAY|location
92||"CLOSE on a grave, with a headstone marked ANNE WALLACE. We
INCLUDE the two new graves freshly dug beside it, and see
the mourners gathered before them. The sight of the boy,
standing alone in front of the graves of his dead mother, as
the bodies of his father and brother are lowered with ropes
into the ground beside her, has all of the neighbors shaken.
The local parish PRIEST drones mechanically in Latin.
The farmers who were secretly gathered in Malcolm Wallace's
kitchen the previous night are now glancing at William; but
no one is anxious to adopt a grieving, a rebellious boy.
Behind MacClannough are his wife and two daughters; his
youngest is barely four, not half William's age; she's a
beautiful girl with long auburn hair, and she clings to her
own mother's hand, as if the open graves are the mouths of
death and might suck her parents in too."|stage direction
93|PRIEST|...Restare in pacem eternis, Amen.|speech
94||"With the final Amen, the neighbors drift from the graveside,
pulling their Children along, to give William a last moment
of private grief before the grave diggers cover the bodies.
The boy stands alone over the open graves, his heart so
shattered that he can scarcely cry; a single tear makes its
way down his face. And the tiny girl feels for William in a
way that the adults cannot. From the ground she pulls a
Scottish thistle, moves to the softly weeping William and
places the beautiful wild blossom in his hand.
William looks up and their young eyes meet; her sad blue
eyes hold William's as the grave diggers cover the bodies.
Then a lone, mounted figure appears at the crest of the hill
above them. Tall, thin and angular, in black clerical garb,
he looks like the grim reaper.
The girl hurries back to her mother's side; everyone watches
in silence as the figure rides down to them. He is ARGYLE
WALLACE. He looks like a human buzzard, his face craggy,
permanently furious."|stage direction

deceased... William, this is your
Uncle Argyle."|speech

what it means in England as well?"|speech

at the garish, hanged faces in his nightmare. Then a mangled
hand comes from behind him and grasps his shoulder, William
gasps, but the hand holds him gently. He turns to see his
father, and his brother! They are wounded, bloody, but they
smile at him; they're alive! Weeping in joy, William reaches
to hug them, but his father stretches forth a forbidding
hand.
William keeps reaching out helplessly. His father and brother
move past him to the hanged knights. Two empty nooses are
there. Before the boy's weeping eyes they put their heads
into the nooses, and hoist themselves up.
William's grief explodes; his tears erupt and

But his uncle is not there either. Then William hears a
strange, haunting sound-distant, carried by the wind. He

Scottish dirge, a tune of grief and redemption, a melody
known to us as ""Amazing Grace."" Uncle Argyle has heard them

221||"Flutes and dancing; laughter and garlands; village families
have gathered for a wedding celebration -- we see the happy
bride and groom. Farmers cart in fresh bread and hoops of
cheese; villagers arrive with casks of beer or strings of
smoked fish.
And watching the people are ubiquitous English soldiers,
battlescarred veterans with missing eyes and ears.
Riding along the road comes William Wallace. Grown now, a
man. He sits his horse as if born there, his back straight,
his hands relaxed on the reins. He has a look of lean, rippled
power. He looks dangerous.
And the soldiers notice him, nudging each other as he passes.
He carries a dead wild goose hanging across his saddle; he
stops his horse at the edge of the clearing and surveys the
scene. Farmers are roasting a pig; women are comparing
handiwork; young men are tossing huge stones in the
traditional Highland games -- and everyone is noticing
William's arrival, especially the farm women with daughters
of marriageable age.
Among those watching William arrive is Campbell, grown older
now; and with his old rebel friend, MacClannough. William
dismounts and ties his horse to a willow. One of the English
SOLDIERS shoves William from behind."|stage direction

Slowly, William picks it up, and heads into the clearing.
The farmers watch him come.
Among those noticing William's arrival, but pretending not
to, is MARION MacCLANNOUGH, grown now into a stunning young
woman; her long auburn hair reminds us of those years long
ago; she wears it the same way, straight and full down her
back. Her dress is plain, like the grass that surrounds a
wildflower. She's the most beautiful girl in the village,
maybe in all of Scotland, and the soldiers who hassled William
notice her too.
William reaches the food table and contributes his goose to
the feast. FARM WOMEN eye him; he nodes to one."|stage direction

He moves away from the table, passing through the crowd like
a stranger. Then he glances toward the knot of girls. He
sees Marion. She sees him, then looks away. Do they remember
each other? He moves toward her; she is shy, her eyes
downcast, but then she raises them and looks at him.
They move closer and closer together. Just as they are about
to reach each other, a huge round stone THUMPS to the earth
at Williams' feet.
He looks up to see one of Marion's suitors -- the broad,
muscled young man who has just tossed the stone in William's

bows; the arrows WHISH toward the lens, fly past...
The arrows tear through Wallace's clothes, but don't catch
his flesh. He charges on; his horse LEAPS the barrier as
Wallace simultaneously swings the broadsword -- and he's
more than an expert: the tip, at the end of a huge arc, nearly
breaks the sound barrier and the blade bites through the
corporal's helmet, taking off the upper half of his head!
The soldiers try to rally, to shoot him in the back as his
horse leaps over them. One of them has sighted William's
back... But Hamish and his father crash into them! It's a
wild fight; old Campbell takes an arrow through the shoulder
but keeps hacking with his sword; Hamish batters down two
men -- and more Scots arrive! They overwhelm the soldiers.
WALLACE RACES THROUGH THE VILLAGE - FAVORING HIS POV
He dodges obstacles in the narrow streets -- chickens, carts,
barrels. Soldiers pop up; the first he gallops straight over;
the next he whacks forehand, like a polo player; the next
chops down on his left side; every time he swings the

THE CAVALRY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE
The English knights see the signal banners, telling them to
attack. They take the lances from their squires, and lower
the visors of their helmets. Proud, plumed, glimmering; they
look invincible. Their huge horses, themselves draped in
scarlet and purple, look like tanks. The knights charge!
Their hooves THUNDER; the horses are so heavy the ground
literally shakes with the charge.
The Scots stand and watch them come on. It's difficult to
imagine the courage this takes; from the POV OF THE SCOTTISH
LINES we see the massive horses boring in... we feel the
RISING THUNDER of the charge, closer, closer...
Wallace moves to the front of the lead group of Scots."|stage direction

line of men bracing their spears at an angle three feet above
the ground, the men behind them bracing theirs at a five
foot level, the men behind that bracing at seven feet.
The English knights have never seen such a formation. Their
lances are useless and it's too late to stop! The momentum
that was to carry the horses smashing through the men on
foot now becomes suicidal force; knights and horses impale
themselves on the long spears like beef on skewers.
TALMADGE
can see it; but worse is the SOUND, the SCREAMS OF DYING MEN
AND HORSES, carried to him across the battlefield.
WALLACE AND HIS MEN
are protected, behind a literal wall of fallen chargers and
knights. Wallace draws his broadsword and leads his swordsmen
out onto the field, attacking the knights that are still
alive. Most are off their horses; a few have managed to pull
up their mounts. Wallace and his men are so much more mobile
than the knights; the field runs with blood.

the Scots are carving their way through the English soldiers;
nothing can stop them. Wallace is relentless; each time he
swings, a head flies, or an arm. Hamish and Stephen fight
beside him, swinging the broadsword with both hands. Old
Campbell loses his shield in the grappling; an English
swordsman whacks at him and takes off his left hand, but
Campbell batters him to the ground with his right, and stabs
him. Reaching the English side of the bridge, the Scots begin
to build a barrier with the dead bodies.
The English are not without courage. Cheltham leads a
desperate counterattack. The Scots make an impenetrable
barrier of slashing blades. Still Cheltham keeps coming;
Wallace hits him with a vertical slash that parts his helmet,

William is relieved -- and yet as he sees the Princess more
closely he is still shaken by the resemblance in the way she
carries herself, her shape, the fall of her hair.

Scottish handlers run toward the English ranks and unleash
the dogs, fear races through the English line.
The dogs tear into them. It is chaos; the bowmen can't flee,

mostly hitting each other. The dogs' collars slash legs;
their jaws crush bones; even when their back legs are hacked

weaves through them, dodging with his horse, slashing with

Scottish charge bearing down on them and adjust their aim;

Hamish reaches the rear of the battle and lowers the limp
body of his father to the Scottish monks who are attending
to the wounded and giving absolution to the dying...
Still Wallace fights back, meeting the English charge. The
Scots hold their own. An English knight tries to ride over
William; he knocks the lance aside, and tough the horse slams
into him, William also unseats the rider.
The rider rolls to his feet. William struggles up to meet
him -- and comes face to face with Robert the Bruce.
The shock and recognition stun Wallace; in that moment,
looking at Robert the Bruce's guilt-ridden face, he
understands everything: the betrayal, the hopelessness of
Scotland. As he stands there frozen, a bolt punches into the
muscle of his neck, and Wallace doesn't react to it.

slaughtered. Another bolt glances off Wallace's helmet; a
third rips into his thigh plate, making his legs collapse.
Suddenly Stephen comes through the melee, on Robert's horse!
He hits Robert from behind, knocking him down, and jumps to
the ground to try and lift William onto the horse!
Robert sees a knot of crossbowmen moving up, sighting out
Wallace, taking careful aim! Bruce leaps up and helps Stephen
sling Wallace onto the back of the horse, even covers him
with his shield, deflecting another bolt fired at Wallace,
as Stephen mounts too.
As the horse plunges away into the smoke, Robert falls to
the water. His own troops reach him, realize who he is, see
the horrible expression on his face, and race on after the
Scots.
Robert is left alone, on his knees in the water, the fire
and noise of battle now dim to him, as if his senses have
died along with his heart.

from barrels. Royal horsemen arrive, dragging Wallace strapped
to a wooden litter. As they cut him loose and lead him through
the crowd, the people begin to jeer and throw things at him:
chicken bones, rocks, empty tankards.
We see a former English soldier, one of those who fled in
terror at the battle of Stirling, lift a stone from the street
and hurl it; it cracks against Wallace's cheek.
Wallace's eyes capture the soldier, and hold him, piercing
his soul. The soldier looks away in shame, even as the rest
of the crowd jeers more.
Grim magistrates prod Wallace and he climbs the execution
platform. On the platform are a noose, a dissection table
with knives in plain view, and a chopping block with an
enormous axe. Wallace sees it all."|stage direction

over. Or fall to your knees now,
declare yourself the king's loyal
subject, and beg his mercy, and you
shall have it."|speech

pale, and trebles -- but he shakes his head. The CROWD grows
noisier as they put the noose around Wallace's neck...
WE INTERCUT:
-- THE PRINCESS, in helpless agony, hearing the DISTANT NOISE
from her room in the palace...
-- Hamish and Stephen, disguised as peasants among the crowd,
helpless too, but there, as if to shoulder some of the pain.
-- Longshanks, rattling, coughing blood, as Edward watches.
-- Robert the Bruce paces along the walls of his castle in
Scotland. His eyes are haunted; he grips the embroidered
handkerchief that belonged to Wallace.

Wallace's neck and hoist him up a pole."|stage direction

too far, he prolongs the moment; then the Magistrate nods
and the executioner cuts the rope. Wallace slams to the
platform; the Magistrate leans to him."|stage direction

kiss the royal emblem on my cloak,

Wallace struggles all the way to his feet."|stage direction

1272||"The executioners slam Wallace onto his back on the table,
spread his arms and legs, and tie each to a crank. Goaded by
the crowd, they pull the ropes taut. They crowd grows quiet
enough to hear the groaning of Wallace's limbs. Hamish and
Stephen feel it in their own bodies."|stage direction

remains conscious through such pain.
Enough?"|speech

Wallace wants to say something."|stage direction

Rebuffed, the Magistrate nods to the executioners, who lift
the terrible instruments of dissection.

him."|stage direction

wind could carry it through the ends of Scotland; and Robert
the Bruce, on the walls of his castle, looks up sharply, as
if he has heard...
IN THE LONDON SQUARE
the crowd has never seen courage like this; even English
strangers begin to weep. The angry, defeated magistrate gives
a signal. They cut the ropes, drag Wallace over and put his
head on the block. The executioner lifts his huge axe -- and
Wallace looks toward the crowd.
