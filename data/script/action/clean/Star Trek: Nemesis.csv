finding its way heroically through the cold manipulation of
science.
CREDITS as we see a beautiful montage of futuristic medical
technology.  Through a microscope we see cells multiplying

of exploding flowers.  We see laser splicing and biological
manipulation on the molecular level.

lean together and talk seriously.  Their hushed, urgent tones
denote the gravity of their discussion.
We can't make out the words but there is no doubt what they
are talking about.
The three year old HUMAN BOY who stands before them.  The boy
is alone and frightened, lost in the sweeping grandeur of
the massive chamber.

On a stark, desert planet with monolithic mountains and harsh
crags shooting upward.  The only light in this dark
netherworld comes from the flames that accompany the hellish
mining operations everywhere around us.
The human boy gazes over this desolate vista and then he
looks up for a moment... at the stars.
Then a tall figure leads him firmly into one of the mines.
The boy seems to disappear into this flaming crucible.

11||"SENATOR TAL'AURA watches the proceedings with a studied look
of bored indifference.  She glances to the familiar Romulan
crest that dominates one wall of the chamber: a ferocious
bird-of-prey holding two planets, one in either claw.
And then her eyes carefully cross the chamber to...
PRAETOR HIREN -- the head of the Romulan government --
presiding over the Senate from a throne-like chair.  He is a
capable politician in his 50s."|stage direction|||
12|SENATOR 1|"... but if we hesitate we'll lose
this important source of dilithium.

the motion."|speech|PRAETOR|M|

""diplomatic"" overtures.  But if you
will excuse me, Praetor, I have an
appointment with the Tholian
ambassador."|speech|TAL'AURA|F|
17||"The Praetor nods.  Tal'Aura stands and leaves the chamber...
but she had left something behind on her desk.  A small,
silver box with unusual etchings on the surface.

motion to open trade negotiations
with Celes II..."|speech|PRAETOR|M|
19||"The Senator at the desk next to Tal'Aura's glances over.  The
silver box is moving.
The Senator watches, amazed, as the box begins to slowly fold
open.  Then ""legs"" appear.  The box unfolds like a spider,
standing on its legs.  Then it is still for a moment.  The
Senator looks at it, puzzled.
Suddenly -- a bright beam of green light shoots up from the
spider -- the Senators are stunned -- the beam shoots to the
high domed ceiling of the chamber and then cascades around
the interior of the room, enveloping everything in a glowing
shroud of green energy.  In a way, it is bizarrely beautiful.
And then just as suddenly the light disappears.
A moment of silence.  The Praetor and Senators are baffled."|stage direction|||

confluence of emotion at the
wedding.  I am familiar with the
human concept of tears through
laughter and its inverse, laughter
through tears, but I could not help
wondering about the human capacity
for expressing both pleasure and
sadness simultaneously."|speech|DATA|M|True
109|PICARD|"I understand why it would seem
confusing.  Certain human rituals --
like weddings, birthdays or
funerals evoke strong and very
complex emotions.  These rites
carry great weight with us because
they denote the passage of time."|speech|PICARD|M|True

predict specific reactions and

that knowledge."|speech|DATA|M|True

well.  They've made important
choices; they're going to have
great challenges ahead of them.

me think about some of the choices

choices that led me here."|speech|PICARD|M|True

own.  Data looks at him; he has
never really considered this."|speech|PICARD|M|True
