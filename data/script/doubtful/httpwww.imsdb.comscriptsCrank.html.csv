EXTREME CU: RED GHOST transforms into BLUE GHOST, changes
direction and runs. PACMAN chases ...
P.. but just before he catches up the BLUE GHOST transforms
back to RED and changes direction again. PACMAN barely
escapes.
CUT TO:
PACMAN flees, but at every turn he is confronted by another
ghost. The CAMERA pulls out in a series of jump cuts to
reveal that unlike the old arcade game, this game screen goes
E forever, an infinite maze ... and instead of the original
on four there are thousands of ghosts at all sides, closing in.
The sound of the game redoubles, reverberates, deafening ...
CUT TO BLACK.
SOUND: A HEART BEATS SLOWLY IN THE DARK.
