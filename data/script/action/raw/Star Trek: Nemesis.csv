finding its way heroically through the cold manipulation of
science.
CREDITS as we see a beautiful montage of futuristic medical
technology.  Through a microscope we see cells multiplying

of exploding flowers.  We see laser splicing and biological
manipulation on the molecular level.

lean together and talk seriously.  Their hushed, urgent tones
denote the gravity of their discussion.
We can't make out the words but there is no doubt what they
are talking about.
The three year old HUMAN BOY who stands before them.  The boy
is alone and frightened, lost in the sweeping grandeur of
the massive chamber.

On a stark, desert planet with monolithic mountains and harsh
crags shooting upward.  The only light in this dark
netherworld comes from the flames that accompany the hellish
mining operations everywhere around us.
The human boy gazes over this desolate vista and then he
looks up for a moment... at the stars.
Then a tall figure leads him firmly into one of the mines.
The boy seems to disappear into this flaming crucible.

We slowly move down toward the most imposing building of the
city.  The Romulan Senate chamber."|stage direction
10||INT.  ROMULAN SENATE CHAMBER - SUNSET|location
11||"SENATOR TAL'AURA watches the proceedings with a studied look
of bored indifference.  She glances to the familiar Romulan
crest that dominates one wall of the chamber: a ferocious
bird-of-prey holding two planets, one in either claw.
And then her eyes carefully cross the chamber to...
PRAETOR HIREN -- the head of the Romulan government --
presiding over the Senate from a throne-like chair.  He is a
capable politician in his 50s."|stage direction
12|SENATOR 1|"... but if we hesitate we'll lose
this important source of dilithium.
A trade agreement is in the best
interests of the Empire."|speech

diplomatic mission to Celes II to
open negotiations."|speech

Praetor Hiren glances to her."|stage direction
15|PRAETOR|"Senator Tal'Aura, you disagree with
the motion."|speech
16|TAL'AURA|"No, sir.  I would say ""negotiation""
is to be advised.  I support all
""diplomatic"" overtures.  But if you
will excuse me, Praetor, I have an
appointment with the Tholian
ambassador."|speech
17||"The Praetor nods.  Tal'Aura stands and leaves the chamber...
but she had left something behind on her desk.  A small,
silver box with unusual etchings on the surface.
The discussion continues as we focus on the silver box..."|stage direction
18|PRAETOR|"Then I will call for a vote on the
motion to open trade negotiations
with Celes II..."|speech
19||"The Senator at the desk next to Tal'Aura's glances over.  The
silver box is moving.
The Senator watches, amazed, as the box begins to slowly fold
open.  Then ""legs"" appear.  The box unfolds like a spider,
standing on its legs.  Then it is still for a moment.  The
Senator looks at it, puzzled.
Suddenly -- a bright beam of green light shoots up from the
spider -- the Senators are stunned -- the beam shoots to the
high domed ceiling of the chamber and then cascades around
the interior of the room, enveloping everything in a glowing
shroud of green energy.  In a way, it is bizarrely beautiful.
And then just as suddenly the light disappears.
A moment of silence.  The Praetor and Senators are baffled."|stage direction

that was?"|speech

Every bit of organic matter in the chamber decays.  Flesh
melts from bones while the Senators scream in agony.  Every

A stunning moment of silence as we take in the carnage.  Then
a transporter effect ripples around the spider-weapon.  It

28|PICARD|Duty...|speech
29||He lets the word resonate and then continues.|stage direction
30|PICARD|"A starship captain's life is filled
with solemn duty.  I have commanded
men in battle.  I have negotiated
peace treaties between implacable
enemies.  I have represented the
Federation in first contact with
twenty-seven alien species.  But
none of this compares to my solemn
duty as... Best man."|speech

reception of WILL RIKER and DEANNA TROI.
The Enterprise CREW is gathered with invited GUESTS, some
from other ""Star Trek"" series.  Riker and Deanna sit at the
center of a long table."|stage direction
32|PICARD|"Now, I know that on an occasion
such as this: it is expected that I
be gracious and fulsome with praise
on the wonders of this blessed
union... But have you two
considered what you're doing to?
This is all a damned
inconvenience..."|speech
33||(laughter from the crowd)|location
34|PICARD|"While you're happily settling in on
the Titan, I'll have to train a new
first officer; no doubt a stern
martinet who'll quote the rule book
at me and never... ever... allow me
to go on away missions."|speech
35||(laughter)|location
36|PICARD|"... Then there's the matter of my
new counselor.  Undoubtedly some
soft-spoken, willowy thing who'll
be probing into my darkest psyche

sympathetically.  Isn't that right,
Deanna?"|speech
37||"Deanna nods her head and coos sympathetically.  Hearty,
wonderful LAUGHTER!"|stage direction
38|PICARD|"I notice Dr. Crusher laughing along
with the rest of you.  As most of
you know, the doctor will also soon
be leaving the Enterprise, to
assume command of Starfleet
Medical.  Again, I'm forced to ask,
Beverly, have you considered what
you're doing to little ole' me?!
I'll probably get some old battle-
axe of a doctor who'll tell me to
eat my vegetables and put me on
report if I don't show up for my
physical on time!"|speech
39|BEVERLY|It'll serve you right.|speech

reconsider.  No?  Very well then..."|speech
42||He smiles and raises his glass, looks at them deeply.|stage direction
43|PICARD|"Will Riker, you have been my
trusted right arm for fourteen
years; you have helped keep my
course true and steady.  Deanna
Troi, you have been my conscience

the better parts of myself.  You
are my family.  And in proper

nostalgic.  Maybe he's getting soft
in his old age."|speech

new Series Four replicators, he
tried to order his usual tea and
there was a glitch.  Had us remove
the whole bunch of them and put the
old ones back in."|speech

replicators."|speech

likes them..."|speech

Picard and Beverly."|stage direction

toast."|speech

I'm a talking head."|speech

your new counselor on everything
she needs to know."|speech

much about me as it is... Now you
promised there are no speeches

Tran gendered species... In my
study of Terran and Betazoid

confluence of emotion at the
wedding.  I am familiar with the
human concept of tears through
laughter and its inverse, laughter
through tears, but I could not help
wondering about the human capacity
for expressing both pleasure and
sadness simultaneously."|speech
109|PICARD|"I understand why it would seem
confusing.  Certain human rituals --
like weddings, birthdays or
funerals evoke strong and very
complex emotions.  These rites
carry great weight with us because
they denote the passage of time."|speech
110|DATA|"And you were particularly aware of
this feeling because Commander
Riker will be leaving to assume
command of the Titan?"|speech

Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet
Medical..."|speech
112|DATA|"And this makes you ""sad""?"|speech

I'm very happy for them, of course,
but I'm going to miss them.  The
ship will seem... incomplete
without them."|speech
114|DATA|"That is because you have a
familiarity with them.  You can
predict specific reactions and
behavior and are comfortable in
that knowledge."|speech
115|PICARD|"Yes.  And, frankly, I envy them as
well.  They've made important
choices; they're going to have
great challenges ahead of them.
New worlds to conquer..."|speech
116||He takes another sip of wine.  A beat.|stage direction
117|PICARD|"Seeing Will and Deanna today made
me think about some of the choices
I've made in my own life.  Devoting
myself to Starfleet... Not marrying
or having children... All the
choices that led me here."|speech
118||A beat.  Data thinks about it.|stage direction
119|DATA|"The choices I made have led me here
as well.  This is the only home I
have ever known.  I cannot foresee
a reason for leaving."|speech
120|PICARD|"You never know what's over the
horizon, Data.  Before too long
you'll be offered a command of your
own.  Data looks at him; he has
never really considered this."|speech
121|DATA|"If I were... I believe my memory
engrams would sense the absence of
your specific reactions and
behavior.  I would ""miss you."""|speech
