2||"CREDITS OVER: a magical fairy tale world in collage - images
of fantastic creatures striped and spotted, hoofed and
horned.
Goats and warthogs mingle in an open field; a baby giraffe
tries to reach leaves over a fence; rhinos roll happily in
rich red mud, looking like giant muddy boulders, while
nearby, black and white Malayan tapirs cool themselves in
watering holes.
Exotic monkeys with comical faces cling lovingly to one
another, swing from trees, climb over one another, prance and
screech; a probiscus monkey with a 'Jimmy Durante' nose
pointing out through the plane of the screen. Flamingoes
strut about in the aviary, their pink feathers reflected in
the water.
A sloth droops lazily from a tree branch, unfazed, while a
nearby hummingbird zips manically from flower to flower like
Tinkerbell...
... the Pondicherry zoo is a children's paradise nestled in a
botanical garden.

Born and raised in Pondicherry, in
what was the French part of India.
My father owned the zoo, and I was
delivered on short notice by a
herpetologist who was there to
check on the Bengal Monitor Lizard.
The zoo owner (FATHER - late 20s) hurries down the path as
quickly as his heavy leg brace will allow and hurries into
the animal clinic.

French Canadian), watches Pi.
ADULT PI
The way of karma; the way of God.
WRITER
I assumed your father was a
mathematician - because of your
name.
ADULT PI
Oh, far from it. I was named after
a swimming pool.
WRITER
There's a swimming pool named 'Pi?'
ADULT PI
(He chuckles.)
You see, my uncle, Francis, was
born with too much water in his
lungs. They say the doctor swung
Francis around by the ankles to
clear the water out and that's what
gave him the huge chest and skinny
legs that made him such a great
swimmer.
WRITER
(Amused.)
Is Francis actually your uncle? He
said he was friends with your
father.

I call him 'Mamaji,' my 'honorary

Richard Parker becomes totally absorbed in the kill, leaping,

Carnivorous? Like... a Venus

Yes, the whole island - the plants,
the water in those pools, the very
ground itself. During the day,
those pools held fresh water, but
at night, some chemical process
turned the water in those pools
into acid - acid that dissolved
those fish, that sent the meerkats
scurrying into the trees and
Richard Parker running to the boat.

Years ago, some poor fellow just

threw her body overboard. Then the
sharks came. I saw what they... I
saw. The next day I killed him. He
didn't even fight back. He knew he
had gone too far, even by his
standards. He'd left the knife out
on the bench. And I did to him what
he did to the sailor. He was such
an evil man, but worse still, he
brought the evil out in me."|location|||

So...  the stories... Both the zebra
and the sailor broke their leg. And
the hyena killed the zebra and the
orangutan. So ... the hyena is the
cook. And the sailor is the zebra,
mother is the orangutan... and
you're... the tiger.
ADULT PI
Can I ask you something?
WRITER
Of course.
ADULT PI
I've told you two stories about
what happened out on the ocean.
Neither explains what caused the
sinking of the ship, and no one can
prove which story is true and which
is not. In both stories, the ship
sinks, my family dies, and I
suffer.
WRITER
True.
ADULT PI
So which story do you prefer?
WRITER
The story with the tiger. That's
the better story.

(Heartfelt:)
Thank you. And so it goes with God.

(Pause. He looks up.)
Mamaji was right. It is an amazing
story. Will you really let me write
it?
ADULT PI
Of course. Isn't that why Mamaji
sent you here, after all?"|unknown|||
