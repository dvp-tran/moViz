dusty lifeless airstrip somewhere in Vietnam.  Nothing seems to
live or move in the midday sun.
TITLES RUN
A DOZEN NEW RECRUITS step off the plane, unloading their duffel
bags, looking around like only the new can look around, their
hair regulation-clipped, crisp, new green fatigues fitting them
like cardboard.
CHRIS TAYLOR is just another one of them - as he turns into a
tight closeup, to look at a motorized cart pulling up alongside
... He's about 21.  Newmeat.  His face, unburned yet by the sun,
is tense, bewildered, innocent, eyes searching for the truth.
They fall now on a heap of BODY BAGS in the back of the cart.
Two soldiers begin loading them onto the plane.  Flies - hundreds
of flies - buzz around them, the only cue to their contents."|stage direction

loaded onto the plane.  Moving over now to a motley HALF DOZEN
VETERANS bypassing them on their way to the plane.  They look
happy.  Very happy, chatting it up.
They pass the newboys - and they shake their heads, their eyes
full of an almost mocking pity."|stage direction

walks slower than the rest, a slight limp.  His eyes fall on
Chris.
They're frightening eyes, starved, hollow, sunken deep in his
face, black and dangerous.  The clammy pallor of malaria clings
to him as he looks at Chris through decayed black teeth.  Then
the sun flares out on him and he's past.  And Chris looks back.
Disturbed.  It's as if the man was not real.  For a moment there.
As if he were a ghost.
Chris walking, duffel bag on the shoulder, looks up at the
lollipop sun burning a hole through the sky.  A rushing SOUND
now.  Of frightening intensity, an effect combining the blast of
an airplane with the roar of a lion as we hardcut to:"|stage direction
12||EXT. JUNGLE - SOMEWHERE IN VIETNAM - DAY|location
13||"The sun matches the intensity of the previous shot as we move
down into thick green jungle.  We hear the sound of MEN coming, a
lot of men.  The thwack of a machete.  Brush being bulled.  We
wait.  They are getting close.
The CREDITS continue to run.
SUBTITLE reads: December 1967 - Bravo Company, 25th Infantry
Division - Somewhere near the Cambodian Border.
A sweating white face comes into view. CHRIS - cutting point.
Machete in one hand, whacking out a path for the platoon, M-16 in
the other, he looks like he's on the verge of heat exhaustion.
Breathing too hard, pacing himself all wrong, bumping into
things, tripping, not quite falling, he looks pathetic here in
the naturalness of the jungle.  An urban transplant, slightly
neurotic and getting more so.
His rucksack is coming apart as well, about 70 badly packed
pounds banging noisily.
Behind him BARNES now comes, the Platoon Sergeant.  Then the RTO,
his radio man, humming lightly.  Others are behind, the column
snaking back deep into the brush.
We cut around some FACES of the Platoon - all to be seen later.
Young faces, hard and dirty after weeks in the field, exhausted
yet alert, fatigues filthy, slept-in, torn, personalized, hair
way past regulation length, medals, bandanas.  A jungle army.
Boys.
Chris glancing down at his raw bleeding blisters. Transfers the
machete to his other, slightly less blistered, hand.  The kid
cuts on - struggling but trying, on his last reserves of
strength, smashing almost straight forward through brush, not
even bothering to look ahead.  He smells something, looks around,
slows his pace, eyes working ... around to the base of a tree.
He moves past it.
And as he does so, the camera from his POV comes around on a dead
decomposing 10-day-old GOOK - eyes starting from its sockets,
worms and flies feasting.
Chris draws his breath in, terrified.  Barnes suddenly appears
alongside, his hard humourless eyes looking annoyed from the gook
to Chris."|stage direction

on point, 3 times this week - I don't even know what
I'm doing.  A gook could be standing 3 feet in front
of me and I wouldn't know it, I'm so tired.  We get
up at 5 a.m., hump all day, camp around 4 or 5 p.m.,
dig foxhole, eat, then put out an all-night ambush or
a 3-man listening post in the jungle.  It's scary
cause nobody tells me how to do anything cause I'm
new and nobody cares about the new guys, they don't
even want to know your name.  The unwritten rule is a
new guy's life isn't worth as much cause he hasn't
put his time in yet - and they say if you're gonna
get killed in the Nam it's better to get it in the
first few weeks, the logic being: you don't suffer
that much.  I can believe that ... If you're lucky
you get to stay in the perimeter at night and then
you pull a 3-hour guard shift, so maybe you sleep 3-4
hours a night, but you don't really sleep ... I don't
think I can keep this up for a year, grandma - I

Chris crawls back to his position, curling himself up in his
soaked poncho, teeth chattering from the cold, rain splattering
over him.  A long beat.  He sighs, the sigh kicking off the next

200||EXT. CHRIS' POSITION - NIGHT|location
201||"Chris jerks awake - very suddenly, very frightened.  THE RAIN HAS
STOPPED.  The jungle sounds are loud.  Cicadas, night animals,
water dripping hypnotically from leaf to leaf.  And the whirr of
a million mosquitoes out after the rains, chewing at Chris' face.
He looks around, startled.
Tex is asleep.  Junior is asleep.  What happened?  He looks at
his watch.  The mosquitoes are eating him alive.  He buries his
head in his green towel which he wears around his neck, but he
can't see.  A beat.  He moves again, miserable from the bites.
Another beat.  Then suddenly the sounds of the jungle shift -
some of the animals dropping out.  A different tone.  A piece of
wood is stepped on, a rustle of bush ...
Chris sees something, lifts an edge of the towel to peek out.
A shoadow of a figure is frozen there in front of him about 15
yards.  It looks like a man.  But it doesn't move.  At all.  It
listens.
Chris, his heart in his mouth, tries to peer through it.  It's a
bush.  It has to be.  No human being could stand that still.  His
heartbeats are up.  The moments take forever.  But deep down -
somewhere in his psyche - he knows who it is.
The figure now shifts, ever so slightly - and moves.  It IS a
human being.  Oh my God!
Chris looks around.  Tex seems like a mile away.  Why doesn't
anyone fire!  He casts a desperate look at his rifle, at his
grenades encrusted with mud, but in spite of all his training, he
is frozen with indecision and fear at the sight of his enemy.
The figure seems to whisper something back, then turns and comes
down the trail.  Now a second and third figure appear behind him
- all in helmets and packs.  All coming right past Chris'
position.  Ten yards.  Nine.
Chris is rigid with terror.  Stark eyes.  Pleading with Tex to
wake up, but out of reach.  He is about to have an anxiety
attack, his heartbeats so far up he is sure they will hear him.
The first figure is now directly in front of Chris on the trail,
looking left and right.  A rattle of his equipment, a creak of
leather.  A smell.  The man's face now catches the moonlight and
his eyes come around on Chris.
Oriental eyes.  Looking right at him.  Startled.  Chris staring
back, hypnotized.  It all happens very fast.  The figure murmurs
something in Vietnamese.  A warning.  He swivels.
A flash of muzzle fire.  A raking cough of automatic fire.  A
grenade explosion.
Chris is hurled to the ground, helmet bouncing off, scattered,
confused, jarred.  All hell breaks loose around him with NOISE
and SHOUTS.
Tex, kissing the ground, is yelling at him."|stage direction

anything distinctive and individualistic.  On the tapedeck,
Jefferson Airplane's 'Go Ask Alice'.
To Chris it is a new world.  And RHAH, the resident head, sitting
there in all his finery puffing a huge burning red bowl in a
three foot long Montagnard pipe, seems to be the lord of final
judgement in this smoky underworld.
Across his naked chest, birds and snakes are tatooed.  Around his
neck a black skull and white ivory cross side by side.  On his

activating the grenade-timer, as he humps to his feet and runs
for the gook hole, concentrating, concentrating.  That head is
going to pop up any second with a freshly-loaded weapon and tear
his head off.
Chris won't make it back to the hole.  The throw has to be
perfect.  He won't get another chance.  He heaves the frag, drops
and rolls away.  The throw is perfect, the golden arc of flight
from the outfield nailing the baserunner.  It twists cleanly in
the hole.  The explosion muffled but deadly.

Nearby HUFFMEISTER is hit in the shoulder by a running FIGURE and
collapses into the bottom of the foxhole, crying out in pain.
The running FIGURE runs past right into the full force of BARNES'
swinging rifle.  SMACK!  He crumples.
INTERCUT
Chris bellies into the area, see Barnes, recognizes him, amazed.
An ENEMY fires, taking Barnes high in the left thigh.  A patch of
skin blowing off.  Barnes rigidly goes down on his left knee like
a wounded horse.  Holds there, staring into the Enemy, waiting
for the coup de grace.
A series of SHOUTS and the Enemy staggers dead as:
Chris lays out a curtain of fire.  A GRENADE goes off near him,
blowing off his helmet.  Dazed, Chris rushes forward firing from
the hip - sucked into Barnes' suicidal vacuum.  He cuts down an
Enemy as:
Barnes, given a new lease, limps angrily forward and tackles a
wounded Enemy trying to crawl away, terrified at the sight of
Barnes coming after him.  Barnes lets out a vivid scream.
And beats the soldier mercilessly, half the stock of his M-16
flying apart broken.
Chris swivels alert on his knees.  A pause.  No more enemy.

corpse."|stage direction

moment Chris sees:
A maddened scar of a face, lips specked with foam.  The EYES -
refracted in a red-green flare overhead - the pupils distorted
into angry red points.
For Chris it is no doubt the most frightening single image he has
seen in his life.  It will be in his nightmares forever.  The
essence of evil: wrath, obsession, anger, fear, hatred,
permanence - he is paralyzed.
Barnes smashes him full across the face with the broken stock of
his M-16.  Not even conciously, for at this point, his mind has
gone over the edge and the entire world is his enemy.  American
or Vietnamese, it makes no difference as he strikes Chris harder
and harder.
Chris struggles, moans, his teeth and nose cracked.  Barnes emits
another chilling yell an springs like a humpback up on his good
right leg, the left bent - set to deliver the killing blow, the
mangled rifle pulled to its highest arc."|stage direction

eyes.  A sharp MOVEMENT in the bush.  His eyes fight their way
open.
SOFT EYES are watching him from behind foliage.  A soft, furry
head, alert, rigidly still.
Chris fights his way up to his elbow, in pain, looking at the
eyes.  The head turns and in one fluid move, bolts.  Gone.  Like
the wind.  A deer.  A big brown deer.  Or was it?  Chris will
never be quite sure.  But whatever it was, it was surely a sign
of grace - the grace of Elias.  This he knows as he feels himself
for the first time alive.
And in pain.  His left hand torn and bleeding, shrapnel in his
side, cuts on his face, dried blood caking him.  Looking around
his garden of eden.  A messy jungle floor.  Cordite fumes.
Burned bush and trees.  Torn sandbags.  Dead NVA.  Bird songs
somewhere in the distance.  It is the very crack of dawn, a pink-
red sun casting long oblique light patterns through the trees.  A
holy light.
Chris pushes himself to his feet, feels his weight and the pain.
He walks.  In the near distance, towards the LZ area, there's the
sound of Armored Personnel carriers grinding, men moving, calling
out in Americanese.  But Chris is alone here.

The uniform is shredded, the figure obviously hurt in several
places (thigh, back, neck, hand) but not mortally so, now
struggling to right itself, dragging its face up from a belly-

A huge Nazi flag on an antenna looms up in the bush, followed by
the great belly of a turreted dragon crunching down a tree for
its breakfast.
A big tough GERMAN SHEPARD comes boudning at him sniffs, followed
by a flak-jacketed MONSTER MAN - filthy and greasy, unshaven
face, earring in his left ear, 'DEATH CORPS' scrawled on his
shirtless flak jacket and a drawing of a death's head, he looks
