line of cars bottlenecks as it slithers by.  An arch of
ORANGE AND RED FLARES outlines the area of shattered glass
and twisted metal.
We are at the site of a gruesome car accident.  An ambulance
and four police cars are on the scene.  Two cars are involved
in the crash.  The first, a SILVER CADILLAC with its front
caved in a perfect semi-circle; there is no-one inside the
car.
The second car is a different story entirely.  A DARK GREEN
HONDA PRELUDE crushed against the concrete median that
separates the South-bound lanes from the North-bound lanes.
All the windows have imploded.  The original seventeen foot
length of the car, compressed to ten.  The hood has folded
back into the front seat.  This car is not empty!  Through
the sliver that used to be a window, WE SEE a female hand,
purple, swollen and bloody.
Some drivers have stopped their cars on the shoulder and have
walked over to the flares.  A set of cops wave them back."|stage direction

Maurice rubs his barefeet with both hands -- grimacing from

FLY DOWN from a tree and land on a rock next to him.  Maurice
stares at the beautiful bird curiously.  Its body splashed

Apparently the cop who found the
dog didn't want to get his pants

Gantz looks into Maurice's pleading eyes.  Maurice tries to
say something, but nothing can come out...
Gantz turns away from Maurice and picks up one of the
barricades.  He makes an opening about three feet wide.
Gantz turns back to Maurice, stands at attention, and steps
aside."|stage direction

EXT.  BEACH - DAY"|location
1626||"An empty beach.  ALL SOUND AND CHAOS DISAPPEARS.  THE GENTLE
HISS OF THE OCEAN FILLS THE AIR.
The last fifty yards...
The steps in the sand, heavy, torturous.  Each step, a step
closer to her...
Maurice picks up the pace.  His numb feet making prints in
the sand.  His lungs on fire...
Twenty feet left... Ten... Five...
The COOL WATER engulfs his feet and ankles.  Maurice falls to
his knees like a man falling before God.
Kneeling in the water, Maurice raises his hands to his eyes.
The water spills between his fingers... clear, pure, magical.
Maurice GASPS hard as he falls onto his back.  The water
comes in and washes over him... Gasping harder... He's
staring into the sky... Another wave of ocean gently blankets
him... Gasp... He spots something above him, fluttering...
his vision BLURS... WHITE FLUTTERING... SLOW-MOTION.  THE
IMAGE CLEARS... Maurice smiles as he makes out the image of a
WHITE DOVE FLYING ABOVE HIM...
Maurice takes a short breath, very short.  His body goes
still -- his eyes stay fixes at one point... No more pain, no
more loss, no more words...
The water washes over Maurice A. Parker...
Over his lifeless body...
And over his smile..."|stage direction
