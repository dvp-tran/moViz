E.S.U. Fourth down on the Georgia
Tech 18. 4 ticks left. Kane sets 'em
down."|speech
3||INSTANT CUT TO:|unknown
4||"LINE OF TAPED KNUCKLES - NIGHT
smashing into the mud, as a football OFFENSIVE LINE comes
set, frosted breath steaming across to:
The DEFENSIVE LINE digging in, ready to explode.
CLOSE ON JOE KANE
E.S.U. quarterback, barking signals. The ball is snapped,
and we go to SLOW MOTION as the lines crash together in the
slop.
Joe rolls to the right, looking downfield. A huge DEFENSIVE
END bears down on him. Joe jukes. The end whips on by,
grabbing for jersey, slipping off. But big NUMBER 75 is
closing the gap. On the run, Joe releases a desperation pass
toward the end zone, just as 75 catches him and buries him
face-down in the swamp.
We FOLLOW THE BALL, spiraling through the slanting rain. RAY
GRIFFEN, black running back, glances back for it, two
DEFENSIVE BACKS with him. All three leap in unison, climbing
as high as they can, clutching, clawing for the ball. The
ball floats down, kisses off the tangle of fingers, splashes
to the ground, and rolls to a stop in the mud. Incomplete.
The BANG of the final gun snaps us back to LIVE ACTION.
Joe on his knees in the muck, stares at the goal line, then
drops his head in defeat.
ANGLE ON SAM WINTERS
Betraying little emotion, Coach SAM WINTERS, wiry, intense,
early 50's, takes off his headset, lets it drop, heads across
the field."|stage direction
5|REPORTER #1 (V.O.)|"Coach, this is the second year in a
row you've failed to go to a bowl
game. Do you feel your program's in
decline?"|speech
6||INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT|location
7||"Coach Winters stands outside his office surrounded by
reporters, a bouquet of microphones stuck in his face."|stage direction
8||(keeping his cool)|location
9|WINTERS|"No, we're just a young team on the
verge. We'll be back in a major bowl
next year."|speech
10||"Elsewhere in the locker room, we pick up a weary, mud-
splattered Joe Kane taking off his pads in front of his
locker. ALVIN MACK, black linebacker, comes by. Alvin exudes
danger; big, fast and hostile on the field, slightly surly,
a sense of repressed anger off it."|stage direction
11|ALVIN|Good throw, Joe. It was there.|speech
12|JOE|So was half their team.|speech
13||(trailing off)|location
14|JOE|Shit, another Christmas at home.|speech
15|ALVIN|"Next year, man. Next year we sell
out. Next year we dominate."|speech
16||"ON COACH WINTERS AGAIN
still fielding questions."|stage direction
17|REPORTER #2|"You still need a deep threat or a
breakaway back to go with Joe Kane.
What are you gonna do to address
this need?"|speech
18||(a little edgy)|location
19|COACH WINTERS|"Stop wastin' my time talkin' to you
guys for a start."|speech

23||"CHANCELLOR GRANT WILSON, 60, grey-haired eminence, sits behind
his desk. Seated across from him are Coach Winters and GALEN
HOWARD, 50, the Athletic Director."|stage direction
24|CHANCELLOR WILSON|"I'm concerned about our Program.
It's always been a source of pride
to our students and alumni, but two
straight so-so seasons are having a
damaging effect on our fund-raising,
both public and private."|speech
25||(half-joking)|location
26|WINTERS|"Then stop raising the entrance
requirements on me. We never could
have gotten Alvin Mack in here under
the new guidelines."|speech
27|CHANCELLOR WILSON|"As Chancellor, my first responsibility
is to the academic interests of this
University."|speech
28||"Wilson points to a representation of a football field affixed
to the wall. A football rests on the 40 yard line, which is
marked 160 million. The end zone (60 yards away) is
$400,000,000."|stage direction
29|WILSON|"At a time when we're committed to a
400 million dollar building program,
alumni donations are down 15% the
last two years. Because they've also
voiced their displeasure to their
legislators, we can expect a
corresponding drop in state funds."|speech
30|HOWARD|"The Athletic Fund is suffering too.
Season tickets sales are off,
merchandising's slow..."|speech
31|WINTERS|"You layin' all this at my door?
There's been a recession on."|speech
32|CHANCELLOR WILSON|"Yes, but the heaviest drop has been
from the big donors, the 100,000
dollar club. These people are
recession proof. They sit in my box
every game, and they're much more
generous when we're ranked and going
to bowl games. Two of them, as you
know, are on the Board of Regents,
including the Chairman."|speech
33|WINTERS|"What are you trying to say to me,
Grant? After 12 years, my job's in
jeopardy?"|speech
34|CHANCELLOR WILSON|"I'm not prepared to discuss your job
right now; I just want you to be
aware of the situation. The alumni
and the legislature are unhappy and
they vote with their checkbooks. I
don't pretend to be an expert on
football, Sam, and I'll deny that
this conversation ever took place,
but I do know we need to win next
year."|speech
35||INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - LATE AFTERNOON|location
36||"Coach Winters flanked by two assistant coaches, HUMES and

of Coach Winters hangs from an overhead pipe."|stage direction
37||(ignoring the effigy)|location
38|CLAYTON|"Tickets are in your coat. Itinerary
and player profiles are in your
briefcase. We got a 9:00am tomorrow
in Philly with this kid Darnell
Jefferson."|speech
39||"Coach Winters stops, looks up at the effigy. Humes and Clayton
fear an outburst, a display of rage."|stage direction

up."|stage direction

JEFFERSON and REVEREND WALLACE in a tattered parlor room.
Other boys of various ages and color look in from the
adjoining door. Darnell is black, good-looking, street-hip,
the letters D.J. shaved in block letters into his fade."|stage direction
49|WINTERS|"Darnell, you have the potential to
start for us as a freshman. That 108
yard kickoff return you made against
Taft? One of the greatest runs I've
ever seen a high school player make.
Now, Michigan is set at tailback for
two years. You won't play till you're
a junior. With Joe here gettin' you
the ball, runnin' 28 Thunder right,
you'll be All-American with us as a
Sophomore."|speech
50|REVEREND WALLACE|"Yes, but I'm really more concerned
with Darnell's education. He came
here late. He's got some catching up
to do."|speech
51|WINTERS|"Believe me, education is the first
priority in our program. That's why
all the players are smarter than me.
After all, a football coach is smart
enough to understand the game, but
dumb enough to think it's important."|speech

to."|stage direction

is waiting. He introduces them. She's even more attractive
than Darnell thought she'd be.
She takes Darnell's hand and leads him out onto the field
where he's greeted by the E.S.U. BAND playing the school
fight song. The CHEERLEADERS whip into action, legs kicking,
pom-poms whirling.
The band parts and Darnell walks out into the 90,000 seat
stadium, an awesome sight for any young man. Autumn points

that Bobby Collins should not be

I think Bobby Collins made a big
mistake, but he's already been
suspended for several weeks. He's
served his time. I think he deserves
a second chance."|speech

chance and since he's had 5
incompletes, 4 withdrawals and still

the business at hand, Bobby Collins.
As you know, I played football here.
And I remember how hard it was to
practice and then study when you're
dead tired. So I have some sympathy
for this young man. But I never
cheated, so the real question is his
character. Since you know him better
than anyone else in this room; and
having talked to him and observed
him over the last several weeks, do
you feel he's learned his lesson? In

lifting the back off the ground, whiplashing his neck,
vibrating his helmet. Lattimer's legs churn, driving the
tailback back and into the ground. We see the back's face.

everything at Joe. Joe drops back five steps. Bud Lite picks
up a blitzing linebacker, knocks him over a fallen player.
Joe looks for Darnell in the corner, but another pass rusher
breaks through, forcing Joe out of the pocket. It's wartime
as tackles and blockers collide, hand-fight, go down, scramble
up, collide again, all in pursuit of Joe.
Darnell, realizing Joe's in trouble, breaks off his pattern
and heads to the center of the end zone. Joe dodges one
tackler, shakes free of another's ankle tackle, heads back
for the center of the field. He spots Darnell breaking between
defensive backs. Just as he's buried by two massive linemen,
Joe fires a rocket down the middle toward the sliver of open
space that Darnell is heading for.
The ball barely clears the hands of a lunging linebacker.
Darnell and two defensive backs, one from each side, close
on the ball as it cuts through the air, a perfect spiral.
Darnell dives. The two defensive backs dive. The ball passes
between their outstretched hands by a fraction of an inch,
landing in Darnell's. He clutches it to his chest, rolls
over, holds the ball up for the ref to see. Touchdown! This
time Darnell does go into his touchdown dance.
