breath. He doesn't turn to look behind him. He just runs as
fast as he can.
P.O.V. CREATURE:
Tomething chases Young Edward through the dark forest. Its
P.O.V. is skewed, inhuman. It is gaining on him.
As Young Edward runs, beams of light become visible through
the closely packed trees. Something is up ahead, something
bright. Edward runs towards it.
Young Edward bursts out into a clearing in the woods, running
towards the bright light.
P.O.V. CREATURE:
The light stops whatever is chasing Young Edward at the edge
of the forest. What is making the light isn't visible, only
Young Edward's silhouette running towards the blinding light.

The impact knocks his revolver out of his hands.
Fischer lies dazed in the broken glass. He looks up at his
attacker.
It's Hudgens, standing over him.
Hudgens SLAMS his fist into Fischer's face. Fischer is now
only semi-conscious.
Hudgens pulls out a long, thin spinal-worm. Its many clawed
feet and razor-sharp jaws snap away, its segmented, scaled
body writhing in his grip.
HUDGENS
If you can't beat us, Fischer, join us.
Hudgens grabs Fischer by his hair and pulls his head back,

slipping down his throat.
We continue to follow the spinal-worm as it makes its way
through Fischer's body, weaving through the twists and turns
of his digestive system and internal organs.
The spinal-worm tears through layers of Fischer's insides,
finally making its way to his spine. The spinal-worm then
wraps itself around Fischer's spine, its tiny clawed feet
grabbing hold and attaching themselves along its length.
We move up Fischer's spinal cord to his brain. The spinal-
worm seems to be causing synapses to fire in chaotic bursts.
We travel through Fischer's brain and out of his eyes.

Fischer's expression is now calm. Hudgens regards Fischer,
looking pleased with himself.

The para-meter Fischer gave Carnby starts faintly BEEPING,
but the RUNNING sink tap covers the sound. Something is
coming.
The lights in the Loft flicker once.
Carnby turns off the tap and they listen intently. They can
hear the scanner BEEPING faintly.
The lights in the Loft flicker and go out.
Aline grabs the flashlight and switches it on.
Carnby runs to his revolver and holster. He checks the
chamber in his revolver. The bullets glow.
Carnby looks up, sensing something. He spins around, ready.
A FIGURE stands behind him. It is John.
John looks fierce, his face drawn, gaunt. His eyes are sunken
into dark recesses, with nearly clear irises.
CARNBY
John?
John lunges at Carnby. Carnby is too surprised to defend
himself. John SLAMS Carnby against the wall, knocking his
revolver out of his hands.
John picks Carnby up and hurls him across the Loft. Carnby
CRASHES through furniture as he lands heavily.
Out of the shadows behind Aline, two FIGURES emerge. They are
both missing ORPHANS, one MALE, one FEMALE. They have the
same gaunt faces and clear irises as John.
Carnby picks himself up. He spots the Orphans behind Aline.
CARNBY (CONT'D)
Behind you!
The two Orphans lunge at Aline, but she's able to dodge out
of the way. The Orphans are fast and fierce. Aline leaps
forward, sliding across the floor towards Carnby's revolver.
She grabs it and spins to face the two Orphans. They're gone.

But then the Female Orphan leaps out at her. Aline FIRES,
hitting the Female Orphan in the shoulder.
The Female Orphans jumps away, into the shadows. Aline
scrambles to her feet, the revolver ready. But the Female
Orphans has disappeared.
Aline runs over to Carnby. He grabs a shotgun from the
weapons cabinet and loads it.
ALINE
That looked like John.
CARNBY
It is. The other two are from the
orphanage as well.
Carnby pumps the shotgun. Carnby and Aline creep forward into
the darkness of the Loft. They listen.
Suddenly, John lunges at him, his teeth bared.
Carnby SMASHES John across the head with the shotgun. But
John keeps coming, SLAMMING him against the wall. Carnby
breaks John's hold and swivel-kicks him out of the way. John
skitters off into the shadows.
The Female Orphan leaps out at Aline, trying to tear into her
with her teeth.
Carnby grabs a pipe leaning against the wall and runs for
Aline.
The Male Orphan lunges out at Carnby. He SMASHES the Male
Orphan across the face with the pipe.
Aline struggles with the Female Orphan. Carnby turns to see
John rising up behind her, about to strike.
C
arnby reacts instinctively. He FIRES, shooting John in the
chest with a shotgun BLAST. John flails back, dead.
The Male Orphan jumps out at Carnby. Now working on instinct,
Carnby spins and jams the pipe into his gut, impaling him.
The Male Orphan stumbles to the ground and dies.
Aline gets away from the Female Orphan. As the Female Orphan
lunges at her again, Aline FIRES, shooting her three times in
the chest.

But it's only the third bullet, the one that hits the Female
Orphan dead center in the chest that takes her down. The
Female Orphan falls back, dead.
Aline comes up to Carnby. He stands over John's corpse.
ALINE
You had no choice.
CARNBY
Something's controlling them.
ALINE
How many are there altogether?
CARNBY
Twenty. Including me.
The para-meter starts BEEPING again, louder and more
frenetic. The lights start to flicker, fading up and down.
Carnby unzips the duffle-bag. It's full of 713 equipment
given to him by Fischer. Carnby loads an assault rifle with
713 magazines. He loads a pistol with the glowing bullets.
Carnby throws Aline the pistol. She catches it in mid-air.
She checks it like a pro.
Aline and Carnby stand together, guns drawn, ready.
There's a moment of quiet. They listen.
The lights in the Loft flicker. The scanner BEEPS.
Something SMASHES into the Loft's front door.
Carnby grabs the para-meter. It BEEPS more insistently.
The front door BURSTS open, knocked right off its hinges by
the invisible creature crashing through it.

SHATTERING it. Papers whirl around in its wake.

Aline and Carnby stand their ground, facing the on-coming
creature as it lunges towards them.
Carnby and Aline leap out of the way at the last moment.
Rolling away in opposite directions, they simultaneously OPEN
FIRE. Their glowing bullets hit the creature dead on.
The creature SQUEALS, flashing visible from the multiple
impacts. Their glowing bullets pierce the creature and it
tumbles to the ground, dead.
The creature's invisible corpse lies motionless. Broken
furniture and shattered glass is everywhere.
Carnby's para-meter is quiet, the readings subsiding with the
creature's death. The lights stop flickering.
CARNBY (CONT'D)
We'd better get out of here.
Suddenly, all the lights in the Loft go out in unison. All

The sound of a HELICOPTER can be heard outside the Loft.
P.O.V. CREATURE:
Another invisible creature skirts along the edge of a wall,
avoiding the GUNFIRE. It locates its target, an Agent FIRING
up at the ceiling. It races towards the Agent.
The Agent turns to the attack and tries to fire. But the
creature is too fast. It SLAMS the Agent back against the
wall and impales him with its spiked-tail.
Agents Barr and Cheung spot this and OPEN FIRE on the
creature. It flails about, fading visible from the impacts.
The creature tries to scurry away, but Barr and Cheung are on
it. With precision and speed, they blow the creature away.
But more creatures attack. The fighting is fierce. Glowing
bullets streak through the darkness. The Agents are calm and
determined as they engage the creatures.
Carnby and Aline hold their own, sticking together, SHOOTING
at whatever shadows move around them.
Six AGENTS in full combat gear burst into the Loft. Leading
the unit is Commander Burke. Agent Miles is with him, as is
AGENT TURNER (mid-30s).
Burke, Miles, Turner, and the other Agents immediately join

Creatures SQUEAL as flames swoop up through the Upper Level.
Glowing bullets fill the dark Loft. Creatures SQUEAL and
flail from the hits.
In the darkness of the Loft, Carnby, Aline, and the Agents
finish off the remaining invisible creatures.
The last creature goes down in a hail of glowing bullets. The
Agents strafe the creature's corpse to make sure it's dead.
Agent Barr and Carnby exchange a look between them. Barr
clearly respects Carnby's abilities.
The Loft is still dark. Barr's rifle-mounted scanner no
longer registers any creatures.
AGENT BARR
We're clear, sir.
Burke looks around at the remains of the battle. The Loft is
totally trashed. A small fire burns in the Upper Level.
BURKE
Love what you've done with the place,
Carnby.
Miles runs a hand-held scanning device over John's corpse.
The scanner BEEPS, indicating the presence of a spinal-worm.
AGENT MILES
Sir, this one's infected too!
Agent Turner scans the Female Orphan's corpse. His scanning
device BEEPS. She has a spinal-worm too.
AGENT TURNER
Got another one here!
Burke immediately turns his weapon to Carnby. The red laser-
sight makes a glowing dot on Carnby's chest.
Taking their cue from Burke, the other Agents in his unit all
train their weapons on Carnby. Several glowing red dots
hover on his chest.

it's not controlling me.
BURKE
You'll excuse me if I don't take your
word for it. Now drop your weapon.
Carnby holds his weapon at his side. He doesn't drop it. But
he doesn't move either.
Aline steps in between Carnby and the Agents. The red dots
are now trained on her chest.
AGENT TURNER
Get out of the way!
The Agents try to get a clear shot around Aline.
ALINE
He's not one of them.

An Agent standing at the other end of the Loft hears
something SHUFFLING behind him. He turns to look.
Something grabs the Agent, SLAMS him back against the wall,
and rips out his neck.
It's another ORPHAN, with the same fierce, gaunt look and
clear irises.
Burke turns away from Carnby for a moment, trying to figure
out what's happening.
Carnby suddenly lifts his weapon and points it at Burke.
Burke sees this, but before he can react, Carnby FIRES.
Carnby's bullet WHIZZES past Burke and hits an ORPHAN dead
center in the gut, sending him flailing back, dead. The
Orphan was about to pounce on Burke.
There's a moment as Burke and Carnby look at one another.
Burke realizes Carnby just saved his life.
The ORPHANS attack.
They are the grown-up Children from Carnby's Orphanage. Like
Pinkerton, they are difficult to kill, immune to pain, fast,
and deadly. They all have the same gaunt, wild look, with
sunken eyes and nearly clear irises.
The Orphans leap out at the Agents, quick and fierce. They
bite and claw and use their superhuman strength to throw
around the Agents and tear them apart.
The dark Loft is again lit up with glowing bullets, streaking
through the darkness. The Agents' rifle-mounted lamps shine
around, but the effect is chaotic, disorienting.
(CONTINUED)

As the Orphans attack, they make quick work of many of the
Agents. Glowing bullets fly around everywhere. The SCREAMS of
Agents being torn apart mix with BURSTS of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE.
Carnby and Aline stay together, dodging the attacking
Orphans, and FIRING into the darkness.
An Orphan rises up behind Carnby. He spins and SHOOTS her in
the side. But she just keep coming. Carnby SHOOTS the Orphan
again, this time dead center in the chest. The Orphan
collapses, dead.
Carnby checks the corpse. The bullet came out the other side.
A mixture of red blood and black, sticky ooze drips from a
bullet hole right over the Orphan's spine.
Carnby grabs the comm-link off the body of a dead Agent.
CARNBY (INTO COMM-LINK)
All Agents! You've got to kill the
organism to stop them! Aim for the spine!
cross the Loft, Burke listens to the comm-link.
An Orphan is attacking Agent Miles. Burke takes careful aim
and SHOOTS the Orphan in the back, right on the spine. The
Orphan falls over, dead.
BURKE (INTO COMM-LINK)
Confirmed. Spinal shot's a kill shot.
With this information, the Agents quickly gain the upper-hand
against the Orphans' attack. The Orphans are fast and deadly,
but they have no organization. Now that the Agents have a
handle on this new threat, their precision and speed returns.
Soon, the battle is over. Dozens of bodies of dead Agents and
dead Orphans lie littered around Carnby's destroyed Loft.
Only Carnby, Aline, Burke, Miles, Barr, Cheung, Marko, and
Turner remain alive.
Burke's and Carnby's eyes meet. Burke approaches Carnby.
The other Agents all stand by, waiting for an order from
Burke. Aline watches them, ready to step in.

Burke and Barr continue to explore the room with their rifle-

Commander...
Carnby, Burke, and Aline approach Barr at the hangar doors.
Next to the hangar doors is a control panel. Barr pulls the
front off the control panel, revealing a rusted hand-crank.
Barr pulls on the hand-crank. It won't give. Carnby joins him
and, together, they strain to move the hand-crank. The hand-
crank CLANKS into the open position.
An old mechanism is engaged. The hangar doors slide open,
revealing another doorway behind them. But this one is
clearly not part of the Lab.
It is an ancient, solid gold door, carved with Abkani
symbols. The gold door is built into a wall of rough rock. It
looks like the Lab was built right around the gold door.
In the center of the door is a small cylindrical opening.
A

One symbol is prominent among the others: the DARK SPIRIT.

Carnby stares at the gold door.

Now drop your weapons and back away.
Carnby and Burke drop their guns and step back. Carnby glares
at Hudgens.
CARNBY
It was 713.
HUDGENS
Our early work was crude, I admit. But
eventually we perfected the implant
process. You were our last failure,
Carnby. If you hadn't escaped, 713 never
would've shut down the experiments.
Burke's eyes flash with anger.
BURKE
There's no way this was sanctioned.
HUDGENS
Before your kind took over, 713 had very
different... priorities. Now, you just
blaze in and destroy everything before we
can learn to control it. I've wasted
twenty years working in secret because of
short-sighted men like you.
Hudgens sees the Abkani device Aline is holding.
HUDGENS (CONT'D)
There it is...
Aline's expression is firm, unafraid. She grips the device
tightly. Hudgens is about to pull the trigger.

Hudgens.
HUDGENS
You couldn't have opened it anyway. Not
without this...
Hudgens takes out the hollow cylinder artifact he found on
the Erebus. He hands it to Aline.
Aline inserts the artifact into the hollow circular space at
the bottom of the device, turning it into place. The device
is now a full cylinder with a flat protrusion on the bottom.
With one pistol pointed at Burke and Carnby and the other at
Aline, Hudgens directs her to the gold door.
HUDGENS (CONT'D)
Insert the key.
A
line inserts the device into the opening in the door.
HUDGENS (CONT'D)
Now turn it.
Aline rotates the device, using the flat protrusion on the
bottom. It CLICKS into place.
A small crack splinters away from the opening where the
device sits. The crack splits off into several other cracks.
Hudgens points his pistols at the others, but his attention
is clearly directed at the gold door.
HUDGENS (CONT'D)
When we found the first of them, 713 saw
just another threat to be eliminated. But
I knew it was something more. It was the
first. The first to wake. I've woken
others since then. But the rest are
