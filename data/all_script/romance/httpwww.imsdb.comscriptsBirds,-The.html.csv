1||"FADE IN:
FULL SHOT - GRANT STREET - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY
It is mid-afternoon, and there is a tempo and pace to the
people walking, the doorman HOOTING for taxicabs, the
policemen directing traffic.
PAN SHOT - PEDESTRIANS
waiting at street corner for light to change.
CLOSE SHOT - MAN
at the end of line of pedestrians. He is looking up at the
sky.
TWO SHOT - MAN AND WOMAN NEXT TO HIM
as she follows his gaze upward.
LONG SHOT - THE SKY
with hundreds of gulls in it, wheeling.
MED. SHOT - THE STREET CORNER
as the light changes and people begin to cross. In the crowd
walking the other way, a man turns to look up at the wheeling
gulls in the sky overhead. The CAMERA LOCATES:
MED. SHOT - MELANIE DANIELS
in the crowd of pedestrians, approaching Davidson's Pet Shop.
She is a young woman in her mid-twenties, sleekly groomed,
exquisitely dressed, though hatless. She walks with the quick
sureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride,
a mischievous grin on her face. She continues toward the
front door of a pet shop and enters."|stage direction

3||"Melanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back
toward the street and skywards. The proprietor, a MRS.
MacGRUDER, comes toward her."|stage direction

seen so many gulls?"|speech
5|MRS. MACGRUDER|Hello, Miss Daniels.|speech
6|MELANIE|What do you suppose it is?|speech
7||"MED. SHOT
Mrs. MacGruder takes a look out at the sky. A puppy is
BARKING, o.s."|stage direction
8||(shaking her head)|location
9|MRS. MACGRUDER|"There must be a storm at sea. That
can drive them inland, you know."|speech
10||"They are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird
department now. The BARKING of the dog SEGUES into the clamor
of innumerable birds, TWEETING, TWITTERING, CAWING as Melanie
and Mrs. MacGruder go to the counter at the far end.  There
is a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls
are lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so
that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained
birds to be sure. The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic
birds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages,
larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets
in the bigger cages. As they walk:"|stage direction

Miss Daniels."|speech

now)"|location
17|MRS. MACGRUDER|"I've been calling all morning. Oh,
you have no idea. Miss Daniels,
they're so difficult to get, really
they are. We get them from India,
you know, when they're just little
chicks, and then we have to..."|speech
18|MELANIE|"Well, this one won't be a chick,
will he?"|speech
19|MRS. MACGRUDER|"Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly
not. This will be a full grown myna
bird. Full grown."|speech
20|MELANIE|And he'll talk?|speech
21|MRS. MACGRUDER|"Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no.
You'll have to teach him to talk."|speech

again. They said three o'clock."|speech

Would you mind waiting?"|speech

Could I just call?"|speech

42|MRS. MACGRUDER (O.S.)|"Well, how long do you think...? All
right, would you check it please?
Yes, I'll wait."|speech
43||"Melanie sighs. Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter,
she begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips
with the pencil. There is no menace in the birds surrounding
her. They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the
bars and mesh of their cages. Off screen, the puppy begins
BARKING again as the front door opens. Melanie looks up.
MED. SHOT - MITCH BRENNER
as he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the
steps to the bird department. He is a handsome man, about
twenty-nine or thirty, well-dressed, and carrying a felt
hat.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
seeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of
strawberry finches. She pokes the pencil through the mesh.
The birds are startled into scarlet flight.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
as they pass each other in the aisle. He gives a polite little
nod, and she gives a polite little smile. But as he passes
her, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look -- and
then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner.
MED. SHOT - MELANIE
looking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of
the cage and then comes face to face with Mitch again."|stage direction
44|MITCH|I wonder if you could help me.|speech
45|MELANIE|What?|speech

with a touch of
hauteur)"|location
47|MITCH|"I said I wonder if you could help
me."|speech
48||"CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
a trifle annoyed by his manner at first. She is about to
inform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. But
then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea
comes to her."|stage direction
49||(solicitously)|location
50|MELANIE|"Yes, what was it you were looking
for, sir?"|speech
51||TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH|stage direction

53|MITCH|Lovebirds.|speech
54|MELANIE|Lovebirds, sir?|speech
55|MITCH|"Yes. I understand there are different
varieties, it that true?"|speech
56|MELANIE|Well... yes, sir, there are.|speech
57|MITCH|"These are for my sister... her
birthday you see. As she'll be eleven
and... well, frankly, I wouldn't
want a pair of birds that were too
demonstrative."|speech
58|MELANIE|I understand completely, sir.|speech
59|MITCH|"As the same time, I wouldn't want
birds that were aloof, either."|speech
60||"(leading him around
shop)"|location
61|MELANIE|No, of course not.|speech
62|MITCH|"Do you have a pair that are just
friendly?"|speech
63|MELANIE|I think so, sir.|speech

78||(baffled)|location
79|MELANIE|Doesn't what make me...?|speech
80|MITCH|"All these innocent little creatures
caged up like this?"|speech
81|MELANIE|"Well, we can't just let them fly
around the shop, you know."|speech
82|MITCH|"I suppose not. Is there an
ornithological reason for keeping
them in separate cages?"|speech
83|MELANIE|"Oh, certainly. It's to protect the
species."|speech
84|MITCH|"I imagine that's very important.
Especially during the moulting season."|speech
85|MELANIE|"Yes, that's a particularly dangerous
time."|speech
86|MITCH|Are they moulting now?|speech
87|MELANIE|Some of them are.|speech
88|MITCH|How can you tell?|speech

expression."|speech

99|MITCH|All right, may I see one, please?|speech
100||"CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
as she realizes she is expected to take one of the canaries
out of the cage. She smiles feebly, glances toward the counter
where she expects Mrs. MacGruder to reappear momentarily,
and then takes a deep breath. She opens the door to the canary
cage, and cautiously puts her hand into it."|stage direction
101||(feebly)|location

day."|stage direction
106|MRS. MACGRUDER|"What is it? Oh! Oh my, one of the
birds is loose!"|speech

them suspiciously."|stage direction

you in court."|speech

137|MITCH|"Do you remember one of your practical
jokes that resulted in the smashing
of a plate glass window?"|speech
138|MELANIE|I didn't break that window!|speech
139|MITCH|"No, but your little prank did. The
judge should have put you behind
bars!"|speech

141|MITCH|"I simply believe in the law, Miss
Daniels, and I'm not too keen on
practical jokers."|speech

if not a practical..."|speech
143|MITCH|"Ahhh, but I really do want those
birds."|speech
144|MELANIE|"You knew I didn't work here. You
deliberately..."|speech
145|MITCH|"Right. I recognized you when I came
in. I thought you might like to know
what it felt like to be on the other
end of a gag. What do you think of
that, Miss Daniels?"|speech

elevator doors open. The man smiles pleasantly and allows
her to enter first. She does so with a small nod.  The
elevator doors close.
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE MAN - IN THE ELEVATOR
The birds are CHIRPING wildly in their cage. The man and
Melanie stand silently side by side. The man's eyes wander

The man is dead-panned, unsmiling. The elevator stops. The
doors begin to open.
FULL SHOT - MELANIE

man is walking down the corridor beside her. She stops in
front of the apartment, hesitates, hoping the man will turn
the corner in the corridor. Instead, he stops at the apartment
just opposite. He begins fumbling in his pocket for his key.
He looks at Melanie.
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

FULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR

me."|speech

by the way this entire trip has worked out. Annie brings her
the glass of brandy, and she takes it gratefully."|stage direction

854||(sitting opposite her)|location
855|ANNIE|"It gets a little chilly here at night
sometimes. Especially if you're over

857|ANNIE|Well, how'd your evening go?|speech
858||Melanie shrugs.|stage direction
859|ANNIE|Did you meet Lydia?|speech
860||Melanie nods.|stage direction
861|ANNIE|"Or would you rather I changed the
subject?"|speech
862||(with a tired smile)|location
863|MELANIE|I think so.|speech

865|ANNIE|How do you like our little hamlet?|speech
866|MELANIE|I despise it.|speech
867||(laughing)|location
868|ANNIE|"Well, I don't suppose it offers much
to the casual visitor. Unless you're
thrilled by a collection of shacks
on a hillside. It takes a while to
get used to."|speech
869|MELANIE|Where are you from originally, Annie?|speech
870|ANNIE|San Francisco.|speech
871|MELANIE|How'd you happen to come here?|speech
872|ANNIE|"Oh, someone invited me up for the
weekend a long time ago."|speech
873||There is an awkward pause. Annie shrugs.|stage direction
874|ANNIE|"Look, I see no reason for being coy
about this. It was Mitch Brenner."|speech
875||Melanie nods.|stage direction
876|ANNIE|I guess you knew that, anyway.|speech
877|MELANIE|I suspected as much.|speech
878|ANNIE|"You needn't worry. It's over and
done with. A long time ago."|speech
879|MELANIE|"Annie -- there's nothing between
Mitch and me."|speech
880|ANNIE|Isn't there?|speech
881||(she shrugs)|location
882|ANNIE|"Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's
never anything between Mitch and any
girl."|speech
883|MELANIE|What do you mean?|speech
884|ANNIE|I think I'll have some of that, too.|speech
885||"(she pours brandy,
drinks, sighs)"|location
886|ANNIE|"I was seeing quite a lot of him in
San Francisco, you know."|speech
887||(she smiles weakly)|location
888|ANNIE|"And then, one weekend, he asked me
up to meet Lydia."|speech
889|MELANIE|When was this?|speech
890|ANNIE|"Four years ago. Of course, that was
shortly after his father died.  Things
may be different now."|speech
891|MELANIE|Different?|speech
892|ANNIE|With Lydia.|speech
893||(pause)|location
894|ANNIE|Did she seem a trifle distant?|speech
895||(smiling)|location
896|MELANIE|A trifle.|speech
897|ANNIE|"Then maybe it isn't different at
all. You know, her attitude nearly
drove me crazy. I simply couldn't
understand it."|speech
898|ANNIE|"When I got back to San Francisco I
spent days trying to figure out just
what I'd done to displease her."|speech
899|MELANIE|And what had you done?|speech
900|ANNIE|"Nothing! I simply existed. So what
was the answer? A jealous woman,
right? A clinging possessive mother."|speech
901||(she shakes her head)|location
902|ANNIE|"Wrong. With all due respect to
Oedipus, I don't think that was the
case at all."|speech
903|MELANIE|Then what was it?|speech
904|ANNIE|"Lydia liked me, you see. That was
the strange part of it. In fact, now
that I'm no longer a threat, we're
very good friends."|speech
905|MELANIE|Then why did she object to you?|speech
906|ANNIE|Because she was afraid.|speech
907|MELANIE|Afraid you'd take Mitch?|speech
908|ANNIE|Afraid I'd give Mitch.|speech
909|MELANIE|I don't understand.|speech
910|ANNIE|"Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch
the only thing Lydia can give him --
love."|speech
911|MELANIE|"Annie, that adds up to a jealous,
possessive woman."|speech
912|ANNIE|"No, I don't think so. She's not afraid
of losing her son, you see.  She's
only afraid of being abandoned."|speech
913|MELANIE|"Someone ought to tell her she'd be
gaining a daughter."|speech
914|ANNIE|She already has a daughter.|speech
915|MELANIE|"What about Mitch? Didn't he have
anything to say about this?"|speech
916||(apologetically)|location
917|ANNIE|"I can understand his position. He
went through a lot with Lydia after
his father died. He didn't want to
risk going through it all over again."|speech
918|MELANIE|I see.|speech
919|ANNIE|"So it ended. Not immediately, of
course. I went back to San Francisco,
and I still saw Mitch every now and
then... but we both knew it was
finished."|speech
920|MELANIE|"Then what are you doing here in Bodega
Bay?"|speech
921|ANNIE|"You get straight to the point, don't
you?"|speech
922|MELANIE|I'm sorry. Forgive me.|speech
923|ANNIE|"No, that's all right, I don't mind.
I came up here for two reasons. To
begin with, I was bored with my job
in San Francisco. I was teaching at
a private school there... well, you
know, you probably went to one
yourself."|speech
924|MELANIE|I did.|speech
925|ANNIE|"Then you know. Little girls in brown
beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life.
I'll go into that classroom on Monday
morning, and I'll look out at twenty-
five upturned little faces, and each
of them will be saying, 'Yes, please
give me what you have.'"|speech
926||(pause)|location
927|ANNIE|"And I'll give them what I have. I
haven't got very much, but I'll give
them every ounce of it. To me, that's
very important. It makes me want to
stay alive for a long long time."|speech
928||(she sighs)|location
929|ANNIE|That's the first reason.|speech
930|MELANIE|And the second?|speech
931||(simply)|location
932|ANNIE|I wanted to be near Mitch.|speech
933||(pause)|location
934|ANNIE|"It was over, and I knew it, but I
wanted to be near him, anyway."|speech
935||(she smiles)|location
936|ANNIE|"You see, I still like him a hell of
a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't
want to lose his friendship... ever."|speech

The children, in party clothes, with their parents, are
clustered around a long folding table upon which are
sandwiches, ice cream and soft drinks. The parents are either
helping the children to more or telling them they are having
too much. There is a general SOUND of kid's CHATTER and
LAUGHTER. Coming up the sloping path, away from the party,
are Melanie and Mitch. The CAMERA PANS them UP the slope and
away from the party in background. As they turn the hairpin
bend of the slope, and come up toward the CAMERA, we see the
entrance of the harbor and the Pacific in the background.

his face screwed in anguish, tears rolling down his cheeks
as he grips the wheel and hits the gas pedal.
FULL SHOT - THE OPEN CAR
streaming canvas ribbons behind it. It turns another bend in
the road.
FULL SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - (THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD)
It is arrow-straight, no curves.
FULL SHOT - THE CAR
in a burst of speed as it hits the straightaway. It begins
to outdistance the birds. The gap widens. A flock of birds

them and through them. The gap grows wider and wider. They
are well ahead of the birds now.

up to turn down the sun visor."|stage direction
