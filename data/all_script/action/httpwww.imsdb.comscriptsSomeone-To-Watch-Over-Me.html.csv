family all here to celebrate patrolman MIKE KEEGAN'S
promotion to detective, NYPD.
The party spills through the house -- front room, dining
room, kitchen, with a small fenced backyard visible beyond
that.  A community of cops on their off-hours, their
wives, kids.  A mix of generations, all the way from
MIKE'S kid, TOMMY, and his FRIENDS, playing among the
adults, to an elderly woman observing quietly from her
chair at the side.  The mood's warm, spirited; there's a
lot of friendship here.

his ten-year-old son, TOMMY, proudly displaying his new

her man.  She frees herself from the crush of friends,
hurrying to join him.
ANGLE:  MIKE, ELLIE giving him a full-mouthed smack on the
lips as he hooks her into his arms.
The picture's snapped, to a chorus of hoots and hollers.
