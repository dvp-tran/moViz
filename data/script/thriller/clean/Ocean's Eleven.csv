LATE PRODUCTION DRAFT
Rev. 05/31/01 (Buff)
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01
FADE IN:
1   EMPTY ROOM WITH SINGLE CHAIR                                  1
We hear a DOOR OPEN and CLOSE, followed by APPROACHING
FOOTSTEPS. DANNY OCEAN, dressed in prison fatigues,
ENTERS FRAME and sits.
VOICE (O.S.)
Good morning.
DANNY
Good morning.
VOICE (O.S.)
Please state your name for the
record.
DANNY
Daniel Ocean.
VOICE (O.S.)
Thank you. Mr. Ocean, the purpose
of this meeting is to determine
whether, if released, you are
likely to break the law again.
While this was your first
conviction, you have been
implicated, though never charged,
in over a dozen other confidence
schemes and frauds. What can you
tell us about this?
DANNY
As you say, ma'am, I was never
charged.
2   INT. PAROLE BOARD HEARING ROOM - WIDER VIEW - MORNING         2
Three PAROLE BOARD MEMBERS sit opposite Danny, behind a
table.
BOARD MEMBER #2
Mr. Ocean, what we're trying to
find out is: was there a reason
you chose to commit this crime, or
was there a reason why you simply
got caught this time?
DANNY
My wife left me. I was upset.    I
got into a self-destructive
pattern.

BOARD MEMBER #3
If released, is it likely you
would fall back into a similar
pattern?
DANNY
She already left me once. I don't
think she'll do it again just for
kicks.
Glances dart between the Board Members.
BOARD MEMBER #1
Mr. Ocean, what do you think you
would do if released?
Danny considers.
DANNY
(deadpan)
I don't know. How much do you
guys make a year?
3   INT. MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - CHECK-OUT STATION - DAY         3
GUARD #2
Ocean, Daniel.
Danny steps forth, and GUARD #1 doles out his possessions
and a form certifying their return to Danny.
GUARD #2
Sign.
(adding a piece of
mail to the pile)
This came today for you. Rest'll
be forwarded to your parole
officer.
GUARD #1
(reading its return
address over Danny's
shoulder)
Those your lawyers?
DANNY
My wife's.
He opens the letter, and as his eyes gaze over the papers
within, he smirks just a little.
GUARD #1
What's it say?

2||"4    INT. CHANGING CUBICLE                                         4
Danny pulls on civilian clothes and there's not a bare
thread among them. He tugs his cuffs and smiles: The
old skin feels good. One last item to don: a silver
wedding band. Danny considers it. Will he put it on?
5    EXT. MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - FRONT GATE - AFTERNOON         5
A sign reads: ""NEW JERSEY STATE MINIMUM-SECURITY
CORRECTIONAL FACILITY."" Someone has graffitied below it:
""If you were in prison, you'd be home now.""
The great metal door opens, and Danny stands within its
frame, ready for release. (If it matters -- and if you
notice -- he's wearing his wedding ring.)
He hovers   there for a moment, on the precipice of
freedom.    The WIND WHISTLES a little on the other side of
the gate,   and the view ahead is not pleasant (New
Jersey):    Life is hard out there.
But Danny musters his courage, then takes his first step
into free America...
A6   EXT. ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK - DUSK                           A6
Any empty wintery boardwalk.
6    INT. CASINO (ATLANTIC CITY) - NIGHT                           6
... And his wingtip lands squarely on plush red
carpeting.
As we PULL UP TO Danny's face and SPIN AROUND him, we
hear, then see the BUZZ of a CASINO floor: the HUM of
CONVERSATION, the DING-DING-DING and THUNK-THUNK-THUNK
from the SLOTS, the brisk WHIR of SHUFFLED CARDS.
And to Danny, it's a hearth and fire and a comfy chair
and a snifter of brandy. He's home.
ON DANNY'S WALLET
As he pulls out several crisp one hundreds, sets them on
green felt, then sees them replaced by a neat pile of
chips.
4.
7   AT BLACKJACK TABLE                                            7
Danny cranes his neck about the casino, looking for
someone -- a friend, somebody who should be here -- but
without success. He turns his attention back to his
cards, and the cards of the dealer.
Nine-ten. Stay. Dealer -- seventeen. Danny wins.
King-four. Dealer shows a six. Stick. Dealer busts.
Queen-ace. Twenty-one. Danny wins again.
A second dealer relieves the first, and Danny recognizes
him with a smile -- this wasn't the friend he was
scouting for, but two hours out of the joint any familiar
face is welcome.
DANNY
Hello, Frank.
The new dealer (FRANK CATTON) glances up at Danny, and
his eyes go wide, like a priest who's discovered he's
dealing communion wafers to the pontiff himself. He
quickly hides his astonishment.
FRANK
I beg your pardon, sir. You must
have me confused with someone
else. My name is Ramon. See?
He taps the name embroidered on his vest, although he is
the most African-looking Ramon you've ever seen. A pit
boss circles close by and glares at them both.
DANNY
My mistake...
(collecting his chips,
doubled)
Table's cold anyway.
FRANK
You might try the lounge at the
Grand, sir. It gets busy around
one.
DANNY
(as he goes)
Thanks.
8   INT. LOUNGE AT GRAND                                          8
Danny checks his watch -- 12:58 -- then the lounge around
him: prison had more nightlife. He nurses a bourbon,
folds back the New York Times and scans.

His eyes move down the page and stop at a header --
""Vegas' Paradiso to be Razed; Former Owner Denounces
Plans"" -- accompanied by two photographs...
The first: Tan, well-coiffed developer and new owner of
the Paradiso, Terry Benedict, with a beautiful (if barely
visible) woman on his arm. The second: scowling former
owner, Reuben Tishkoff.
FRANK (O.S.)
Catching up on current events?
Danny lowers the paper; Frank is sitting across from him,
changed out of his dealer's threads.
DANNY
Ramon?
FRANK
Glad to meet you. Frank Catton
wouldn't get by the gaming board.
(beat)
You just out?
DANNY
This afternoon.
FRANK
(re: Danny's drink
and whereabouts)
And already turning over a new
leaf.
Frank signals a passing waitress; she ignores him.
DANNY
(directly, this is
why he's here)
You seen him?
FRANK
Last I heard he was in L.A.
Teaching movie stars how to
play cards.
(beat)
Why? You don't have something
planned already?
DANNY
You kidding? I just became a
citizen again.
Frank stares at Danny a moment, finally catches his eye,
and Danny can't help but grin: of course he has.

CLOSE ON a souped-up tractor-wheeled monster truck, its
ENGINE ROARING before a starting line, itching to cross
it. Now take a step back...
That souped-up monster truck stands a foot-and-a-half off
the ground and sprouts an antenna from its back bumper.
It's a remote-controlled toy.
The ROARING ENGINE comes from the vehicle next to it: an
actual monster truck. Both vehicles peer down the track
at a finish line a hundred yards away. This is a race.
The drivers stare each other down: TURK (behind the
wheel of the truck) and VIRGIL (track-side, remote
control in hand) MALLOY. They're nice boys. Really.
Peckerwoods, sure, but nice.

COATS RUBBER on the track, Virgil's toy zips to a lead.
It's looking to be an embarrassment for Turk until he
jerks his wheel a little and -- ka-thunk -- flattens his
brother's vehicle.

man in a frayed jacket: LINUS.
Two overgroomed STOCKBROKERS stand with their backs to
the young man, yammering about high interest yields, and
consequently they don't notice (and neither do we, not at
first) that Linus is slowly picking one of their pockets.
The thievery is glacier-paced: Linus, his face always
forward and inscrutable, gingerly raises one tail of his
target's Brooks Brothers jacket and then, with
incomparable dexterity, unbuttons his wallet pocket with
a flick of his thumb and forefinger.
From halfway down the train car, nothing appears amiss,
and no passenger looks the wiser. Or so it seems...
A copy of the Chicago Sun-Times, opened and upheld,
lowers just enough to allow its reader a peek at Linus.
It is Danny, smirk on his lips: He (and he alone) is
aware of the ongoing heist.
Back to Linus, his spoils (a Gucci wallet) now in sight,
but he waits for just the right moment, and then, when
the train hits another curve...

Scientists demonstrate the pinch, a lithium wire in a
glass vacuum tube the size of a small refrigerator.
BASHER (V.O.)
A pinch is the equivalent of a
cardiac arrest for any broad-band
electrical circuitry. Or better
yet: A pinch is a bomb... but
without the bomb. Every time a
nuclear weapon detonates, it
unleashes an electromagnetic pulse
which shuts down any power source
within its vicinity. That tends
not to matter in most cases
because the nuclear weapon
destroys everything you might need
power for anyway. Now a pinch
creates a similar electromagnetic
pulse, but without the headache of
mass destruction and death. So
instead of Hiroshima, you get the
Seventeenth Century.

Yen stretches his hand out to grab it, but it's slid
beyond his reach, to the edge of falling.

Saul's briefcase inches closer to falling off the cash cart,
which of course would trigger the floor sensor and terminate
this heist here and now. Yen's hand stretches farther out to
grab it, pushing up just a little more on the false lid
until...
... the briefcase tumbles toward the floor...
... but not before Yen snags the handcuff chain attached to
it and swings it round. He's got it. That threat over, he
throws open the cash cart lid and takes the biggest breath
of his life.

anteroom (the one he stole from Benedict). He steps back
as it slides open, revealing --
-- the vault door:     it is sleek and immense and
impregnable.

Yen now sits perched atop the cash cart, Saul's briefcase
opened beside him (he has removed half of Lyman's
""emeralds""). He hears the muffled Danny's slaps and he
knows: it's time for his leap. It's the same distance
as the leap he made in the practice session, but this
time he's only got one good hand.
