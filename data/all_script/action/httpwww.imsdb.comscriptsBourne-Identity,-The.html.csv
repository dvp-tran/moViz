is not finished.

would have to be very nervous about being recognized. If he
was Kane and Kane stayed here, he's not the guy to do whatever
""social engineering"" needs doing.
Long version? Bourne sets the table and Marie gets the goods.
Somehow there's a threat from Treadstone or Wombosi.
Fast version? It's all results -- we see them execute a plan
rather than work it up. MARIE is already in the hotel. In a
hotel uniform? Posing as a guest? In any case, she looks
very much different than we've ever seen her before.
