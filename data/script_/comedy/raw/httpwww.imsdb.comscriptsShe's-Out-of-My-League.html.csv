pretty. He rates her a seven, the next is also pretty and
gets another seven, the next girl is very unattractive. Her
score is three. Kirk feels bad for her and rates her a ten.
He checks his phone. He moves on to ""BackDoorAsians.com.""
4) Kirk watches a Connery James Bond movie on TV. The lower
third reads, ""AMC's 24 Hours of Bond."" No Missed Calls. The
sun is setting and Bond is now Roger Moore - No Missed Calls.
Kirk digs a box of Ding Dongs out of the trash and eats them
as he watches. It's dark outside and Kirk is in bed watching
Timothy Dalton - No Missed Calls. The morning light is
creeping in as Pierce Brosnan does the driving and Kirk is
still awake looking devastated - No Missed Calls.
5) Kirk is at a convenience store buying milk. He is a mess -
tired, unshaven, wearing a frumpy sweatsuit. He passes the
magazine rack and something catches his eye. It's a gorgeous
picture of Molly on the cover of Phoenix Entrepreneur

formation. A wider shot reveals that their jet trails spell
out ""MOLLY"" inside a heart. Reverse to pan across Molly
(worried about Kirk's reaction), Kirk (trying not betray his
insecurity) and Stainer (trying to hold back his laughter.)
2) Kirk and Molly in a crowded movie theatre. She squeezes
his hand and he smiles back at her. Molly turns back to the
screen and Kirk's smile quickly degrades into a dirty look.
The shot widens to reveal who Kirk is glaring at - another
man (also with a date) sits on Molly's opposite side and
stares down at her cleavage. The man looks up to meet Kirk's
gaze and smiles back. He offers Kirk a fist-tap behind
Molly's head. Annoyed, Kirk doesn't tap back. Molly is
oblivious to this exchange.
3) As Molly walks down a city sidewalk at night, Kirk has
stopped to tie his shoe. When he trots after her to catch up,
he is tackled by two cops."|stage direction

detector wand. Molly sits with the kids who look bored out
of their minds. Suddenly, the kids light up and Kirk feels
he's making an impression until he realizes that Talon has
come up behind him. Talon is dressed in his flight suit and
carrying an arm-load of toy jets. The kids excitedly jump up

Kirk and Molly enter her modern, luxurious condo.   Kirk takes
her coat. They kiss.
Kirk opens a bottle of wine.   He pours one glass to share.
They sit on the couch talking. Kirk is on!    He is confident
and silly and Molly is eating it up.
They are making out passionately on the couch.
Molly stands and extends her hand to Kirk. Kirk stands and
his boner is impossible to miss. This time he looks down at
it as if to say, ""How 'bout them apples!?"" Molly laughs and
leads him into the bedroom.
Kirk sits on the bed and Molly goes into the bathroom. He
lights a candle. He is now in a normal state of nervousness
but nothing like he had been before. He pulls out a stick of
gum. He chews it quickly and spits it out.
Kirk lies down and then sits up and then repeats this.   He
decides to sit.
Molly opens the door. She is wearing sexy ligerie and
slippers. She looks perfect. She crosses to the bed and
sits down next to Kirk. They kiss but Molly stops.
