Over the BLACK we hear the SOUNDS of two people making love.  A
MAN'S VOICE MOANS passionately.
FADE IN:"|unknown
1||INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT|location
2||"ANDREW MARSH lies on his back in bed.  He is a frail-looking
man in his early sixties, with thinning gray hair.  On top of
him is a much younger WOMAN.  Although her back is to us, we
catch flashes of her face for a moment as she turns from side
to side.  We see enough to know that this is a beautiful woman.
She moves wildly, grinding her hips into him, her head arched
back, her hands rubbing lightly over her breasts.  She reaches
down, grabbing his hips and jerks them upwards, forcing him
deeper inside her.  They move together -- faster -- and faster.
The CAMERA slowly begins to PULL BACK.  As it does we see what
we are watching is on a TELEVISION.
Further back still.  We see TWO UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS
standing before the television watching the act.
The CAMERA begins to pan around the room.  Rain streaks down
the windows of the room -- LIGHTNING flashes outside.  A VIDEO
CAMERA is set up on a tripod.  More PLAIN CLOTHES POLICE,
looking, dusting, talking.
We continue to PAN.  We can now see it is the same room on the
tape.  ON the bed lies the naked body of ANDREW MARSH, a sheet
covering his lower torso.  His face is ashen, mouth open, his
dull eyes looking out in a fixed stare.  The last instant of
his life is etched upon a face frozen in pain."|unknown
3||EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT|location
4||"LIGHTNING fills the night sky.  THUNDER BOOMS overhead.  The
wind whips the RAIN furiously against anything in its path.
The CAMERA moves slowly along rows of beautiful HOMES.  At the
end is a cul-de-sac.  Several POLICE CARS are in the driveway,
their RED LIGHTS FLASHING.
A four-door SEDAN pulls into the driveway.  JOHN CARDENAS steps
out into the rain.  He is a handsome Latin in his thirties,
with hard, chiseled features and black, slicked-backed hair.
He does not run through the rain -- he walks.
DETECTIVE REESE, a man who looks more like an accountant than a
homicide detective runs out to meet him.

6||Is it Marsh?|unknown
7||REESE|location
8||"Yeah.
Just a hint of sadness shows on Cardenas' face.  It lasts an
instant, then it's gone."|unknown
9||REESE|location
10||"Sir, do you mind if we get out of the
rain?
Cardenas doesn't move.  He ignores the question."|unknown

16||She was here?|unknown

papers."|unknown
19||CARDENAS|location
20||"Show me.
Reese starts for the house.  Cardenas looks up into the night
sky.  A FLASH of LIGHTNING fills the SCREEN."|unknown
21||INT.  HOUSE, BEDROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA - NIGHT|location
22||"Pull back to reveal a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER snapping pictures of
Marsh in bed.
Cardenas enters followed by Reese.  He moves through the
FORENSIC and MEDICAL TEAMS.  Anything Cardenas feels about the
gruesome sight before him is hidden behind a mask of
indifference.
Standing by the bed is ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY, ROGER
TROXELL, a short, baby-faced man.  Cardenas looks down at the
body, then over at the MEDICAL EXAMINER, DR. HENRY McCURDY, a
portly man with windblown cheeks and bloodshot eyes."|unknown

30||"Not sure.  I'll have everything you
need tomorrow."|unknown
31||REESE|location
32||"Take a look at this.
Reese points to the nightstand drawer and Troxell opens it.  On
top of the nightstand is a box of tissues and a bottle of nasal
spray.  Inside are ROPES, HANDCUFFS and an assortment of SEXUAL
AIDES."|unknown
33||TROXELL|location
34||"This guy was into some kinky shit.
Cardenas looks at the various sexual devices, then walks out of
the room."|unknown
35||INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT|location
36||"JOANNE BRASLOW sits on chair.  Her eyes are tired -- red from
crying.  She is mid thirties -- attractive, but her looks come
more from effort than nature -- expensive hair cut -- the right
cosmetics.  She has a corporate look to her.
Cardenas steps into the hall and walks over to her."|unknown
37||CARDENAS|location
38||"Miss Braslow -- I'm District Attorney
John Cardenas.  You arrived at what
time tonight?"|unknown
39||JOANNE|location
40||A little after eleven.|unknown
41||CARDENAS|location
42||Why did you come by?|unknown
43||JOANNE|location
44||I had some papers to pick up.|unknown
45|CARDENAS|Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?|speech
46|JOANNE|I assume his girlfriend.|speech

48|CARDENAS|Her name?|speech
49|JOANNE|Rebecca Lawson.|speech
50|CARDENAS|"You wouldn't know her address, would
you?"|speech
51|JOANNE|No -- but I can get it for you.|speech
52|CARDENAS|Thank you.|speech
53||INT.  HALLWAY, CITY HALL BUILDING - DAY|location
54||Cardenas walks down the corridor with McCurdy.|stage direction
55|MCCURDY|"Marsh wasn't alone.  We found traces
of sperm on the sheets.  The
toxicology report says there were
high levels of cocaine in his blood."|speech
56|CARDENAS|What'd he die of?|speech
57|MCCURDY|"The official cause of death was a
cardiac arrest."|speech
58|CARDENAS|The official cause?|speech
59|MCCURDY|That's what my report will read.|speech
60|CARDENAS|But there's more?|speech
61||They reach a door and stop.|stage direction
62|MCCURDY|"It's speculative at this point.
Marsh had advanced Arterial disease.
His heart attack was induced by
excessive aerobic activity -- in
conjunction with the drug."|speech

follows."|stage direction
64||5|unknown
65||INT.  CARDENAS' OFFICE - DAY|location
66||"Spacious and sparsely furnished.  The walls are empty.  No
commendations, plaques or photographs to add prestige to the
office.  Cardenas steps into the room and looks at McCurdy who
is already seated next to Reese and Troxell."|stage direction
67||(to McCurdy)|location
68|CARDENAS|"What are you saying, Henry?  That his
girlfriend fucked him to death?"|speech
69|MCCURDY|Yes.|speech
70||"A trace of a grin shows on Cardenas' face.  He walks over to
the window and stares outside.  Reese, Troxell and McCurdy wait
as he thinks.  A beat.  Cardenas turns back to the room."|stage direction
71|CARDENAS|What can we prove?|speech
72|MCCURDY|"We know Marsh had a head cold.   We
found cocaine mixed with water in a
nasal spray container on the
nightstand.  The coke would contract
the nasal membrane the same as any
decongestant, but for a much shorter
time.  He'd keep using more and more
-- never knowing what he was taking."|speech
73|CARDENAS|Any prints on the nasal spray?|speech
74|REESE|Marsh's and Rebecca Lawson's.|speech
75|TROXELL|"What if he did know what was in it?
A lot of users put it in nasal spray
bottles so they can use it in public."|speech
76|MCCURDY|"Cocaine is the last thing a man in
his condition would want."|speech
77|CARDENAS|"Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the
scene?"|speech
78||6|unknown
79|REESE|"A man across the street from Marsh
saw her drive up about four thirty
Sunday afternoon.  And her prints are
all over the place."|speech
80||"Cardenas stands and walks to a DART BOARD on the wall.  He
gathers the DARTS, moves back and tosses one."|stage direction
81|TROXELL|"Marsh's Cardiologist told me that
after Marsh was diagnosed with heart
disease he quit smoking, quit
drinking and started exercising every
day.  Does that sound like a guy
who'd start shoveling cocaine up his
nose?"|speech
82|CARDENAS|What did he say about Miss Lawson?|speech
83|TROXELL|"He can remember at least one occasion
-- and the receptionist can recall
two times when she accompanied Marsh
to the office."|speech
84||Cardenas throws another dart at the board.|stage direction
85|CARDENAS|So she knew about his heart?|speech
86|TROXELL|"Had to.  I also interviewed three
women who were in past relationships
with Marsh.  There's no evidence that
he had anything but straight sex
prior to meeting Miss Lawson."|speech
87|CARDENAS|What about the will?|speech
88|TROXELL|"That's the best part.  She gets it
all -- everything."|speech

92||"A WOMAN dressed in BLACK stands in the front of the MOUNERS,
her face hidden behind a hat and veil.  RAYMOND SATTLER, a
tall, distinguished-looking man in his sixties stands beside
her.  He supports his weight with the aid of a CANE.  The
service concludes.  Sattler along with several other PEOPLE
offer her their condolences.  Joanne Braslow is there.  She
does not go over to Rebecca.
CARDENAS AND REESE stand off to the side by a large oak tree.
Cardenas watches and waits.  He steps forward as Sattler leads
the woman by."|stage direction

94||The Woman stops.  Her back is to Cardenas.|stage direction
95|CARDENAS|I'm District Attorney, John Cardenas.|speech
96||"REBECCA LAWSON removes her hat and veil and slowly turns
around.  She is in her late twenties.  A deep pain fills her
face -- controlled, but evident.  Her eyes are tired -- heavy
from crying -- but no tears show now.  This is a woman whose
grief is private and not displayed for others.  Although
emotionally drained she is still stunningly beautiful.  So
beautiful that even Cardenas' usually cool demeanor cannot hide
how impressed he is."|stage direction
97|SATTLER|"I don't think that this is the time,
or the place."|speech
98|CARDENAS|"I just wanted to introduce myself and
inform Miss Lawson that there will be
an inquiry."|speech
99|SATTLER|An inquiry into what?|speech
100|CARDENAS|"For starters I'd like to know why she
left the house and didn't report the
death?"|speech
101|SATTLER|"Because he wasn't dead when she left,
and even if he was, not reporting a
natural death in a timely fashion
isn't a crime."|speech
102|CARDENAS|Did I say it was a natural death?|speech
103||8|unknown

genuinely shocked by his accusation.  Cardenas nods and walks

counter offer on the Bergman
property."|speech

124|DULANEY|Can't it wait?|speech

Cardenas in the spot-light."|speech

did.  What do you think would make a
man in his condition do the things he
did?"|speech

187|REBECCA|Do you think I did it?|speech
188|DULANEY|"I don't know.  That's why I'm asking
you."|speech
189|REBECCA|"You must have some feeling.  Some
immediate impression.  A young,
attractive woman, involved with an
older man who leaves her everything
in his will.  And the things that
went on in that house.  Such wild
sex.  What kind of picture does that
paint?"|speech
190|DULANEY|Not a very good one I'm afraid.|speech

has been torn away from me, Mr.

find the nasal spray."|speech
296|DULANEY|Why would she want that?|speech

knows that even if we didn't find it
we'd have suspicions as to why a man
in Marsh's condition would use
cocaine."|speech

aren't enough for a conviction."|speech

nasal membranes showed no sign of
prior cocaine use.  Without the nasal
spray we would have still treated it
as a poisoning.  We would have looked
for motive and the trail would have
still led back to her."|speech

wondering what he is doing there.  He walks over to the BAR and
pours a SCOTCH.  He looks down the hall.
HIS POV - REBECCA'S BEDROOM
The bedroom door is open.  The room is DARK -- Lit only by the
moon.  Rebecca slowly pulls her sweater off over her head.
MOONLIGHT washes over her body, SILHOUETTING her.  She runs her
hands lightly over her stomach -- working her way up to her
round, full breasts.  She stops for a moment -- and we sense
she knows Dulaney is watching her.
Dulaney stares at her -- mesmerized.  He knows he should turn
away, but he cannot control the urge that moves him to look.
One by one Rebecca unsnaps the buttons of her jeans, revealing
her sheer, white panties.  She bends forward slightly and
slowly peels the jeans down to her ankles -- then steps out of
them.
We can see the desire on Dulaney's face.  He looks away.  The
conflict inside him grows.  He looks back.
Rebecca walks into the hall.  She is barefoot --  wearing a
long, slinky dress -- her eyes catch Dulaney's.  If she wasn't
aware he was watching her before -- she is now.  It doesn't
seem to bother her.  She moves towards him slowly -- her eyes
inviting his.
Dulaney moves towards her.  They meet in the middle of the
room.  She waits -- he moves closer -- so close that he can
smell her.  She cranes her neck back, subtly tempting him to
bring his lips to hers.  The longing overcomes him.  He kisses
her lightly -- the kiss lingers for a moment, then she grabs
him forcefully by the hair, arching his head back.  She bites
his lip."|stage direction

Dulaney follows.  He tries the door -- it's locked.  He starts
to knock -- stops -- turns and walks back into the living room.
He starts to leave -- stops.  He looks at the bedroom door.
His passion builds -- his hunger for her devours him.  He moves
quickly down the hall -- eyes filled with determination.  He
breaks the door open with his shoulder.
Rebecca is standing in the center of the room -- as if waiting
for him.  He moves to her.  She can see the fire in his eyes.
He takes her in his arms -- kisses her neck feverishly --
feeding his craving for her."|stage direction

hair, jerking his head back.  Her eyes command him to follow
her demand.
Something in him snaps -- a new door opens.  He pushes her back
onto the DRESSING CABINET.  He kisses her, running his hand up
her thighs, hiking up her dress.  She wraps her legs around his
waist.  They move along the cabinet -- knocking jars and
bottles to the floor.  He lifts her -- carries her to the bed -
- lays her down and rips her dress from her body.  Their
passion is unleased.  They grope and claw for one another
hungrily.  She pulls his shirt off and bites him on the

more specific?"|speech

trying to get me more and more worked

as far as she could.  She called it
opening new doors."|speech

handcuffed me to the bed."|speech
