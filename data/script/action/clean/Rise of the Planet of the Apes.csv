9|Previous revisions by|"Alpha sits up, sensing something. BIRDS take sudden flight.
He stands on the branch and YELLS OUT A WARNING. FEAR
ignites the community - but too late.
POACHERS BURST INTO THE CLEARING, horses' hooves kicking up
dirt. CHIMPS SCATTER.
Bright Eyes wants to stay by Alpha's side, but he bares his
teeth and sends her off.
Then he drops, landing firmly on the clearing floor. All
around him, POACHERS pursue terrified apes, nets swinging.
MALE CHIMPANZEES jump up and down, SHOUTING AND SCREECHING -
an aggressive show. A futile attempt to protect the tribe.
Alpha zeroes in on a POACHER attempting to scoop up a YOUNG
CHIMP. He streaks across the clearing, KNOCKS THE POACHER
FROM HIS MOUNT.
Alpha POUNDS his CHEST, letting out a BATTLE CRY -- trying to
rally a counter-attack.
But the other chimps pay no heed. There's no organization to
the defense. It's chaos.
SHOTS RING OUT. The Chimps mauling the Poacher drop, one by
one. Others take off.

Alpha spots Bright Eyes across the clearing, dragged off in a
net. He RUSHES to save her, leaps in the air...
A SHOT RINGS OUT.
BRIGHT EYES WATCHES - HORRIFIED - AS ALPHA CRUMPLES IN THE

ON THE BRIDGE
The FOUR PATROL CARS stop, creating a barricade. The
Sharpshooters line up their rifles, ready to shoot.
DODGE SEARCHES A SQUAD CAR, FINDS A RIFLE, AND LOCKS AND
LOADS.
They FIRE at the apes above them, but it's tough going - the
apes are in constant motion, and the fog obscures them.
BULLETS can be heard RICOCHETING off cables.
Another chimp falls to its death.
Then a heavy patch of fog rolls in, engulfing the middle part
of the bridge, surrounding the barricade. Visibility's
practically zero.
NOW THE MEN AT THE BARRICADE CAN HEAR THE APES MOVE PAST THEM
IN THE FOG."|speech|0|M
1061|OFFICER|"They're all around us!
Apes swing above them, scamper by them. Movement - WHOOSH -
WHOOSH...
DODGE - nervous - crouches low. He edges backwards, hopeful
of some visibility.
That's when he SEES CAESAR, CLEAR AND OUT OF THE FOG,
CLIMBING UP THE ASCENDING CABLES OF THE NORTH SIDE.
WITH RELISH, DODGE READIES HIS RIFLE, AIMS AT CAESAR'S BACK.
There's glare from a ray of sunlight that's broken through
the fog.
He SHOOTS, BARELY MISSING. The bullet RICOCHETS off the main
cable.
ROCKET, climbing behind Caesar, looks down - SEES DODGE
AIMING AGAIN. He starts swinging towards Caesar.
Another shot from Dodge. This time the BULLET GRAZES
CAESAR'S SHOULDER, AND CAESAR STUMBLES, STARTS TO FALL.
ROCKET REACHES HIM IN TIME - SNATCHES HIS ARM, HOLDING CAESAR
UP.
Then, using all his strength, ROCKET PULLS CAESAR BACK UP TO
THE MAIN CABLE.
105.
BAM!
Rocket's hit in the back!
He and Caesar make eye contact as ROCKET FALLS OFF THE
BRIDGE, TUMBLING TO HIS DEATH.
Caesar SCREAMS, looks down at Dodge, who aims again.
But Dodge is diverted by a RUMBLING - like an EARTHQUAKE ON
THE BRIDGE.
The GORILLAS ARE IN MOTION. LEAD BY BUCK, THEY CHARGE TOWARD
THE BARRICADE.
Like a freight train of menacing power.
Helicopters FIRE, MEN at the barricade SHOOT as they try to
back up.
A gorilla falls... but they keep on coming.
And now, climbing up from below - behind the barricade --
MAURICE AND THE ORANGUTANS join in.
Their sheer numbers and power are unstoppable.
BELOW THE BRIDGE
Koba hangs back. He's away from the action, but the battle
waged above is audible.
He creeps along toward the North end of the bridge."|speech|OFFICER|M
1062|AERIAL VIEW|"As the fog lifts for a moment, WE SEE APES SWINGING ON
CABLES, APES RAMPAGING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE, AND
APES SCAMPERING BELOW.
Vanquishing the humans.
ON THE BRIDGE
THE GORILLAS RUN UP, OVER THE BARRICADE, CRUSHING GUNS AND
CARS.
BUCK'S EYES ARE ON ONE THING.
DODGE.
Terrified but refusing to run, Dodge fires, reloads, fires
again, his face red with the tension of what's to come.

BUCK ARRIVES AT DODGE, PUTS HIS HUGE HANDS ON DODGE'S BODY,
PICKS HIM UP, AND THROWS HIM OFF THE BRIDGE.
