Morning rush hour. Sun beating down, asphalt shimmering in the
heat. The blown-out downtown L.A. skyline hovers in the
distance.
We DRIFT past more CARS. Hear one snippet of audio after
another...
One driver taps his steering wheel to PROG ROCK. Another
sings to OPERA. A third raps along to a HIP-HOP track. We
move from a RADIO INTERVIEW to a FRENCH BALLAD to TECHNO,
until finally we begin to hear...
...a new, original piece of music... [ANOTHER DAY OF SUN]
We settle on the CAR from which this new tune is playing.
The driver is a YOUNG WOMAN. She hums along to the riff on
her radio -- then starts SINGING.
Then -- she EXITS her car. Then -- she starts MOVING down the
lane.
One by one, more DRIVERS join her -- SINGING and DANCING
along. Without a single cut, we've found ourselves in a FULL-
FLEDGED MUSICAL NUMBER...
Drivers leap on car-tops, dance Jerome Robbins-style, making
use of the road and the hot gleam of the automobiles. Arms
swaying, feet banging, dancers darting, as the MUSIC blasts.
We WEAVE and SWIRL and DART between and around the cars,
taking the magic in...
Finally -- all the drivers swing back into their vehicles --
and the song comes to a dramatic stop.

She hands the coffee to the Customer. We follow the Customer
out through the door -- as a WOMAN walks into the shop. We
don't see the Woman's face, but we see all the eyes in the
shop turn immediately to her. We see one CUSTOMER whisper to
another, discreetly pointing as the WOMAN passes by...
WOMAN
Cappuccino, please.
Mia nods. Gets it made. The Manager takes it from her.
MANAGER
On us.
WOMAN
No, I insist.
She pays. Then smiles at Mia and drops a bill in the tip jar.
Mia watches as the Woman walks off, is joined by a STUDIO
EMPLOYEE on a golf cart outside -- we realize this coffee shop
is on a STUDIO LOT -- and is driven away...
Then -- Mia's phone rings. It reads: ""MOM"". Mia presses
""IGNORE"" and the time pops up on the phone's screen: 4:07.
MIA
Shit.
Removing her apron and hurrying out, turning back as --
MANAGER
Where do you think you're going?
MIA
It's -- five past...
MANAGER
You'd better be here early tomorrow.
MIA
Ok.
-- then realizes she doesn't have her script, runs back to
grab it, hurries on and then -- CRASHES into a table. Coffee
and food spill all over her shirt, and all at once we're --

Mia's in a thick winter coat, covering her stained shirt. On
her cell, loudly laughing while her adrenaline surges --
MIA (CONT'D)
And I swear to God, she was wrecked. It
was pure lunacy. Oh God, I know...
Revision                      4.
Her nerves are practically visible. As she talks, we PULL
BACK -- to see that she's auditioning for a CASTING DIRECTOR.
MIA (CONT'D)
No, no, Turner's fine. So you -- are you
waiting `til Denver to tell her...?
(as her smile contracts)
Oh. I see...
(silence; she clenches her jaw...)
No, you're right. I understand.
(...and a tear falls from her eye)
Ok... I just... Oh...
An ASSISTANT appears through the glass on the door behind
Mia, waving to the Casting Director: Yoohoo. Can I come in?
MIA (CONT'D)
(crying now)
No, I'm happy for you... I -- I just --
CASTING DIRECTOR
One second.
Mia stops. The Casting Director waves the Assistant in. The
Assistant scurries in, shows her boss a post-it. Mia stands
there, trying to hold onto the tears, hold onto the emotion, as
the Casting Director reads the post-it and thinks.
CASTING DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
...I'll call her back. Tell her I'm almost
done in here.
The Assistant nods. Walks out. Mia waits, trying to maintain...
CASTING DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
You know what? I think we're good. Thanks
for coming in.
Mia looks at her. A beat.

Mia exits. Nerves still on edge. Passes one beautiful redhead
after the next -- all getting ready to cry.
Enters the elevator with two other WOMEN -- tall, statuesque.
Also redheads.
7   INT. MIA'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING
Mia enters. Exhausted. Heads to her ROOM.
Revision                          5.
Old movie posters hang on the walls, including a big Ingrid
Bergman one over the bed. There's also a shelf filled with
acting books -- Uta Hagen, Stella Adler. Various other
trinkets: an old globe, an old blue-and-red suitcase. Mia
takes off her shoe. A blister on her sole.
8   WE CUT TO: Mia in the BATHROOM. Just showered, wrapped in a
towel. She hums to herself.
The mirror is fogged up. She turns off the vent. The mist on
the glass thickens. She dabs some of it away. Dims the
lights. Looks...
With the fog in place, her reflection looks like one of those
soft-focus old Hollywood close-ups. She hums as she brushes
her hair...
Then -- the door SWINGS open -- and the spell is broken.
TRACY
Holy Mother of God.
Mia snaps out of it. Turns. Fog is enveloping TRACY, 27.
TRACY (CONT'D)
Ever heard of a vent?
MIA
I wanted to give you an entrance.

eating Cheetos)
Mia! How'd it go?
MIA
Eh...

Same here. Was Jen there? Or Rachel?

I don't know if they were there.

As we reach FULL-SPEED, a PARTY-GOER races to the edge, jumps --

together, atop a hill, the city glittering before them. It's
""no big deal"", nothing they haven't seen or felt before --
because, after all, there's no chance for romance between
them...

otherwise. Mia tires of her heels, finds a bench and fishes

sync -- without their even wanting to...
And -- bit by bit -- before our eyes -- they've almost
slipped into DANCE...
Sebastian rises. Mia rises as well. The two look at each
other. Run back to the bench, hop atop it -- the lights
stretch out like a magic carpet. They share a moment -- share
a look -- jump off -- AND START REALLY DANCING NOW...
Mia does a move, Sebastian responds. Sebastian does a move, Mia
shakes her head: ""Nope"". They make the road their own, growing
more and more energized, as surprised as we are to find --
...that they can really dance together.
Just as this starts to look like a blossoming romance, real
joy peeking through, our two heroes getting closer and closer
and closer, looking at each other almost giddily...

And then they too begin to FLOAT...
...RISING from the floor, nothing stopping them. SOARING
past the views of comets and moons and nebulae. Eyes wide,
their emotions seized, as they HOLD EACH OTHER TIGHT...
And so unspools a gravity-free dance.
Mia and Sebastian SPIN and TWIRL through the planetarium as
though they themselves were in outer space, flying through
the cosmos. The music carries them higher and higher, and
their spirits likewise soar -- JOYOUS, EXUBERANT -- until,
finally...

Mia and Sebastian drift back to the floor like feathers. They
land on a pair of seats.
There, once again seated like audience members at a movie, they
turn and look into each other's eyes. The music picks back up
for the big finish, as the lovers lean in and -- in true movie-
movie old-Hollywood big-musical fashion --
-- LOCK LIPS.
It's their first kiss, and it's a kiss to remember -- full of
all the hope and yearning and terror and wonder of love's first
blush. A swoon-worthy kiss, with the orchestra soaring and the
camera swooping in to catch the embrace in all its glory.

floor beyond the stage is FILLED with people.
Among them, we spot Mia -- beaming with pride. Sebastian sees
her, smiles to her as he plays a piano intro. Mia grins right
back, heart swelling...
A SECOND SPOTLIGHT turns on, illuminating Keith. He SINGS. He
has a beautiful voice. Mia bobs her head. It's just Keith and
Sebastian right now, all acoustic, a simple, catchy tune...
And then -- suddenly -- a DRUM MACHINE SURGES IN -- and --
BOOM! The entire CLUB is lit up as the MUSIC EXPLODES. A full-
fledged dance beat and a thick radio-ready electronic track.
Mia is taken aback. But she keeps bobbing her head -- as the
crowd around her GOES CRAZY...
Keith owns the stage, as Sebastian plays out more -- now
switched to an electronic keyboard, complete with synth
sounds. We recognize fragments of melody from when Keith and
Sebastian first rehearsed -- but the tune has been
transformed beyond recognition. Not a hint of jazz...
Keith breaks into the CHORUS -- and a TRIO OF BACKUP SINGERS
are revealed stage-left. The band surges into the song's
bridge -- and BACKUP DANCERS appear stage-right, scantily-
clad.
And then -- the lights go NUTS. It's a full-out LIGHT SHOW
now, shafts of red, blue, green and orange cutting through
the dark. The crowd starts CHEERING, pumping their fists...
Mia looks at Sebastian. He's not fighting any of this. He
sees her. She smiles. But something is changing in her
expression...
She looks at the lights, the singers, the dancers, Sebastian
and his bandmates in matching magazine-cover-ready outfits.
She looks at the crowd around her -- their hollers growing
more and more frenzied as Sebastian launches into a prolonged
SOLO..."|location|||

FURTHER AWAY. Sebastian, deep in his solo, doesn't notice.
Mia tugs against the tide of the crowd, but to no avail.
She's pushed to the back of the club, away from the lights
and into shadow...
The final chorus begins -- floor-shaking, fist-pounding. We
linger on Mia's face -- watching as the band feverishly tear
into their climactic bars, the dancers on-stage and the crowd
below busting out one last burst of CRAZED CHOREOGRAPHY --

142   EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT"|unknown|||
874||"Mia and David walk down a street. A few open restaurants and
bars, a few other closed storefronts. A lot of old, weathered
buildings: 1930's stucco, Art Deco signs.
Then -- David's ears perk up. He hears something. MUSIC...
He looks around. Doesn't see the source. Heads to the end of
the block, then sees, just up ahead, a few people entering a
building. Seems to be where the music's coming from...
Mia heads over, curious. The music grows louder -- sounds like
a JAZZ COMBO. Mia peeks toward the door...
...and then FREEZES.
The sign on the door reads: ""SEB'S"". It's written the way she
drew it for Sebastian, years ago...

seats around the band are almost all occupied. Young fans,
older couples, passersby trickling in from outside. It's an
excited crowd, far more varied than what we saw at the
Lighthouse -- a real range of ages and styles.
Mia's eyes drift as David heads to the bar. She recognizes the
images on the walls -- all Sebastian's. Recognizes a stool by
the bar -- also Sebastian's, formerly Hoagy Carmichael's..."|stage direction|||

Mia?"|unknown|||

from the keys, waves ""thanks"".

frozen."|stage direction|||

Mia. Takes the sight in. Beat. Then looks at his fellow

melody we -- and Mia -- instantly recognize...
It's Mia and Sebastian's song.
Mia looks at Sebastian. He looks at her, then back at his keys.
This is the most beautiful we've ever heard his playing. The
most tender, and full of emotion, it has ever sounded.
We MOVE CLOSER on Sebastian. We recognize this image. It
recalls the visualization of his dream, back at the RESTAURANT
that night in winter, years ago. Gradually, as Sebastian
plays, his surroundings seem to grow DARKER. Slowly, subtly at
first, with just shifts in lighting, then a shift in
perspective, the interior of the club changes, and soon..."|stage direction|||

148      INT. STUDIO SOUNDSTAGE - DAY / NIGHT
Mia and Sebastian walk together outside -- but now that we're
outside we realize this isn't the real L.A. at all..
This, in fact, is an L.A. that doesn't exist. A painted-
backdrop L.A., just like the one we saw Mia pass by when
parking on the lot...
The old orange groves and the gabled rooftops and the moss-
covered bungalows and the ivy-decked lamps, the jacaranda
trees and the giant hills and Griffith and the Santa Monica
Pier -- all painted, all props, all figments of a studio-
backdrop imagination. We've entered a fully fantastical
realm, the realm of the old Hollywood ballets of the 40's and
50's...
A148     Everyone DANCES -- the pedestrians and the street performers
and the cops and the guards... AMY BRANDT races up to Mia --
seems to beckon her to audition... We see the audition
silhouetted against a wall... We don't hear Mia sing, but the
music takes on the melody of her song, carrying us to...
B148     PARIS... Sebastian travels there with Mia... We chart the
journey through an OLD GLOBE -- the same one we saw Mia use
for her play -- a miniature plane and dissolves, the old-
Hollywood-movie way...
Finally, we find ourselves looking at a PAINTED BACKDROP of
Paris -- the same one Mia used for her play. The Sacré-Coeur
and the Arc de Triomphe and the Eiffel Tower etched in bright
colors, the ornate lampposts and the cobblestones stretching
before us... And then a sign -- ""CAVEAU DE LA HUCHETTE""...
C148     We see a jam session at the Caveau -- a crypt-like jazz club.
Sebastian plays, on cloud nine...
C148pt   We see a MOVIE SHOOT, Mia surrounded by lights and cranes,
decked in movie-movie glow.
We're BACK to the Caveau. The lights go out -- except for the
TRUMPETER, playing out a lovelorn solo, rim-lit. We MOVE in
close on his horn -- DIVE into the bell --
D148     -- and emerge into NIGHTTIME PARIS. All painted. Mia and
Sebastian wander through this wonderland, pedestrians frozen
around them... Finally, they stop and look at one another...
And -- as the city lights behind them start to glitter like
all the stars of the galaxy...
...they DANCE.

A hint of a tear in both...
And, ever so subtly, for just a fleeting second, Mia smiles.
It's the kind of smile you could miss if you blinked -- but
it's enough to signal to Sebastian that she recognized the
melody he played, and that she still remembers it, and still
thinks of it to this day...
