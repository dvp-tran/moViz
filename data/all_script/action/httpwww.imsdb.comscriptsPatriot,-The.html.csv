arch over riverside maples along the shores of the gently
curving, deep-water Santee River.

6||"Upstream, the swamps.  Beautiful.  Hundreds of BIRDS SING.
Shafts of sunlight pierce the canopy, cutting through the
hanging moss and kudzu, falling onto soft, swaying ferns
covering the high ground.
The water is clear, with fields of floating lily pads,
each with a stark white flower rising from it.

7||"THE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON A
TRUE STORY"|unknown
8||EXT.  POND BLUFF - DAY|location
9||"A farm built between the banks of the river and the deep
green of the swamps.  Good, fertile land, hacked out of
the wilderness.
The perfectly tended fields are ripe with barley, hops,
alfalfa and tobacco.  Two sturdy brothers, NATHAN, 13 and
SAMUEL, 12, work one of the fields, rhythmically swinging
scythes through the barley.
The house, built of native brick, is well-constructed and
well-maintained.  There's a barn, a workshop and a forge.
It is a home of substance rather than wealth.  On the
front porch, MARGARET, 11, pumps a butter churn while her
brother, WILLIAM, 6, watches.
GABRIEL, 18, strong and handsome, walks out of the woods
with a musket in his hand and a dozen game-birds over his
shoulder.  At his side walks THOMAS, 14, also carrying a
musket."|stage direction
10||INT.  WORKSHOP - DAY|location
11||"A perfect colonial workshop, fastidiously arranged with
every conceivable tool of the period.  A foot-powered
lathe.  A drop-forge.  A lifting saw.  Racks of tools,
planes, hammers, augers, drills, blocks, all hanging in
their places.  All very well-worn.
FRANCIS MARION methodically works his lathe, turning a
piece of hardwood, shaving off tiny curls of wood with a
razor-sharp chisel.  He's in his late-forties, strong and
weathered.  His hands, though big and callused, handle the
chisel with a surgeon's precision.  Self-educated and
self-sufficient, he has built himself, as he built his
farm, brick by brick, from the coarse clay of the earth.
A finely-made rocking chair, missing only the dowel on
which Marion is working, sits on the work table.  The
chair is a work of art, thin and light, a spider-web of
perfectly turned wood, no nails, no glue.
Sitting on the woodpile, SUSAN, 4, a silent, stone-face
wisp of a child, watches her father.
Marion takes the piece of wood out of the lathe, carefully
fits it into the chair, inserts a peg and taps it into
place.  Then he steps back and appraises his handiwork.
He picks up the chair and hooks the top rail to a scale,
countering with a three-pound weight.  The chair floats.
Marion blows softly on the weight which sinks.  Susan
nods, so far, so good.  Marion puts the chair on the floor
and walks slowly around it, checking every angle.
Then, the acid test.  He takes a deep breath and lowers
himself onto the seat, gingerly adding an ounce at a time.
Not a creak.  He smiles and sits back with a sigh.
CRACK!  THE CHAIR SPLINTERS under Marion's weight, DUMPING
HIM on his ass on a pile of broken wood."|stage direction
12|MARION|Damnation!|speech
13||"He picks up some of the wood, about to fling it across the
room but stops as Susan shoots him a disapproving look.
He calms himself."|stage direction
14|MARION|Sorry.|speech
15||"Susan gets down from the woodpile and puts the remains of
the chair in the fireplace.  As she climbs back up to her
perch, Marion steps over to his wood rack, extracts a
fresh dowel, fits it into the lathe and starts all over
again.

day, don't they?"|speech

contrite sons who jostle one another, trying to pass off
the blame.  Gabriel and Thomas walk out of the barn."|stage direction

Marion approaches.  He gives himself a moment to look at
the grave, then he starts picking apples, speaking to the
gravestone in a quiet voice that is more matter-of-fact
than sorrowful."|stage direction

no trace of the boys you knew..."|speech

Marion pauses as if listening to a spoken reply."|stage direction

Tread On Me.""  Scores of on-lookers, including respectable
people, as well as street urchins, whores and drunkards,

A moment later Charlotte steps out onto the balcony and
sees:
IN THE SQUARE, a pair of drunk Sons of Liberty, pull down
one of the smoldering effigies, cut off its head, then
start hacking at it's groin with a sword.
Appalled, Charlotte shoots a glare at Marion and snaps at
the children."|stage direction
122|CHARLOTTE|"Children, inside!  All of you!
Right now."|speech
123||"The children start to protest, but a glance at Charlotte's
resolute expression makes them think better of it.  They
file into the house.  Charlotte shoots a glare at Marion
and shoos the children inside.  Gabriel steps out and
joins them."|stage direction

Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from

129|GABRIEL|"He vowed that if the Assembly votes
a single shilling to Lee, he'll
dissolve the body."|speech

thought."|speech

In the square in front of the Assembly Hall a squadron of
blue-uniformed AMERICAN CONTINENTAL SOLDIERS drills.  A
recruiting table is being set up by a Continental Captain

address by Colonel Harry Lee of the
Continental Army."|speech

the assembly.  He's COLONEL HARRY LEE, about Marion's age
and cut from the same cloth -- strong, weathered, with a
powerful bearing.  The room quiets down.
Lee sees Marion and offers a familiar nod, which Marion
returns, stone-faced.  Then Lee speaks, simply and
clearly."|stage direction
148|LEE|"You all know why I am here.  I am
not an orator and I will not try to
convince you of the worthiness of
our cause.  I am a soldier and we
are at war and with the declaration
of independence we all expect from
Philadelphia, it will soon be a
formal state of war.  In preparation
for that, eight of the thirteen
colonies have levied money in
support of a Continental Army.  I
ask South Carolina to be the ninth."|speech
149|SIMMS|"Colonel Lee, Massachusetts may be at
war, along with New Hampshire and
Rhode Island and Virginia, but South
Carolina is not at war."|speech
150|LEE|"Massachusetts and New Hampshire are
not as far from South Carolina as
you might think and the war they're
fighting is not for independence of
one or two colonies.  It's for the
independence of a nation."|speech
151|WITHINGTON|And what nation is that?|speech
152||Robinson, one of the Patriots, stands up.|stage direction
153|ROBINSON|"An American nation.  Colonel Lee,
with your permission?"|speech
154|LEE|Please.|speech
155|ROBINSON|"Those of us who call ourselves
Patriots are not seeking to give
birth to an American nation, but to
protect one that already exists.  It
was born a hundred-and-seventy years
ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has
grown stronger and more mature with
every generation reared and with
every crop sown and harvested.  We
are a nation and our rights as
citizens of that nation are
threatened by a tyrant three
thousand miles away."|speech
156|LEE|"Thank you.  Were I an orator, those
are the exact words I would have
spoken."|speech
157||Laughter.  Marion rises.|stage direction
158|MARION|"Mister Robinson, tell me, why should
I trade one tyrant, three thousand
miles away, for three thousand
tyrants, one mile away?"|speech
159||"Laughter from the Loyalists.  Surprise from Lee and the
Patriots.  In the gallery, Gabriel winces."|stage direction
160|ROBINSON|Sir?|speech

man's rights just as easily as a
King can."|speech

be a Patriot."|speech
163|MARION|It's Mister Marion.|speech
164|LEE|"I understood him to be a Patriot as
well."|speech
165||More laughter.|stage direction
166|MARION|"If you mean by a Patriot, am I angry
at the Townsend Acts and the Stamp
Act?  Then I'm a Patriot.  And what
of the Navigation Act?  Should I be
permitted to sell my tobacco to the
French traders on Martinique?  Yes,
and it's an intrusion into my
affairs that I can't... legally."|speech
167||Laughter.|stage direction
168|MARION|"And what of the greedy, self-serving
bastards who sit as Magistrates on
the Admiralty Court and have fined
nearly every man in this room.
Should they be boxed about the ears
and thrown onto the first ship back
to England?  I'll do it myself."|speech
169||(beat)|location
170|MARION|"And do I believe that the American
colonies should stand as a separate,
independent nation, free from the
reins of King and Parliament?  I do,
and if that makes a Patriot, then
I'm a Patriot."|speech
171||Marion grows more serious.|stage direction
172|MARION|"But if you're asking whether I'm
willing to go to war with England,
the answer is, no.  I've been to war
and I have no desire to do so again."|speech
173||"The room is quiet, the Assemblymen having been thrown off-
balance.  Gabriel is stunned and disappointed by his
father's speech."|stage direction
174|ROBINSON|"This from the same Captain Francis
Marion whose anger was so famous
during the Wilderness Campaign."|speech
175||Marion glares at Robinson, then smiles.|stage direction
176|MARION|"I was intemperate in my youth.  My
departed wife, God bless her soul,
dampened that intemperance with the
mantle of responsibility."|speech

178|ROBINSON|"Temperance can be a convenient
disguise for fear."|speech
179||Marion bristles but before he can answer, Lee steps in.|stage direction
180|LEE|"Mister Robinson, I fought with
Captain Marion in the French and
Indian War, including the Wilderness
Campaign.  We served as scouts under
Washington and I have no doubts
about Captain Marion's courage or
competence on a battlefield.
There's not a man in this room, or
anywhere, for that matter, to whom I
would more willingly trust my life."|speech
181|ROBINSON|I stand corrected.|speech
182|LEE|"Nonetheless, I would like to know,
Mister Marion, how... how... how..."|speech
183||Lee's oratorical skills peter out.|stage direction
184|LEE|"Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name
do you expect to gain independence
without going to war?"|speech
185|MARION|Harry, Harry, Harry...|speech
186||"Marion and Lee drop all formality and become nothing more
than two old friends, pissed off."|stage direction

198|LEE|"I was an American, I just didn't
know it yet..."|speech

the argument avidly, turning their heads in simultaneous
anticipation of each rejoinder."|stage direction
200|MARION|"We don't have to go to war to gain
independence..."|speech
201|LEE|Balderdash!|speech
202|MARION|"There are a thousand avenues, other
than war, at our disposal..."|speech
203|LEE|Name five hundred.|speech
204|MARION|"Royal petition, delegates to court,
judicial redress, economic boycott,
bribery..."|speech
205|LEE|That's five, keep going...|speech
206|MARION|"... time, royal succession,
regicide, bribery..."|speech
207|LEE|You said bribery twice...|speech
208||Marion speaks slowly and firmly.|stage direction
209|MARION|"We do not have to go to war to gain
independence."|speech
210||"Lee says nothing for a moment, then he speaks more
seriously, quietly, grimly."|stage direction
211|LEE|"Francis, I was at Bunker Hill.  It
was as bad as anything you and I saw
on the frontier.  Worse than the
slaughter at the Ashuelot River.
The British advanced three times and
we killed over seven hundred of them
at point blank range.  And still,
they advanced and they took the
ground.  That is the measure of
their resolve.  If your principles
dictate independence, then war is
the only way.  It has come to that."|speech
212||"Marion is silent for a long moment.  He softens, finds
himself unsteady and speaks far more honestly than he ever
wanted to."|stage direction
213|MARION|"I have seven children.  My wife is
dead.  Who's to care for them if I
go to war?"|speech
214||"Lee is stunned by Marion's honesty and his show of
weakness.  At first Lee has no answer, then:"|stage direction
215|LEE|"Wars are not fought only by
childless men.  A man must weigh his
personal responsibilities against
his principles."|speech
216|MARION|"That's what I'm doing.  I will not
fight and because I won't, I will
not cast a vote that will send
others to fight in my stead."|speech
217|LEE|And your principles?|speech
218|MARION|"I'm a parent, I don't have the
luxury of principles."|speech
219||"The other Assemblymen, both Patriots and Loyalists, stare
at him, appalled.  Marion, feeling weak, sits down.  Lee
looks at his friend with more sympathy than
disappointment.  Then Lee turns to Robinson who addresses
the chair."|stage direction
220|ROBINSON|"Mister Speaker, I call for a vote on
a levy to the Continental Army."|speech
221|HAMILL|Second.|speech
222|SPEAKER|So moved.|speech

British GREEN DRAGOONS.  The finest light calvary in the

mounts are powerful, muscled and perfectly cared for.  The
Dragoons themselves are all hardened veterans, marked with
the blood and dirt of a recent battle.  Tired and
vigorous.

carbine, a brace of pistols and a sword.  Some carry
lances as well.  Regimental flags flutter.  They are forty
of the most imposing, frightening horsemen imaginable.

COLONEL BANASTRE TARLETON.  ""The Butcher.""  Aristocratic.
Strong.  Dark.  A powerful horseman on the best mount of

hard, cold authority.  His men struggle to keep up with

killing with stunning brutality...
Marion drops his own expended rifle and CATCHES THE

Two Redcoats left, neither finished loading...

BAYONET WOUND to the neck, HACKS a Redcoat open...
Splattering himself with BLOOD...

SINKS IN THE REDCOAT'S BACK...
