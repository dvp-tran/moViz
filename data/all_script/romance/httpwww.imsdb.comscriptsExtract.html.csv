1||EXT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY|location
2|BEGIN CREDITS:|"An idyllic American factory. There's a huge, long lawn in
front. A Reynolds Extract sign in brick with
flowers/landscaping around it, sits near the entrance. We
see from the number of cars in the parking lot that it's a
company of about 50 - 75 employees."|speech
3||INT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY|location
4|BEGIN CREDITS:|"We are in a manufacturing area of an assembly-line
production. It's a big room full of intricate machines, huge
vats of different colored extract and other food flavoring
products, conveyor belts, bottling machines, etc. It has a
high ceiling with offices on the second floor that have big
windows overlooking this manufacturing area.
We PAN up to the main office.
INSIDE THE OFFICE
JOEL REYNOLDS, head of the company, mid-thirties, is on the
phone with his friend DEAN.
DEAN (v.o.)
You should come by tonight. Half
price well drinks while the game's
going."|speech
5|JOEL|"You always give me free drinks
though.
DEAN (v.o.)
Oh yeah. Well come by anyway."|speech
6|JOEL|"Yeah?... Might as well. No action
going on at my house, that's for
sure.
DEAN (v.o.)
Really? The wife out of town?"|speech
7|JOEL|"No... I just haven't been laid in
a month.
2.
DEAN (v.o.)
You guys having problems or
something?"|speech
8|JOEL|"No. This is pretty much normal
these days...
As CREDITS continue, camera PULLS OUT, back down to the
manufacturing area, past a big vat of orange extract, down
through various stages of assembly line production, then
follows several bottles of orange extract moving past
HECTOR, a Mexican immigrant employee in his thirties. The
camera stops on him. Talking to Hector is STEP, a short,
beady-eyed Charles-Manson-looking guy with a beard and
mustache. Step is in his forties. He makes everything he
says sound as macho and important as possible."|speech
9|STEP|You get this job through Manpower?|speech
10|HECTOR|Yeah.|speech
11|STEP|"I started here with Manpower too.
Started out on the line just like
you."|speech

13|(DEAD-SERIOUS)|"day.
Beat. Hector is not quite sure what he's talking about.
STEP continues telling his tale in such a way that the only
polite reaction would be one of total amazement."|speech
14|STEP (CONT'D)|"I'm the best sorter in here.
That's why they made me full time
with benefits. I'll probably be
floor manager this year.
A FEW FEET AWAY we see RORY, a stocky indie-rock geek, with
too many tatoos, hair shaved on the side with a ponytail,
lots of bad piercings, wearing baggy shorts with lots of
pockets and some kind of gothy T-shirt -- a look that ought
to be out of style by now.
3.
Rory is putting stickers on boxes with a sticker gun. He
flips the sticker gun around unnecessarily between each
application, adding a few unnecessary moves/motions, slapping
each box when he's done, generally making the activity look
like more of a skill than it actually is. He approaches Step
and Hector, pulling out some fliers from his many pockets."|speech
15|RORY|"(hands them each a flier)
My band's playing this Friday, come
check us out.
Hector looks down at the flier. It's xeroxed with fifties
clip-art, cut out letters and the name of the band, ""God's
Cock"". Hector just looks at it confused, not knowing much
English, not sure what he's supposed to be doing with the
flier.
AT THE END OF THE LINE, where boxes are loaded onto pallets,
sits MARY, 58 years old, wearing a 15-year-old pair of acid-
wash jeans, and an oversized tweety-bird T-shirt, fanny pack,
and dayglow yellow triangle-shaped earrings. She's pear-
shaped with short hair. She's bitter and bossy, always
shaking her head at everyone. She sits on a stool with a
clipboard, looks over her glasses at Hector, shaking her
head. She talks to Gabriella, a Hispanic woman in her
forties."|speech
16|MARY|"You see that... That new guy.
He's holding us up. It's not my
job to tell them to hold the line
either."|speech
17|GABRIELLA|"And then Joel's gonna come yell at
us, cuz he's not doing his job."|speech
18|MARY|"(folds her arms, fed up)
I'm just gonna sit here."|speech
19|GABRIELLA|You're not gonna shut it off?|speech
20|MARY|"I'm not gonna hold the line. If
they're not gonna do their job, why
should I do mine.
Mary sits there, arms folded, lips pursed, refusing to pause
the conveyor belt.

22|MARY|Joel is still on the phone with Dean.|speech
23|JOEL|"If I don't get home before about
8:00, she puts on the sweatpants
and once the sweatpants are on,
it's over -- I get nothing.
(notices something down"|speech
24|BELOW)|"Shit. I'm gonna have to call you
back.
Joel hangs up and runs downstairs.
ON THE MANUFACTURING FLOOR:
Boxes start to accumulate and fall off the end of the line.
Step sees this, runs to shut off the line, yelling at Mary."|speech
25|STEP|What are you doing?!|speech
26|MARY|"What are YOU doing?!
(pointing at Hector)
What is he doing?
A YELLING/BICKERING MATCH breaks out between Mary, Step, Rory
and Gabriella. Joel runs over, shuts off the conveyor belt."|speech
27|JOEL (CONT'D)|"All right. Now, what's the
problem?
They all erupt in more BICKERING AND FINGER POINTING."|speech
28|JOEL (CONT'D)|"Okay! Okay, everyone settle down.
Now Mary. Hector here is new okay?
It's gonna take him a couple of
days, maybe his English isn't so
good. You gotta be patient."|speech
29|STEP|That's what I was tryin' to say.|speech
30|JOEL|"And Step, if you wanna be Floor
Manager, this is the kind of thing
you're going to have to deal with.

31|"STEP
(KISS-ASS)"|Exactly.|speech
32|JOEL|"Okay, now Step, Rory, Hector, let's
get this cleaned up, and get
rolling again. We can't afford to
fall behind today.
Joel walks away. People resume their posts. Mary starts
right back up with Gabriella."|speech
33|MARY|"You see that? We always get the
blame."|speech
34||INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER|location
35|MARY|"Joel sits in his swivel chair, looking down at the production
floor, shaking his head. BRIAN, Joel's second in command,
walks in. He's a little older than Joel, neatly trimmed
beard, aviator glasses, and a bit of a gut. He wears a
Reynold's Extract golf shirt and Khaki pants. He walks over
to the window, joins Joel, looking down at the employees."|speech
36|JOEL|"Jesus... They're like a bunch of
goddamned children."|speech
37|BRIAN|"Tell me about it. Sorry I missed
the drama; I was showing boy-genius
down there how to back up a
forklift.
ANGLE ON Rory, driving the forklift, handing out a flier as
he passes someone."|speech
38|BRIAN (CONT'D)|"That's his whole career, driving
that damn forklift. You'd think
he'd wanna learn how."|speech

""axed"" me -- for more personal
days. Just like that. I told her

fill out the time sheets correctly
I'll give her more personal days...
(Off Joel's look)
Don't worry, she will never fill
out her time sheets correctly.

to the street to get his mail."|speech

Please go back inside... Please
just turn around.. .Come on...don't
notice me...

It's too late. Nathan turns, sees Joel's car and waves, then
crosses the street to Joel's driveway and waits to talk to
him."|speech
54|"JOEL
(TO HIMSELF)"|"Shit!
Joel pulls into his driveway as Nathan flags him down. Joel
begrudgingly rolls down the passenger side window so Nathan
can talk to him."|speech
55|NATHAN|"Hi there Joel! Glad I caught ya...
Nathan settles in like he's going to be there a while,
leaning with his arms folded, hanging inside the car,
trapping Joel."|speech
56|NATHAN|"How've ya been? I left you a
message last week. I don't know if
you got it or not."|speech
57|JOEL|"Yeah, actually Nathan, I'm kind of
in a hurry here."|speech

(checks his watch)
I should go right now actually. I
gotta call the office before they

You'll be in town then right?"|speech

(DEFEATED)"|Ah...Yeah.|speech
67|NATHAN|"Great. There's this dinner Leslie
and I are going to. It's an annual

the Rotary Club -- it's for
charity. It's just a whole lot of
fun, and we wanted to invite you
and Suzie to be our guests at our
table. It's--"|speech

there. She get's kind of
uncomfortable."|speech

won't be uncomfortable. I
guarantee it. No, it's not like
that at all. It's not formal or
anything. Trust me. It's just a
real loose bunch.

74|JOEL|I just don't...|speech
75|NATHAN|"I tell you what. Why don't we do
this -- I'll go ahead and get
tickets, since they're gonna sell
out fast. You talk to Suzie. See
what she says. Like I say, she
won't be uncomfortable at all.
Maybe I'll have Leslie give her a
call -- you know how it is when the
wives talk, heh heh--
Joel is about to snap."|speech
76|JOEL|"Um, why don't we talk about this
later.
(looks at his watch)
I gotta make this call before they

right there in his garage."|speech
80|NATHAN|"Sorry, I almost forgot -- the
tickets are forty dollars a plate.
I know that's a little steep, but
the food is fantastic and it's for
a good cause. So that'd be eighty
dollars total. There's no tax or
anything."|speech
81|JOEL|"Ah, look Nathan, I really gotta get
inside and make this call. Let's
talk about this another time.
Joel has his finger on the button to shut the garage door,
waiting for Nathan to get out. Nathan stops, just inside.

82|NATHAN|"Oh, and if you need us to look out
for the house or anything when you
go out of town --
Joel's finger still on the garage door button."|speech

guys going anyway?"|speech
84|"JOEL
(BULLSHITTING)"|"Ah, just sort of a vacation. Look,
I gotta run.
Joel hits the button and the door starts going down."|speech
85|NATHAN|"Alright then. We'll see ya.
Nathan finally steps out of the garage. Joel breaths a huge
sigh of relief. Then,
ANGLE ON THE GARAGE DOOR:
As it gets halfway down, we see Nathan's legs, heading back
towards the door. Nathan leans down into frame as the door
goes down."|speech

shouldn't move man; you've got a
nice house. I mean you've got the

vulnerable and sweet about her as well.
Two SALESMEN, typical music store employees -- long-haired,
goateed, nerdy cocky guitar-hacks are giving her way too much
attention. It's clear that they don't usually have women
this hot in their store. They practically stumble over each
other trying to help her."|speech

1058|CROTCH)|"Oh it's okay. Some days it still
hurts, but they've got me on some
pills. It's not too bad I guess...
99."|speech
1059|JOEL|"Well... that's good.
They both sit down on the edge of the dock."|speech
1060|STEP|"Look, ah... Cindy left me.
Joel's nods, not surprised, but sympathetic."|speech
1061|JOEL|Wow... Bummer...|speech
1062|STEP|"Yeah, it is a bummer... You know, I
thought the worst part was having
my balls knocked off, but you know
what the worse part is? Dealin'
with all this bullshit... I'm sick
of that Adler guy tellin' me what
to do. He's a real dick."|speech
1063|JOEL|Yeah, he sure is.|speech
1064|STEP|"The truth is, I just want to have
my old life back -- I just want to
go back to work. I'm a workin'
man; that's what I do."|speech
1065|JOEL|"Yeah... I'm beginning to think I
might be the same way... I'm a
little worried about what I'd do
with too much time on my hands."|speech
1066|STEP|"I just lay around and watch TV all
day."|speech
1067|JOEL|Yeah,... I think I do a lot worse.|speech
1068|STEP|"The problem is, if I bankrupt the
company, there won't be a job to go
back to."|speech
1069|JOEL|"You don't have to bankrupt the
company.
100."|speech
1070|STEP|"Yeah, but then if I drop the
lawsuit, you'll sell the company,
and the new company might not hire
me."|speech
1071|JOEL|"Well, maybe I don't have to sell
the company... You know I've been
thinking; all these years I've been
building this company, dreaming
about the day I could sell it and
retire, but what would I really do
if I retired? It's like that old
saying -- it's not about the
destination, it's about the
journey?
Step just stares at him blankly, he lost him."|speech
1072|JOEL|"I guess what I'm saying is, too
much free time might not be such a
good thing -- like that old saying,
idle hands are the Devil's
playground?
Step's never heard that one either."|speech
1073|STEP|"I'm sorry, I don't do much book
readin'."|speech
1074|JOEL|"What I'm saying is, I'm thinking
maybe I won't sell the company..."|speech
1075|STEP|Really?|speech
1076|JOEL|"that is, if you dropped the
lawsuit. -- and remember, you'll
still get that insurance money --
probably a couple hundred thousand.
What do you think?"|speech
1077|STEP|"Hmm. That sounds fair... But
under one condition..."|speech
1078|JOEL|"What's that?
101."|speech
1079|STEP|You make me floor manager.|speech
1080|JOEL|"Deal.
They shake hands."|speech
1081||INT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - MANUFACTURING AREA|location
1082|JOEL|"Joel walks in with Step at his side. Addresses the
employees."|speech
1083|JOEL|"Hold the line!
Mary shuts off the conveyer belt."|speech
1084|JOEL|"Okay, listen up everybody.
(Waits for them to settle)
I've decided not to sell the
company...
Gasps and murmurs among the employees."|speech
1085|JOEL|"And I'm making Step the new Floor
Manager.
More gasps and murmurs."|speech
1086|JOEL|"And if anyone doesn't like it, I
hear they're hiring over at
Gemco... But just remember, at
Gemco, the owner doesn't know your
names; you never even meet him,
he's at an office up in Chicago
somewhere and you get an auto-
response if you try to email him to
complain about anything. Here, you
can come up to my office any time
you have a problem. Thanks.
Joel walks off. Brian catches up with him."|speech
1087|BRIAN|"Huh? You're not selling?
102."|speech
1088|JOEL|"It's about the journey Brian. The
journey.
ANGLE on Mary. She and Gabrielle start right back up."|speech
1089|MARY|"You know, if Joel's going to put
him in charge, we should go on
strike. You know, at Gemco, the
union handles the strikes and you
don't even have to--
PULL OUT as Step cuts her off."|speech
1090|STEP|"Quit yapping and get back to work
or you're fired.
Step walks off -- maybe pops a testosterone pill. Mary and
Gabrielle keep muttering and shaking their heads.
LONG PULL OUT as things get back to normal at the factory."|speech
1091||INT. CHAPEL - DAY|location
1092|STEP|"We are CLOSE ON NATHAN, in a coffin, embalmed. We PULL OUT
to see mourners lined up, taking a last look at the body.
Joel is among them. He looks down at Nathan for a moment and
then continues to his seat. A few rows back, we see SUZIE,
sitting by herself, dressed in black."|speech

over to her."|speech
1097|JOEL|Hi... You doing okay?|speech
1098|SUZIE|"Yeah, I'm okay.
103."|speech
1099|JOEL|"I heard you were right there when
it happened. That must've been
rough."|speech
1100|SUZIE|"It was horrible Joel. He came over
to ask for that check, and I
just...
Suzie breaks down, starts CRYING."|speech
1101|SUZIE (CONT'D)|".I just lost it. I started
yelling at him. I said horrible
things. He had an aneurism and I
probably caused it."|speech
1102|(CRYING UNCONTROLLABLY)|"I think the last thing I said to
him was ""shut up."" Those were the
last words he heard.
Joel hugs her, consoling."|speech
1103|JOEL|"It's okay, it's not your fault...
It's not your fault.
Suzie's crying subsides a little."|speech
1104|SUZIE|"It could happen to any of us Joel.
Any of us could have an aneurism.
We could die at any moment."|speech
1105|JOEL|"Yeah, I know... I know... But we
probably won't. It'll be alright.
Suzie starts to regain her composure.
They stand there for a beat."|speech
1106|JOEL|"You wanna go get something to
eat... or something?
Beat. Suzie still sniffling a little."|speech
1107|SUZIE|"Yeah, okay. Sure.
104.
They walk off towards the cemetery gates. After a while,
Joel hands Suzie a Kleenex."|speech
1108|JOEL|Here...|speech
1109|SUZIE|"Thanks.
They walk a little further. Joel looks at the Chapel nearby."|speech
1110|JOEL|"Maybe we should've been married in
a Church like that one. Instead of
the Botanical Gardens."|speech
1111|SUZIE|"I thought you liked the Botanical
Gardens?"|speech
1112|JOEL|"Yeah, but... a church just seems
more -- I don't know -- official."|speech
1113|SUZIE|"You think it would've made a
difference?"|speech
1114|JOEL|"I don't know... So, are we still
married?"|speech
1115|SUZIE|Well, legally yes.|speech
1116|JOEL|I mean otherwise.|speech
1117|SUZIE|"Hmmm... We can talk about it I
suppose."|speech
1118|JOEL|"Alright.
They walk for a beat."|speech
1119|JOEL|"You know, this is really bad,
but... Oh never mind."|speech
1120|SUZIE|"What?
105."|speech
1121|JOEL|"Well, as I was looking down at
Nathan there, I was thinking...
That's the longest I've ever seen
him with his mouth shut.
Suzie LAUGHS in spite of herself."|speech
1122|SUZIE|"Joel!
They walk off into the distance as we
FADE OUT."|speech
