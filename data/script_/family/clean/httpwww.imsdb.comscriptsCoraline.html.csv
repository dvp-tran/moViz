A HAUNTING LULLABY plays against a black, star-pricked
sky when something appears in the distance. A BUTTON-EYED
DOLL floats towards CAMERA, through the open window of a
small sewing room where it lands in a pair of WAITING
HANDS, hands that are made of SEWING NEEDLES.
The doll - which resembles a YOUNG BLACK GIRL in old-
fashioned clothes, hair fixed with ribbons and braids -
is placed on a sewing table. An elaborate sewing kit is
opened, and, in flickering green light, the NEEDLE-HANDS
go to work. The doll's old clothes are cut away; button-
eyes torn off; hair pulled out. The doll's stuffing is
removed and then the empty cloth body is pulled inside
out, turning from NUT BROWN to PALE PINK.
Sawdust is poured in the NEW DOLL's mouth; facial
features added; blue yarn hair punched in; and then a
fresh pair of shiny black button eyes is selected from a
button drawer.
The transformed doll, in a LITTLE YELLOW RAINCOAT, its
new button eyes affixed, is released out the window and
BACK INTO THE NIGHT.
LAST HEAD CREDIT APPEARS, THEN FADES.

crouches to attack her!
And then WYBIE IS BACK, pumped with adrenaline, a BIG
ROCK raised over his head! He HURLS IT DOWN ON THE
LEAPING HAND! And it BREAKS into TWENTY LIFELESS NEEDLES.
Wybie struggles to catch his breath. Coraline - breathing
hard - removes the key and string from around her sore
neck. She pulls up the corners of her blanket - with the
needles on it - around the rock, and ties it all together
with the string. The key is left attached.
The two friends carry the heavy package to the well and
DROP IT DOWN THE HOLE. By the light of a stray moonbeam,
they watch and listen until it makes a muffled splash in
the dark water at the bottom. They slide the well cover
in place.
