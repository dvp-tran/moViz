6||"Snow-covered trees in every direction. The ice in the pond
continues to crack, until finally a hole splinters open. A
young man floats out of the water, bathed in the intense
moonlight. This is JACK FROST - thin, pale, barefoot, his
tousled hair frosted white."|stage direction|||

But then...then I saw the moon. It
was so big and it was so bright,
and it seemed to chase the darkness
away. And when it did...I wasn't
scared anymore."|speech|unknown|?|
8||"Jack floats back down onto the ice as the hole closes up
underneath him."|stage direction|||

Why I was there, and what I was
meant to do - that I've never
known. And a part of me wonders if
I ever will."|speech|unknown|?|
10||"Jack looks around, confused, then turns toward the moonlight
as it dims a bit.
Jack carefully treads across the ice until he hits something
with his feet. He looks down, and at his feet is a wooden
staff. Curious, he picks it up. Almost immediately the
staff begins to glow a cold blue in his hands. Odd."|stage direction|||

12||"Jack almost drops it as the base of the staff comes in
contact with the ground. Frost shoots out and spreads across
the ice. Jack is visibly confused.
He touches a few trees with his staff sending frost up their
trunks. Then he swings the staff again, more confident, as
he begins to run across the frozen pond.
Another swing, and a gust of wind swirls him high up into the
air. Jack floats for a moment only to fall back down to
earth and into the trees. Jack grabs hold of a tree branch
and pulls himself up to see a small town off in the distance."|stage direction|||

The elves duck out of the way as North launches himself
across the floor on his rolling chair -- CLOSE as his huge
HAND gropes furiously among his WORK TOOLS, finally grabbing
a miniature HAMMER. As North's humming along with his music,
delicately CHISELING into the ice, we see a second arm sleeve
tatoo, the word NICE clearly visible--
His INTENSE BLUE EYE magnified in a JEWELER'S EYEPIECE -- a
delicate SCULPTING TOOL cuts fine details into the ice--
His hands place the finished piece on a curving ICE TRACK: An
ice LOCOMOTIVE. It belches ice vapor and chugs down the

The elves scurry in a panic, then all at once the BLACK SAND
WHOOSHES UP off the Globe -- rushes up through the ceiling as
the remaining sand bursts into a puff of smoke and dissipates

As the wind dies, the scattered pieces of debris settle to

earth. Keep following up, through majestic CLOUDS...

shimmering among the clouds, trailing the golden threads.
The strands are being controlled by a small portly figure,
THE SANDMAN. Suddenly, North's emergency signal zips by. The
Sandman turns to look and his eyes narrow, visibly concerned.
Sandy closes his eyes and in an instant the Dreamsand cloud
