In these old postcards, Hollywood is a dream town where movie
stars glide out of big cars to press their hands-and-

Another postcard:"|stage direction

5||"In this postcard myth, you'd toddle down to Hollywood and
Vine, bump into Bogie and Bacall, and join them for dinner at
the Brown Derby.  Or Ciro's.  Or the Coconut Grove...
More postcards.  Pictures of movie theaters, but not the ones
that you and I know today.  These are palaces.  Temples.
Grauman's Chinese and Egyptian.  The Carthay Circle.  The
Paramount, the Million Dollar.  From a time when moviegoing
was a complete experience, not a trip to the local mall.  The
ushers were friendly and helpful and wore gold brocaded
jackets and guided you to your seat.  The popcorn was hot and
fresh and buttered with real butter, not 30-weight motor oil."|stage direction

lights under the yawning, protective smile of Mt. Lee's most
famous resident, the fully-lit HOLLYWOOD SIGN.  We PUSH INTO

A gigantic aerial shot.  Postwar autos fill the muggy
midsummer evening air with the sounds of thousands of HONKING
HORNS, a mere precursor to the traffic yet to come.  Darkened
outlying neighborhoods are evidence of the postwar home
construction boom, as scores of stucco bungalows are being
built in the areas surrounding the beating heart of the town,
a swath of garishly bright concrete called
HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD."|stage direction
10|PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)|"Of course, it's not like the
postcards say it is.  This is what
it's like.  I'm Pete Appleton, and
this is my town."|speech
11||"Still in the same shot, we rocket down into the center of the
intersection of Hollywood and Vine, then head west along the
boulevard, skimming just above the traffic -- past Musso and
Frank's Grill and the Hollywood Canteen, past the Egyptian
Theater and a rumbling Pacific Electric Red Car, across
Highland Avenue, past the Paramount Theater, and across the
street to
GRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER."|stage direction
12|PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)|"Born and raised here, thank you
very much.  Sometimes, it seems
like everyone here is from
somewhere else.  But everyone loves
the movies, so Hollywood is
everyone's town, and they come here
by the busload.  To them, Grauman's
Chinese Theater is just about the
most exciting place on the planet.
To me, it's the theater that's
playing ""The African Queen."""|speech
13||"And like the man said, the film on the marquee is ""THE
AFRICAN QUEEN.""  Still the same shot, buses disgorge
TOURISTS, who move into the forecourt of the theater.  The
MEN doff their hats and mop their brows.  The WOMEN pull
their blouses away from their chests, fanning themselves with
movie-star maps as they marvel at the signed cement blocks.
We MOVE AMONG THEM, until we pick up A COUPLE, and we stay
behind them as they work their way through the crowd, on
their way to
THE THEATER ENTRANCE,
where an ornately attired DOORMAN smiles and tears their
tickets."|stage direction

15|PETE'S NARRATION (V.O.)|"That's me and my girlfriend.  Her
name is Sandra Sinclair, and this
is her town, too -- she's from
Cleveland.  She came out here to be
an actress, and that's just what
she's doing.  The first picture I
ever wrote, a little potboiler
called ""Sand Pirates of the
Sahara.""  Okay, it ain't ""Citizen
Kane,"" but you gotta start
somewhere."|speech
16||"MOVING INTO THE LOBBY
an explosion of glitz mixed with Chinese myth and legend.
Everywhere you look, it's red and orange and plush carpeting
and golden light.  We MOVE THROUGH the lobby, still in the
same shot, still tracking the couple, heading for the
auditorium doors, which are swept open by two ramrod-erect
USHERS and we move into
THE DARKENED THEATER.
As the couple, Pete and Sandra, find seats, we HEAR the
soundtrack of the film before we see the screen, the
unmistakable strains of a march, and then -- still in the
same shot -- we see the screen...
A NEWSREEL.
As the march SWELLS to a crescendo, we HEAR THE NEWSREEL
ANNOUNCER'S SONOROUS VOICE:"|stage direction

questions, cowering behind the
Fifth Amendment's protection

it's now time to pay the piper!"|speech

the exterior.  Moth-eaten velvet-flocked wallpaper hangs in
shards and pieces from the walls.  It's sort of a cross
between a gaudy cathouse and a mausoleum, served up with
generous helpings of dust and grime, an almost unbeatable
combination of questionable taste and neglect.
Above the center of the lobby hangs what was -- and is --
probably the only truly beautiful item in the whole

A DELICATE CRYSTAL CHANDELIER.
