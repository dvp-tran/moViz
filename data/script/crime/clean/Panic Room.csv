9||"Race across a field of PEDESTRIANS to pick up three women
hurrying down the sidewalk.  LYDIA LYNCH, a real estate
broker, vaults down the sidewalk, she's got a hell of a
stride.  MEG ALTMAN, thirtyish, struggles to keep up with
her, she's tall, wafer-thin, pale as a ghost.  SARAH, a nine
year old girl, flat out runs to keep up, dribbling a
basketball as she goes.  The kid's athletic, much tougher
than Meg, who she resembles.
Lydia reads from a sheet she carries in her bouncing hands."|stage direction||

15|LYDIA|No cars.  Feet are faster.|speech|LYDIA|F
16|MEG|How many more do we have after this?|speech|MEG|F
17|LYDIA|"None, there's nothing else, you know
how tight the market is."|speech|LYDIA|F
18|MEG|"This is it?  I told you on the
phone, I have to be moved in in two
weeks.  Sarah, please don't bounce
that here."|speech|MEG|F
19|SARAH|Mom, it's the sidewalk.|speech|SARAH|F
20|LYDIA|"Oh, that miserable little prick is
already leaving."|speech|LYDIA|F
21||"They approach a row of brownstones, narrow four story
townhouses, nice looking buildings, a hundred years old or
more.  EVAN, a sour-looking man, has just locked the front
door of number 26 and is coming down the steps.  He sees them
coming."|stage direction||

26||"Evan throws open the front door, revealing the airy foyer of
the townhouse.  The place is completely empty.  He talks
fast, races through the tour.  The three of them come in,
Sarah still bouncing her basketball."|stage direction||
27|EVAN|"This is the middle of the house, the
entry floor, living room's over
there.  The kitchen floor's below us
and there's two bedroom floors
above."|speech|EVAN|M
28||"The front door closes behind them, with a THUD so
authoritative it seems to say no one's ever getting out.  Meg
tries to get her daughter's attention, to tell her to stop
bouncing the ball in the house."|stage direction||
29|EVAN|"It's an enormous amount of space for
the money and I'll be perfectly
honest, the family is in no hurry
whatsoever."|speech|EVAN|M
30||"Meg whispers Sarah's name, but Sarah still ignores her, goes
on bouncing the ball."|stage direction||
31|EVAN|"I don't have to tell you there is an
acute shortage of living space in
Manhattan right now and this is a
highly unique property."|speech|EVAN|M
32|LYDIA|No ball, kid.|speech|LYDIA|F
33||"Sarah immediately stops bouncing.  She wanders into the
living room, peers through the big French doors, which look
out over the courtyard area.  There's another row of
brownstones on the next block, and all the patios back up to
one another.  It looks tranquil out there, oasis in the city.
Sarah leans up against the door, sighs, her breath fogs the
window.  There is a profound melancholy about her.  Meg
watches her, tries to catch eyes with her in the reflection.
Can't.
Evan flings open the door of an old-fashioned cage-style
elevator."|stage direction||
34|EVAN|"Working elevator.  Mr. Pearlstine,
the previous owner, was disabled the
last ten years of his life.  Highly
unusual, the elevator, you will not
find this in ninety percent of
brownstones."|speech|EVAN|M

a two week escrow and I'm already
approved for the loan."|speech|MEG|F

dicker, hmm?"|speech|EVAN|M

It's a very emotional property."|speech|EVAN|M

voice."|stage direction||

42|SARAH|"It's not like Saks', Mom, you don't
have to pay the price on the tag."|speech|SARAH|F
43||"She gets in the elevator and RATTLES the door shut with a
bang.  That kid's got an attitude.  Meg takes a deep breath,
turns to Lydia.  She brushes her hair behind an ear, we
notice her thin hand is shaking."|stage direction||
44|MEG|"I'm sorry.  Apartments, and...
money, and... this is more my
husband's area."|speech|MEG|F

water."|stage direction||
46|MEG|"Was.  His area.  I'm not very good
at..."|speech|MEG|F

finish her sentence.  Not very good at what?"|stage direction||
48|MEG|"Things, and if I can't prove to my
soon to-be ex-husband that I can
provide a suitable place for our
daughter to live in the next
fourteen days, it's going to get
ugly between us.  Uglier."|speech|MEG|F

65|LYDIA|"The hotel guy?  It's been in the
papers lately.  His kids are all
suing each other over his estate.
He was a total recluse, paranoid,
rich as hell, he was worth thirty
million or something, now it turns
out they can't find half of it."|speech|LYDIA|F

elevator, and the happy laughter of the little girl as she
puts it through its paces.  Evan winces, speaks as if his
mouth hurts when he moves it."|stage direction||

78|EVAN|And we emerge in the master bedroom.|speech|EVAN|M
79||"He checks his watch.
Meg looks around, studying the dimensions of the room.  She
looks at the far wall, the one that borders the house next
door.  She looks at the wall that corners it, opposite the
window wall.  She takes two steps back from it."|stage direction||
80|MEG|Something's weird.|speech|MEG|F
81|LYDIA|What?|speech|LYDIA|F
82|MEG|"I don't know, doesn't that corner
seem funny to you?"|speech|MEG|F
83||"She points to the far end of the wall, near the entrance to
the closet.  There is a mirrored door that leads to the
closet, and a mirror on the wall alongside it.  If you look
closely, you'll see that the mirrors are raked slightly
toward one another, which causes an optical illusion in which
the corner of the room appears much closer to the door than
it is."|stage direction||
84|EVAN|"I was waiting to see if you'd
notice!  On caravan, no one from our
office had the slightest idea."|speech|EVAN|M
85||"He pushes on the top of the mirror on the wall.  It makes a
faint CLICK, then glides open a few inches off the wall.  He
pulls it toward him, opens it all the way, a hundred eighty
degrees, and it fastens magnetically to the back of the
closed door.  There is smooth wall behind it, but if you look
closely, there is a faint vertical crack in the wall.
Meg looks at him -- what in the world?  Even pushes again,
twice this time, first at the top, then at the bottom, and
the smooth wall CLICKS ajar.  He pulls it wide open.  Meg and
Lydia step forward, fascinated."|stage direction||
86||INT.  PANIC ROOM - DAY|location||
87||"From the opposite end of a lone, narrow, windowless space, we
see the three of them standing in the open doorway,
silhouetted by the sunlight streaming through the bedroom
windows behind them."|stage direction||
88|EVAN|It's called a panic room.|speech|EVAN|M
89||He hits a switch and a row of bulbs flick on overhead.|stage direction||
90|MEG|A what?|speech|MEG|F
91|EVAN|"A safe room.  An inner sanctum.  A
castle keep, in medieval times."|speech|EVAN|M
92|LYDIA|Oh, I've seen these...|speech|LYDIA|F
93|EVAN|"It's quite in vogue in high end
construction right now.  One really
can't be too careful about home
invasion."|speech|EVAN|M
94||"The other two walk inside, but Meg lingers near the door,
looking around, studying the neatly arrayed survival supplies
-- water, food packs, batteries, flashlights, tools, rope,
clothes, blankets -- you get the idea."|stage direction||
95|LYDIA|Hey, this is perfect for you...|speech|LYDIA|F
96||(Meg scoffs)|location||
97|LYDIA|"Absolutely!  You're a woman, you're
living alone now.  Your alarm goes
off, or you head glass break, or for
whatever reason you think someone's
broken into your home in the middle
of the night.  What are you going to
do?  Call the police and wait until
they get here on Tuesday?  Traipse
downstairs in your sexy little
underthings and check it out?  I
think not!"|speech|LYDIA|F
98|EVAN|"Reinforced steel core walls.  Buried
phone line, completely separate, not
connected to the house's main line
and never exposed throughout the
house's infrastructure or outside
the house -- you can call the
police; nobody can cut you off.
Your own ventilation system,
complete with oxygen scrubber, so
you've got plenty of fresh air for
as long as you like.  And a bank of
video monitors --"|speech|EVAN|M
99||"He hits a switch next to a dozen tiny video monitors,
revealing a dozen different views of the house."|stage direction||

the house."|speech|EVAN|M

110|MEG|"What's to keep them from prying open
the door?"|speech|MEG|F
111||"Evan reaches past Meg and pushes a red button on the wall
behind her.  With a sudden WHANG of steel, a heavy metal door
leaps out of a slot in the wall and SLAMS shut, like a
submarine hatch.  A series of metal latches CLICK into place
inside it, from top to bottom, securing it into place."|stage direction||
112|EVAN|Steel, four inches thick.|speech|EVAN|M
113||Meg takes a step back.  They're now enclosed in the room.|stage direction||

the power's out it's fully
functional."|speech|EVAN|M

this room, did he?"|speech|LYDIA|F
117|MEG|Open the door.|speech|MEG|F
118|LYDIA|"And with kids like he's got, no
wonder he wanted a place to hide."|speech|LYDIA|F
119|EVAN|That's highly inappropriate.|speech|EVAN|M
120|MEG|I said open the door.|speech|MEG|F
121||"Evan hits a green button and the door GROANS slowly open,
recoiling its massive spring, and revealing Sarah, the little
girl, standing in the entryway, grinning widely."|stage direction||

her composure.  Not crazy about tight spaces.  Which we
already knew."|stage direction||

127|EVAN|Not at all.|speech|EVAN|M
128||"He points.  There's a tiny red beam that shines across the
doorway, one at shoulder height --"|stage direction||
129|EVAN|"Infrared.  Like the beam in an
elevator doorway.  Won't let the
door close if something's blocking
it."|speech|EVAN|M
130||"-- and one at shin height.  Even bend down, blocks the one at
shin height with his hand."|stage direction||
131|EVAN|Watch.|speech|EVAN|M
132||"He reaches up, to push the close button, but with one hand
anchored at the floor, he can't quite reach it."|stage direction||

134|EVAN|Push that button for me, will you?|speech|EVAN|M
135|MEG|Don't!|speech|MEG|F
136||"Lydia pushes the close button, nothing happens.  Evan pulls
his hand put of the beam, takes a step back.  Lydia pushes
the button again.
WHANG!  The metal door rockets shut, the metallic slang
reverberating in the room.  Almost immediately, the fake
piece of wall HUMS shut, of its own accord, followed a moment
later by the mirror, which detaches itself from the back of
the closet door and HUMS silently back into place, closing
over the hidden door, making the corner of the room look like
a corner again.
As the mirrored door closes, it shows Meg her own reflection.
She looks at herself, still rattled.  She wipes a trickle of
sweat from the side of her face."|stage direction||

pizza.  They chew, silently.  Sarah drinks a diet Dr.
Pepper.  Meg finishes a glass of wine.
Meg's eyes are moist.  Sarah notices.  She notices her

screens all suddenly wink to life, showing a dozen views of
the house.  Whatever she pushed turned these on too, probably
not what she meant to do, but at least she got the alarm on
for the night.
The door that leads from the panic room to the master bedroom
hangs open.  In the middle of the floor in here, somebody has
made a small tent of blankets and couch cushions.  Sarah must
have been playing here before bed."|stage direction||

She sets the digital clock, puts it next to the glass of
water.  It's 12:26.
She gets in bed, her side, the left side.
She lies in the dark, half an acre of empty bed across from

187||"-- 2:26.  Meg is in a hard, boozy sleep.  We drift out the
door of the master bedroom, into the third floor hallway, and
down the open stairwell.  We glide through the entry floor,
still gently falling through the stairwell's airway, dropping
even further, all the way down to the kitchen floor, the
ground floor.
We drift across the darkened kitchen, serpentine through the
canyon of moving boxes, approach the window that looks out on
the street.
We move right up against the window, peer through the glass
just as --
-- a van pulls up across the street and stops.  Can't see
through its windows.  No movement for a moment, then the
driver's door opens and a MAN climbs out.  He wears dark
clothes.
The Man closes the door, looks both ways, and starts across
the street towards us.  He's carrying a bag of some kind.
He goes to the door, and we drift down toward the doorknob.
We hear a key slide into the door, rattle.
But the lock doesn't turn.  The key slides out, back in
again, jiggles.  Still won't open the door.
The Man steps away from the door, goes to the kitchen window,
which is heavily barred, and peers inside, right at us.
Can't see anything, it's darker in here than it is out there.
He turns, looks both ways on the street again, then steps up,
onto the window ledge.  Now we can only see his legs, can't
tell what he's doing.  He's reaching up, stretching for
something.  It drops into view with a metallic SCRAPE.
The fire escape.
The Man climbs, his feet disappearing from our field of
vision.
We turn around, facing the other way in the kitchen.  We
start back the way we came, through the canyon of boxes in
the kitchen, toward the stairwell."|stage direction||

earlier.  We're drifting up, off the kitchen floor, through
the entry floor, and as we rise we notice something all the
way up on the roof that we couldn't see before, when we were
looking down.
A skylight.  We continue to rise, drawn toward it.  We move
up, through the master bedroom floor, creeping up alongside
the stair banister, now reaching the top floor of the house,
and just as we near the skylight --
-- a figure appears, visible through it.  The Man in dark
clothes, on the roof now.  He stops, peers down through the
skylight, looking at us without seeing us again.
He steps across the skylight.  This is not the way he intends
to enter.  We drift again, following his soft footsteps on
the roof, which we can hear faintly through the ceiling.
Here in the hall, just outside Sarah's bedroom, a closet door
is ajar.  We squeeze through the gap and into the closet.
IN THE CLOSET,
it's completely dark.  Can't see a thing.  But then a sliver
of light appears, coming from above.  We look up.
There is a ladder that's bolted to the wall in this closet,
it leads up to a square panel in the ceiling.
Roof access.  And that roof access panel is moving, ever so
slightly, moonlight spilling in as it twists in its setting.
A shiny silver something slides through the crack along the
edges of the portal.
It slithers along the edge of the hatchway, searching for
something.  It finds a small round nub in the crack.  The
silver something stops.  It HUMS with electricity for a
moment, then there is a bright spark and a soft CRACK."|stage direction||

access panel is removed.  A million stars are visible in the
night sky above.  But we're inside.
And in a moment, so is this intruder.  The Man peers down,
through the open hatchway, then slips through the opening and
climbs silently down the ladder."|stage direction||

197||"One floor up, the Man steps into the hallway and starts for
the stairs, moving quickly and confidently.  Knows where he's
going, knows what he wants.  He starts down the stairs,
happens to glance to the side as he does so.
He freezes.  He's looking in the open doorway of the top
floor bathroom, staring hard at something that clearly
disturbs him.
A nightlight.  Plugged into an outlet in the baseboard in the
bathroom.  (For the record, it's the Power Puff Girls.)  The
Man climbs the stairs again, concerned, goes to the door of
the bathroom.  He looks from the nightlight to the
countertop.

This is news to him, bad news.

Meg lies in bed, eyes wide open, no idea a Man is standing in

TWO MORE MEN climb out.  They are also dressed in dark

They walks calmly across the street, grow large in the window

looks like gravity does all the work, just pulling him

like a homey, very street, but can't hide the fact that the

sheetrock on the outer wall of the panic room.
The intruders are in the master bedroom now, and Burnham is
like a man possessed, tearing at the sheetrock with the sharp
end of the tool while Junior shines a flashlight into the
hole.
As the sheetrock tears away, we see the skeleton of the wall
behind it.  There's a latticework of two by four studs, and
beyond those the dull shine of the wall's metal core.
But that's not what he's after.  He continues tearing,
reveals an air duct running through the wall, feeding into
the panic room through a welded hole in the steel.  Burnham
tears away with the hammer, exposing a short section of the
duct.
CLANG!  The claw hammer drops into an opened toolbox.
Burnham drops to his knees, rips open another tool case.
This one has a sophisticated looking power drill in it, along
with a couple dozen specialized bits.  He selects one, twists
it into the drill.
At the wall, Burnham puts drill to metal and hits the switch.
A horrendous METAL SCREECH fills the air and the drill bit
tears into the duct, opening up a jagged hole about the size
of a quarter.
Raoul hurries through the doorway of the bedroom, carrying a
coiled garden hose.  Burnham snaps his fingers for it, Raoul
tosses it to him, holding one end, and the hose uncoils in
the air as it snakes across the room.
Burnham shoves the end of the garden hose into the hole he's
just drilled in the air duct.
RIP!  He tears off a length of duct tape and seals the
connection, makes it airtight.
SLIT!  Using a large hunting knife, Raoul hacks a ten foot
section of the garden hose off the coil.
He stretches it out, across the room, to the white five
gallon tank we saw before, which is now sitting on the floor
up here.  We move in close as Burnham snugs the cut end of
the garden hose over a spigot at the top of the tank.  Red
block letters are easy to read on the side of the tank.

Finally, she finds a small metal handle, folded back into the
clover-leaf seal on the portal.  She unfolds it, twists it.
The portal cranks open, revealing it to be at the end of a
tube, about a foot long, an emergency ventilation source
directly through to the exterior of the house.  She bends
down and looks through it.  It's covered by a metal mesh at

the waterproof matches and lighters.
She thinks.  Takes a deep lungful of fresh air from the tube
and crawls over to the lighters.  She selects one, snatches
up a screwdriver.
Sarah looks at her, has a vague idea of what she's thinking,

In response, Meg picks up two or three of the fireproof
blankets and piles them over Sarah, right up to her
disbelieving eyes.  She bends down, takes another gulp of
air.  but she's getting woozy.  This can't go on much longer.
She staggers across the room, hoists herself back up onto the
shelf she stood on before, and gets right up next to the

she unscrews the vent cover.
The duct is wide enough to put your arm in.  She reaches in,
past a bundle of multicolored wires that run down through the

the blue cloud on the ceiling suddenly evaporates with
another angry WHOOMP, leaving a few little pockets of flame
that Meg extinguishes by swatting with a blanket.  Only one
of the fluorescent lights is left intact; it casts a
flickering, uneven light on the room.
She stands in the middle of the still-smoky panic room,
breathing hard.  She shouts, SCREAMS incomprehensibly, making
no sense whatsoever.
She stops, noticing the look Sarah is giving her.  Wide-eyed
admiring, frightened, you are an insane woman.
Meg looks to herself.  Her arm is signed, the hair burned
off.  The sleeve of her T-shirt is burned back to the
shoulder.  Her face is sooty, blackened.
Meg GRUNTS, half frightened by herself."|stage direction||

a sound coming from the long wall of the panic room, the wall
that's shared with the brownstone next door.

floor, legs folded in front of her, completely drained.
But Sarah's not drained, Sarah's full of nervous ingenuity,
rustling around through the stuff in the panic room, an idea
forming in her head.  She finds a powerful-looking flashlight
and loads it up with batteries.  She tries it, flashing
around the room.
Halogen bulb, very powerful, hurts her mother's eyes as she
flashes it past.  Meg watches her.  What's she up to?
Sarah lays on the floor in front of the ventilation tube she
discovered earlier.  She squints through it.
THROUGH THE TUBE,
she can see out of the house, into the courtyard behind the
brownstone.
About thirty yards away she can see the backs of the
brownstones on the next block, and directly across (because
the tube doesn't leave much room for lateral vision) she can
see straight into somebody's bedroom.
There's a light on.  A SLEEPING MAN is in bed, an open book
on his chest.
IN THE PANIC ROOM,
Sarah sits back.
She grabs the flashlight, looks for a little button on the
top, the kind you can flick the flashlight on and off with.
Shining it on the wall of the panic room, she flashes it at a
wall, three times, on and off.  Satisfied, she turns back to
the tube.
Meg, curious, crawls across the floor to join her.  Sarah
shoves the flashlight all the way into the tube, leaving
enough room on either side of it for them to see through.
Meg lays down flat, squints into the tube, Sarah alongside
her.  She looks at her daughter, curious -- your plan?
Sarah reaches into the tube, finds the little flash button on
the top of the flashlight.
THROUGH THE TUBE,
the piercing halogen beam begins to flash, across the
courtyard and into the bedroom of the Man in the bedroom.
The light flashes on the wall over his bed.
The flashes are in a rhythm.  Short.  Short.  Short.  Long.

Sarah is frustrated.  She adjusts the flashlight.
THROUGH THE TUBE,
the beam of light lowers jerkily from the wall until it is
shining directly into the Sleeping Man's eyes.
IN THE PANIC ROOM,
Sarah strains to keep the light in that perfect spot.  She's
starting to sweat.  Meg leans over, sneaks a peek at the
watch Sarah wears on her left wrist.  The readout:

A moment later, the light goes out and the room is black.

Meg manages to raise her head, breaking the beam."|stage direction||

He runs down three steps.
Stops again.
Runs down the rest of the stairs."|stage direction||
1165||INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT|location||
1166||"Raoul stretches to push the red ""close"" button for the door,
but he has to hold Meg's head down, out of the lower beam
with one hand, all with Sarah savagely attacking him at the
same time, and three syringes hanging out of his neck.
Finally, he gets Meg's head all the way down, onto the floor.
Looking up, Meg sees the red beam become complete again.
Raoul jabs the button --
-- just as Sarah throws her hand into the upper beam, the one
at shoulder level.  Sarah's hand turns red, the beam is
broken, the door will not close.
Raoul ROARS in anger and twists violently, sending Sarah
flying across the room.
Meg strains, gets her head off the floor again, breaking the
beam.  Raoul starts jamming the close button, over and over
again, the beam completes, then breaks, completes, then
breaks, never the button and the beam at the same time.
But it can't go on forever.  Meg's tiring, she can't keep it
up, her head trembles --
-- and collapses onto the floor.
The beam completes --
-- Raoul SMACKS the red button --
-- and Burnham appears on the other side of the door.  He
reaches in, grabs hold of Raoul, to pull him off her, but
Raoul loses his balance, falls forward --
-- into the gap --
-- and his head is crushed by the spring-loaded steel door
that SLAMS forward just as Meg draws herself back.
Meg falls across the panic room, grabs Sarah, and holds on
tight.
The door detects the obstruction and opens again, slowly.
Raoul's body slumps to the floor, dead.
Burnham stands there, looking down at Meg and Sarah.
They stare at each other, wordless, their first face to face
contact.  She sees the bonds protruding from his jacket.
She just looks at him.  There will be no understanding here.
He zips his jacket, turns, and hurries away."|stage direction||

1168||"Burnham races down the steps, hurries to the entry door,
throws it open --
-- and finds a gun barrel pointed directly into his nose.  He
blinks, tries to focus on whoever's on the other end of that
gun.
It's the Cop, the first Cop, the one who came to the door and
was so suspicious of Meg.  The Cop looks down, sees blood
smeared all over Burnham's jacket, sees more than enough to
know his suspicions were correct."|stage direction||

1170||"Burnham freezes, silhouetted in the doorway.  Wind and leaves
blow into the house, a real gale outside.
From behind Cop 1, MORE COPS SHOUT, all at once, must be a
half dozen of 'em there, but Burnham can't see anything in
the stinging light, and can't hear much either, over the
ROARING wind.
Burnham moves suddenly, flinging the door shut right in the
Cop's face.  The door SLAMS hard, Burnham turns to run but
doesn't get more than a few paces before three sharp GUNSHOTS
CRACK through the door behind him.
Brilliant white light spills through the bulletholes in the
door, but it's not the light that gets you, it's the chunks
of lead.  They rip through Burnham's back and come out his
chest, a triangle pattern.
Burnham stops, sags to his knees.  He reaches into his
jacket, pulls out the loose stack of bonds.
He fans them out, stares down at them, holds them like
playing cards."|stage direction||

1172||"Behind him, the front door CRACKS open, half a dozen COPS
appear and start SHOUTING, all at once.  Burnham tosses the
bonds to the floor, the same gesture as folding a hand of
poker.
He GROANS and collapses, slowly, falling through the bonds,
twisting as he goes down.  He SLAPS onto his back in the
foyer as the wind gusts through the open door, scoops the
bonds up off the floor, and blows them back into the house,
as if they were never meant to leave.
Burnham lies there on the floor, eyes open, staring up at the
ceiling, looking at the bonds that swirl in the blast of air,
suspended there, twisting and bucking and diving just over
his head as he dies."|stage direction||

1175||"The swirling bonds melt into swirling leaves, blowing in the
air over Central Park on a crisp fall day.  The leaves float
down, over the Great Lawn, that massive expanse of grass we
saw in Meg's hallucination.
But on a day like this the Great Lawn's full of people,
throwing frisbees, playing football, lying there doing
nothing.
The leaves land on the grass next to Meg and Sarah, stretched
out on a blanket, a newspaper spread in front of them, open
to the ads.
Meg is on her back, arms folded behind her head, staring up
at the clouds.
Sarah is intent on the paper, circling the occasional ad."|stage direction||

1177||"Meg rolls over, props herself up on one elbow.  She seems
years younger.  She looks at Sarah, reaches out, brushes her
daughter's hair behind one ear.
She smiles.  She is calm.
Behind her, a flock of pigeons takes off, leaping into the
clear autumn sky."|stage direction||
