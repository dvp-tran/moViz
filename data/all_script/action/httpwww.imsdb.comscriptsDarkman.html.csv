Strackâ€ž naked except for a monogrammed bath towel
wrapd around his thickening midriff, walks across
the plush bedroom of his penthouse apartment. A
Mahler symphony plays in the background.
He bends to hoist a huge inlaid mahogany chest that
rests on a marble stand, 'then, grunting under the
strain of the load, he staggers back across the room
to the king-sized bed.
With a mighty heave he tips the contents of the chest
out onto the bed. A torrent of golden ICrugerands.
They wash over the bed, so many that some spill over
the sides and clatter to the floor.
Strack pauses for a beat, staring down at the booty,
then reaches down to the towel and lets it drop to the
floor.
Like a swan he dives.
He rolls, luxuriating in the feel of gold against
flesh, laughter bubbling from his lips.
Gold coins stick to his flushed, sweating flesh, then
slough off, leaving their imprint.
Strack makes swimming motions with his arms, laving
