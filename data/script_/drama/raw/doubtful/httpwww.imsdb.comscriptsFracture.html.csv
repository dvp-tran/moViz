1||"CREDITS SEQUENCE: EXTREME CLOSE-UPS
An unfinished mechanical device: a scaffold of thin metal
pipes, levers, pulleys, wiring, serve-motors.
THOMAS CRAWFORD works on it: in his 40s, well-dressed but in
disarray, graying stubble, hair and clothes unkempt.
Magnifying glasses distort his eyes, making them huge and
strange.
He sets aside a tool, takes a marble-sized ball-bearing and
drops it into a slot at the top of the device.
His enlarged eyes follow the metal ball -
- as it rolls and flips and spirals through a Rube-Goldberg-
style maze, setting off bells, clicking past turnstiles -
- then missing a leap and clattering across the work-table.
Eyes on the device, Crawford's hand traps the ball.
He stays still, analyzing.
He selects a tiny screwdriver from a neat array of metal-
working and electronics tools. Makes a miniscule adjustment
to a single joint. Drops in another ball.
It rolls and flips and spirals all the way down.
Crawford doesn't react.   Just studies the machine.
Behind him, on a desk: a framed photograph of a beautiful
woman in her mid-30s.
His wife."|stage direction

3||"JENNIFER CRAWFORD is just reaching orgasm -
- with ROB NUNALLY: mid-30s, good-looking, aging-boyish.
They clutch each other, shuddering, lost in passion. And
then, breathing heavily, caressing each other - Nunally rolls
off her - slowly coming back to earth.
Jennifer studies her lover, a quiet play of relief and
gratitude and satisfaction on her face -
- darkened by a troubled distance, maybe even fear.
She is, after all, having an affair."|stage direction

5||INT. CRAWFORD'S OFFICE - DAY|location
6||"Crawford stares through the grotesque lenses, motionless,
expressionless.
He takes a deep breath and checks his watch.   Then he stands,
removing the glasses.
We now see his office: large, austere. Decor and equipment
related to aircraft engineering. Outside big windows, jets
take off from an industrial airstrip.
Crawford gets a brand-new bottle of Jack Daniels from a desk
drawer, uncaps it and swigs as he opens the door to a private
bathroom.
He gargles, spits into the sink. He pours out more, then
puts the half-empty bottle back on his desk.
He collects a home-made device from the workbench: it looks
like a PDA connected by wires to a blank credit card.
He puts it in the pocket of his suit jacket, which he sets on
the desk. Adjusts the placement of the open bottle, nearby.
Crawford goes to a light-box, studying a set of large X-rays:
dark strips of welding in a grayish fuzz of metal.
TINA, his assistant, appears in the doorway."|stage direction

9|CRAWFORD|Yep.|speech
10||"She hesitates a second, glancing at the bottle.
Crawford ignores her, pulling an x-ray off the light-box and
grabbing his jacket -
- which knocks over the bottle.   It skitters across the desk,
liquor spilling.
Crawford just walks out past Tina."|stage direction

EXECUTIVES in suits cluster around work-boards covered with
photographs and diagrams of a crash site.
They look up, falling silent, as Crawford comes in carrying
the X-ray. A few exchange surprised, concerned glances; this
is not a man who skips a shave.
But when he gets to them, Crawford is laser-like - holding
the X-ray and pointing to a spot three inches above it:"|stage direction

In a corner is another of Crawford's Rube Goldbergs - this
one the size of a refrigerator. On a coffee table in the
center of the room, a big wooden bowl of ball-bearings.
Jennifer hurries in, dropping her keys on a table and -

Crawford waits in the center of the room; despite the outer

curl of smoke leaking from the gun in his extended hand. The
hand, we might notice now, wears a surgical glove.
He lowers the gun, bends to pick up the ejected shell-casing
from the floor. He wipes it and tosses it aside, on his way
to Jennifer.
He stands looking down at her: face-up on the floor, head in

Eyes on each other from across the room - moving very slowly -
the two men cautiously set down their guns -

forward - alert to the possibility of a lunge for the gun or
having another weapon. But Crawford stays absolutely still."|stage direction

the femoral artery. It's on the inner

inside her dress -"|speech

Crawford furiously, cursing -

knocking into PARAMEDICS trying to get to Jennifer -
- Nunally kicking, flailing, spitting at Crawford - who's put
face-down on the floor, to get cuffed.
Nunally pulls free from the SWAT cops, distraught, angry -
going to retrieve his gun and shove it in his shoulder-
holster, struggling to regain control."|stage direction

WILLY SLOCUM works at a laptop on his second-hand desk, lit
by a solitary lamp.
He is in his late-20s, good-looking. Short hair, office-pale
but athletic, wearing mis-matched sweats from Eastern
Oklahoma State College.
He jots a final note, sets his yellow legal pad aside. As he
goes to the closet-sized bathroom, pulling off his sweatshirt
and starting the tiny pre-fab shower, we linger on the laptop
screen: rental listings for a new apartment.
TIME CUT
The bare overhead bulb is on, revealing the concrete floor
and painted-plywood walls. His clothes hang neatly on a
length of pipe suspended by ropes from the exposed rafters.
Law school texts fill cinderblock-and-board shelves.
The radio chatters.    Willy knots a tie in his crisp white
collar.
TIME CUT
Willy methodically packs legal folders from last night's
""homework"" into his big, battered briefcase. He has to work
to stuff all the files in.
He pulls on his suit jacket, settles the shoulders, tugs at
his cuffs. Uncaps a pen, leans over a one-sentence letter
waiting on the desk. Reads it over.
As he signs, we glimpse:"|stage direction

position at the District Attorney's Office as of
Novemb-

Nope. He sighs. Takes a ball-bearing, rolls it in his hand.

one bullet."|speech

Willy nods, thinking it out.   Sure of himself.
He sets the ball-bearing into the slot at the top of the

CLOSE: Crawford's fingers, putting the bullets in the clip.

The gun in Nunally's limp dead fingers, glimpsed on the

Some place they break."|speech
2006||"Without looking, Willy gently pushes the machine, moving it a
fraction of an inch on the floor -

in a perfect, graceful arc -

Outside, the police car doors open and then slam.
Crawford, going pale, watches the metal ball roll off the
coffee-table and across the floor toward him.
Crawford doesn't move.     Trying to focus.    His mind working.
The ball comes to rest against Crawford's shoe.
The doorbell rings.
Crawford looks up.     Meeting Willy's eyes.
Smiling slightly, Willy tucks Nunally's gun into his belt and
puts his hands in the air.
And gives Crawford a wink.
Crawford is staring at Willy, frozen - panic and hatred and
fear curdling in his eyes -
- as behind him, the police begin pounding on the front door."|stage direction
