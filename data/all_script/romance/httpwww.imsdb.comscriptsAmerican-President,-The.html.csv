114|A.J.|"Lewis, McSorley, McCluskey and Shane
hold too many markers. If we try to
push this through and lose, there will
be a very loud thud when we hit the
ground, and that's not what you want in
an election year."|speech
115|SHEPHERD|"Talk to the GDC again, A.J. Tell them
the President resents the implication
that he's turned his back on the
environment. Tell them I'll send 455 to
the floor. But we're gonna ask for a
10 percent reduction. If they want to pull
their support, fine. At 63 percent job
approval rating. I don't need their help
getting a bill passed. We gotta get going--

over the past few years."|stage direction

126|KODAK|They keep moving that big ficus plant.|speech
127|A.J.|We're all here, Mr. President.|speech
128|SHEPHERD|"Okay. First, I wanted to say
congratulations. Three years ago, we
were elected to the White House by
one of the narrowest margins in history,
and today Kodak tells us 63 percent of
registered voters think we're doing a
good job."|speech
129|KODAK|"Wait a second. You wanted me to poll
registered voters?"|speech
130||Everyone LAUGHS... even SHEPHERD smiles...|stage direction
131|SHEPHERD|"But the poll also tells us what we
already knew: We don't get this
crime bill of ours through Congress
and these numbers are gonna be a
memory. So, starting today, we're
shifting it into gear."|speech
132|ROBIN|"Can I tell my morning press gaggle
that gun control--"|speech
133|A.J.|"Crime control, Robin. Gun control
means we're wimps and we're soft on
crime."|speech

Now, I understand we took it out when
we were in the low forties, but we
can push it through now."|speech
139|SHEPHERD|After the elections.|speech
140|LEWIS|"Sir, we may never have an opportunity
like this again. Let's take this 63
percent out for a spin and see what
it can do."|speech
141|SHEPHERD|"We can't take it out for a spin, Lewis.
We need it to get re-elected. For
reasons passing understanding, people
do not relate guns to gun-related crime."|speech
142|A.J.|"Robin, you can brief the press this
afternoon. As of today, the crime
bill's priority one on the President's
domestic agenda."|speech
143|ROBIN|Got it.|speech
144|A.J.|"Leon, you're gonna run the war room.
We're gonna need detailed projections
for all the target districts by the

a nice, sweet guy from Brooklyn. Do
what the N.R.A. does."|speech

liaison on this. You're gonna run
the show on the hill."|speech

be easier to fight a war on drugs if
we weren't arming drug dealers."|speech

we can win."|speech

serious men to solve them. And
whatever your particular problem is,
friend, I promise you, Bob Rumson is
not the least bit interested in
solving it. He is interested in two
things and two things only: Making
you afraid of it and telling you
who's to blame for it. That, ladies
and gentlemen, is how you win
elections. You gather a group of
middle-aged, middle-class, middle-
income voters who remember with
longing an easier time, and you talk
to them about family and American
values and personal character. Then
you have an old photo of the
President's girlfriend. You scream
about patriotism and you tell them
she's to blame for their lot in life,
you go on television and you call her
a whore. Sydney Ellen Wade has done
nothing to you, Bob. She has done
