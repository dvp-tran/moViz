The crate is surrounded by our three diver-bandits.
Using crowbars they pull apart the plywood. The cardboard
boxes of tomatoes dump out, tomatoes spilling everywhere.
And now we see what was hidden between the boxes...
A large safe.
They move like clock-work. Half-Ear aims an underwater light
at the dial. Charlie drills a small hole near the dial.
John peers inside a horoscope and lines up the three wheels
of the combination lock... until the door pops open.
As they stare at what's inside, they speak into their

They attach an underwater parachute to the bag and hook a
hose from an air tank into press of a pressure release valves

Looking like a hot-air balloon underwater, the whole thing
floats up about fifteen feet. Half-Ear holds onto its side,

Then Charlie and John Bridger speed off on the DPVs which
