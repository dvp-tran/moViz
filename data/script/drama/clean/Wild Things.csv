Culver City, CA 90232
FADE IN:
MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE -- BLACK
INTERCUT -- QUICK FLASH-FORWARDS
INSIDE A STEAMY SHOWER -- A wet naked woman and man wrapped
around each other in ecstasy -- legs, arms, hair, mouths.
BLACK -- MORE TITLES -- then
Moonlight reflects on a vehicle's shiny surface.  FISTS THUD into
flesh.  O.S. -- a man slams of the hood, rebounds away.
BLACK -- MORE TITLES -- then
LOVERS -- caught in FREEZE-FRAMES of green neon -- off, on, off,
on -- like a strobe's instant-images -- of gasping, tough sex.
BLACK -- MORE TITLES -- then
ON A GLEAMING POOL DECK of black-and-white tile -- two women in
soaked, clinging clothes -- fight -- hands squeeze a throat.
BLACK -- MORE TITLES -- then
A SCREAM -- a sickening hollow THWACK -- an arc of blood, two
teeth fall on dark stone.
BLACK -- MORE TITLES -- then
GUNSHOTS -- Blood sprays across the glass of a picture frame --
obscures the photo inside.
BLACK -- MORE TITLES -- then
THE SURFACE OF A SPARKLING SEA -- a distant emerald island.  A
40-foot sloop APPEARS -- shapes on deck -- we are about to SEE --
BLACK -- MORE TITLES -- then
SHARKS -- underwater -- rip something into a bloody cloud.
END MAIN TITLES."|stage direction||

3||EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY|location||
4||"A place of money and privilege.  White coral buildings surround
an open yard.  Tile roofs rise among banyan trees and banana
palms, shimmering before a blue blaze of sky.
Beyond the yard is the school's playing field and beyond that the
waters of Biscayne Bay, dappled in sunlight where the sloops of
the school's sailing class bob at their moorings.
For a moment all is quiet.  Then, faintly, the HUM of many
VOICES, rising and falling, LAUGHTER.
The CAMERA PANS to the open windows of a building somewhat larger
than the others.  The SOUNDS grow louder."|stage direction||
5||INT. BLUE BAY AUDITORIUM - DAY|location||
6||"A hundred high school kids sit before a raised, hardwood stage.
The students are not unlike the campus, radiant, well-tended -- a
veritable sea of adolescent sexuality -- bronze boys who seem to
have just come from the boats or tennis courts -- girls in tight
shorts riding high up shapely thighs, as...
SAM LOMBARDO strolls out onto the stage.  The man is thirtyish,
drop-dead handsome.  Dressed not that differently from the kids,
in an Izod polo shirt, khakis and boat shoes.
His entrance has an effect upon the audience, particularly upon
the girls.
KAREN and JANELLE, 16, pretty blondes, whisper then giggle.
NICOLE, a dark-eyed beauty, 17 but going on 25, watches Sam's
walk, then turns to the girl at her side...
KELLY VAN RYAN, 17, a fully-developed knockout."|stage direction||

JIMMY LEACH, 18, grumge look, long hair.  He sits with a clique
of white trashy types, or at least what passes for such at Blue
Bay School.  Jimmy appears a bit more genuine, as does...
SUZlE TOLLER, a boyish brunette, seated nearby, but with just
enough space between her and everyone else to mark her as a
loner.  She studies Sam Lombardo with a dark, sullen stare."|stage direction||

GLORIA PEREZ walks at his side.  She's a good six inches shorter

ANGLE ON PHOTOGRAPH
An old black-and-white, with that sepia caste harkening back to
another age.
A handsome young man of perhaps 14 stands at the helm of a boat
under sail.  His hair is swept back, his eyes fixed upon an
unseen horizon.  There is something in this boy's pose, in the
line of his jaw, in the clarity of his gaze, as if what he has
fixed upon is the future itself."|stage direction||

student from each boat jumps onto the dock where he or she sets

that Jimmy and Kelly are squeezed into the passenger seat, which
is fine with Jimmy.  Kelly's thigh is pressed against his.  His
arm pushes against her breast.  Kelly is not so happy.
As they near the school's entrance, they come upon a beat-to-shit
VW bug -- stalled at a stop sign.
A John Deere tractor mower sits nearby.  A groundsman -- a tall
black guy with a shaved head, waits at the wheel of the bug as...
Suzie Toller -- in black platform shoes, a T-shirt and cutoff
jeans, leans over the engine, fiddling with the car's linkage.
Sam pulls up next to the bug and stops."|stage direction||

diver's weight belt tumbles out.  Sam grabs it, swings it over
his head in circles, letting the weight pick up momentum,
preparing to throw.

a mean grin spreading across his face.

Ray moves quickly across the deck -- a menacing sight -- tall,
well-muscled, the handle gleaming in his hand.
Sam pulls himself out of the cockpit.  Ray jumps in.  But that's
as far as he gets.
WHOOSH -- A spear pierces Ray's thigh.  He screams, goes down,
the handle skittering across the deck.
