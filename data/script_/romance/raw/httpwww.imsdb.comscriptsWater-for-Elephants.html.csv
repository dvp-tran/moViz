78|JACOB|"But I'm telling you, my father put
away every penny he ever earned.
They owned that house outright. Why
would he have a mortgage?"|speech
79|HYDE|"My guess is because he let people
pay him in beans & eggs or whatever
they had, instead of money."|speech

turning away people who couldn't
afford his help? He was a doctor."|speech
81|HYDE|"Yes, I know, he was a very good man

irresponsible man. I'm sorry, but

JACOB (V.O.)
They did it to pay for my Ivy
League education.
For a moment Jacob can't move. This thought stuns him. With
his house being picked apart and the Bank Representative
speaking about papers, Jacob can't take it any longer. He
drops the sign and walks away. The Bank Rep calls after him:"|speech
90|BANK REPRESENTATIVE|"Jacob? Jacob they need these signed
by the end of the business day.
Jacob walks away from the Bank Rep, pulling off his tie and
tossing it. He is crying - the reality finally hitting him.
JACOB (V.O.)
I walked and I kept on walking...
It's a strange feeling becoming an
orphan the same time you're
becoming a man...To have this
freedom to be anything you want at
the same time everything you were
is taken away. So I just walked
...Then all of a sudden, I stopped."|speech
91||EXT. A CLEARING NEAR A STREAM - OUTSKIRTS OF ITHACA - NIGHT|location
92|BANK REPRESENTATIVE|"Jacob stands with his feet in a clear stream. He is no longer
crying. There are dense woods, pitch black, all around him.
JACOB (V.O.)
Like I'd been sleepwalking and I
woke up. I had no idea where I was.
Jacob can hear the buzz of insects, the glow of fireflies and
the cries of distant animals in the woods. It unnerves him.
Far off beyond the dense woods Jacob sees A MOVING FLICKERING
LIGHT - like a distant, silent star moving past the trees.
The Light is moving around the woods until it curves towards
Jacob's direction. He hears a distant CLANK-CLANK...
Curious, Jacob puts his shoes on and walks back to a gravel
path that leads to TRAIN TRACKS just as:
THE MASSIVE TRAIN ENGINE EXPLODES INTO VIEW PASSING HIM.
Jacob is so close, he is hit by a wall of wind that nearly
knocks him down. It is dark and the train is moving fast.
10.
JACOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
What is it inside of us makes us
decide to grab onto life again and
again, no matter how many times it
abandons us without a second
thought?...What is it makes us
hungry for more of the same?
Somebody smart should figure that
one out.
Jacob makes his decision: He runs parallel to the
train...stumbling over gravel, pitching forward and losing
his balance, recovering, then running faster, scanning for
something to grab hold of to hoist himself up. He sees:
AN OPEN STOCK CAR IS THREE CARS BEHIND HIM...As it catches up
to him, he lunges forward, reaching for the iron grab hold
and flings himself upward. He clings on with his left leg,
elbow and chin. His right hand clings to the grab hold. With
his left hand, he claws the floorboards of the stock car, but
the aged wood scraps off under his fingers. His right leg is
dangling, beneath the train itself, dangerously close to the
tracks. Jacob is slipping...slipping...
With everything he's got, Jacob makes one final ""life or
death""ù effort, managing to get his left knee up over the
edge. Using foot, knee, chin, elbow and fingernails, he
scrapes his way inside the stock car and lies panting..."|speech
93||INT. STOCK CAR - EN ROUTE - NIGHT|location
94|BANK REPRESENTATIVE|"A dim light barely illuminates the interior. Jacob breaths a
brief sigh of relief and accomplishment when suddenly: A HUGE
HAND CONNECTED TO A EVEN LARGER ARM COMES OUT OF THE
DARKNESS, GRABBING JACOB BY HIS COLLAR, HOISTING HIM UP.
Jacob swings at this Brute with his free arm but it's blocked
easily, as the Brute moves him to the open car door.
OLD TIMER (O.S.)
Oh, don't go messin with Blackie.
Throwing people off of trains is
one of the perks of his job.
Jacob can now see THREE MEN playing cards by a kerosene lamp.
ONE MAN HAS A RIFLE, aimed at Jacob. Another, A SHRUNKEN,
STUBBLE FACED OLD TIMER, drinks out of a jug...
Blackie holds Jacob out on the edge of the open stock car, as
trees slam against the train almost cutting Jacob's face.
11."|speech
95|BLACKIE|"We don't need no bums on this train
brother. You can get off right now

Old Timer rises with a lantern and hobbles on one bad leg,
inspects Jacob and his nice suit with the lantern..."|speech
96|OLD TIMER|"Now everybody calm down here. Grady
put that damn rifle away. BLACKIE
LET'IM GO...And I mean on the

Jacob struggles as Blackie pins one arm behind him.
OLD TIMER (CONT'D)
I'm tellin ya, ya can't red light
him, we don't need that trouble.
Look at them clothes - he's no bum.
Blackie scans Jacob's clothes, then tosses him inside the
train and returns to the card game. Jacob pants, relieved.
OLD TIMER (CONT'D)
Don't be sore kid. It's more like a
reflex with Blackie. I'm Camel..And

Jacob jumps out of the stock car, in awe of what he sees::
Hundreds of dirty, unshaven men pouring out of the train
like ants on candy. The wagons of the train are painted
scarlet red with gold trim and sunburst wheels. Emblazoned on
each wagon; BENZINI BROTHERS MOST SPECTACULAR SHOW ON EARTH.
Jacob wanders as the Circus is being created: Canvas tents
are raised, the Big Top laying sprawled on the ground. Men
standing over seams, lacing pieces together...Eight man
sledge teams pound stakes into the ground at breakneck
speed....Teams of men are raising enormous poles with their
combined weight, chanting: Pull it! Shake it! Break it!
Again!...Now down stake it!...Several teams horses pulling
wagons are charging right for Jacob..

THE ANIMALS.
Jacob is in awe. Camels, llamas, zebras and horses stand
behind low ropes slung between iron stakes, some with their
heads in mounds of hay.....Two giraffes stand within a chain-
link fence....lions, tigers, panthers, jaguars, bears, chimps
and an Orangutan.
The animals stop moving, as if to give Jacob an
acknowledgement. Jacob responds with a nod or a smile.
The Orangutan is stretching it's arm outside it's den for
something out of reach. Jacob tries to understand."|speech
117|JACOB|"What is it? What do you want?
The Orangutan strains its arm. Blinking at him. Pointing.
Jacob looks around and sees A HALF SQUASHED ORANGE on the
ground in front of the cage. He picks it up.
Jacob opens the den and hands the Orangutan the orange. She
takes it and sets it on the floor of her den. She returns and
reaches out for Jacob again.
14.
Jacob hesitates, not knowing what she wants. But deciding to
trust her, Jacob extends his hand to hers.
The Orangutan wraps her long fingers around Jacob's hand and
holds it for a beat, looking to his face. Jacob returns the
gaze, realizing she is thanking him. He is touched."|speech
118|JACOB (CONT'D)|"You're welcome, ma'am.
The Orangutan lets go and returns to the orange in her den.

hiding her routine boredom.

Behind the rows of beautiful black and white horses, Jacob
catches flashes of pink sequins...pink tights...pink sequined
gloves of a WOMAN caressing and whispering to them.
She is MARLENA. Her shimmering eyes and hair. Her porcelain
skin. Her pink sequins make her glisten and sparkle...
Jacob is spellbound as he watches Marlena's gift with horses;
Marlena uses signals with her whip or clicking sounds with
her tongue to communicate with the horses: they line up at
her subtle command, they raise their hooves, they bow down to
her, rise up on their hind legs...
She clicks her tongue and one White Silver Maned Horse lifts
a hoof for her to inspect. She clicks for him to take a step.
Jacob notices the Silver Maned Horse walks tenderly on the
foot. He decides to help....Approaching the shimmering
Marlena, Jacob looks like he's been shovelling shit all day."|speech

Marlena doesn't respond. She looks at him with suspicion."|speech

Marlena nods. Jacob also clicks his tongue as he glides his
hands up Silver Star's fetlock. To Marlena's surprise, the
horse trusts Jacob, lifting its hoof. Jacob examines it."|speech
148|JACOB (CONT'D)|"He should be all right for tonight.
But I'd put him on stall rest as
soon as possible.
He clicks his tongue and eases the hoof down. Marlena looks
both impressed and insulted. Jacob smiles. Marlena does not.
She clicks and assembles her horses in formation, then leads
them out of the menagerie....Jacob looks after her adoringly."|speech

with him?
Jacob hesitates before answering, then:"|speech
326|JACOB|"The connective tissues between the
hoof and the coffin bone are
compromised and the coffin bone
rotates toward the sole of the
hoof. If he keeps walking, it'll
puncture through...He's in a lot of
pain."|speech
327|MARLENA|And if he rests?|speech
328|JACOB|"You'll lose him anyway. I'm sorry.
Marlena breaths in this bad news and braces herself, tears
welling up in her eyes."|speech
329|MARLENA|"Then you have to put him down.
Jacob is impressed by her...and a little surprised."|speech
330|JACOB|It's the right thing to do.|speech
331|MARLENA|But August won't let you.|speech
332|JACOB|"(Beat. Then:)
If I'm the show's vet then it's my
decision, isn't it?"|speech
333|MARLENA|But August won't like it.|speech

Marlena is impressed by Jacob. And surprised. She doesn't
quite know what to make of him.

They laugh but Jacob insists boldly."|speech
340|JACOB|"I need a gun! Or a rifle! Now!
Grady leans inside the open car door and gets him a rifle.
Jacob takes it and marches back. They watch him, curiously.

Jacob respects Marlena's fortitude...Jacob raises the rifle
and aims, trembling...Stoic Marlena, tears in her eyes, turns
her face away...Jacob pauses, upset...then...shoots.
39.
Jacob's distraught expression tells us everything as the
rifle slides to his side. He looks to Marlena. This is their
first moment of intimacy. She rises and takes the rifle from
his grip. She sees his arm bruised from the cats. She seems
to know what it means. She offers a respectful farewell."|speech

Jacob sees Rex, lying on his side in his cage, panting with
thirst. He brings a bucket of water to Rex's cage and opens
it. Rex gets to his feet but this time Jacob doesn't flinch.
He isn't frightened. He gives Rex the bucket of water. Rex
drinks as Jacob strokes his mane, which Rex allows..."|speech
350|JACOB|"Friends now?
August calmly enters the menagerie with the rifle. He walks
to the center and stops, staring at Jacob.
Jacob goes about caring for the animals - moving from one to
the next - trying not to be unnerved by August's presence.
Then August does a surprising thing: He sits in the center of
the menagerie, crossed legged, with the rifle beside him."|speech
351|AUGUST|"You've got a gift for them. Like
Marlena with horses. It's God-
given. I can always spot it.

August tilts his head curiously, with a smile."|speech
355|AUGUST|"You're a genuine curiosity Jacob
Jankowski. What am I to do with
you? ... I threaten to throw you
off a moving train, feed you to my
lions and you go ahead and shoot my
star horse anyway. So I think -
Jacob's an educated man. For Jacob
to disobey me and shoot that horse,
that horse must have been in pretty
bad shape. Perhaps bad enough to
injure my Marlena during the show.
And so I think Jacob Jankowski
might be a valuable person to have
around."|speech
356|JACOB|"Tell Diamond Joe the animals need
more water when the humidity's this
bad if I don't see him before I go."|speech

been waiting for you.
Jacob doesn't know whether to believe him or not. Then:"|speech

again. I'll give you this one. I'll
call it ""respect""ù...Next one I call
""betrayal""ù. Understood?"|speech
359|(JACOB NODS)|"I do thank you though. You and
Silver Star solved a much bigger
problem for me.
August pulls a pack of Camels from his pocket."|speech
360|JACOB|"What problem?
August lights, inhales, blows smoke then:
41."|speech
361|AUGUST|"The cats. You see, meat eaters are
always more valuable to a circus
than hay burners. And you saw what
we had to feed them."|speech
362|JACOB|"What does Silver Star have to do
with the cats?"|speech
363|AUGUST|"We should have just enough food for
them to get us to the next show,

part the way to reveal:
ROSIE THE ELEPHANT: She is gargantuan. Ten feet tall at the
shoulder. Her skin is mottled and cracked from the tip of her
trunk down to her feet. Only her ears are smooth. She has
deeply set, amber eyes with extremely long lashes. She stands
tall behind a rope, chained to a stake in the ground.
Jacob, Marlena, August, Diamond Joe and Greg observe her."|speech

All right. See this animal...this

earth....Here's your bull hook.
You're gonna need it.

with a four inch metal pick coming off the end - to Jacob."|speech

she was the best bull you had.
ROSIE'S CARETAKER
If she was the best bull, why is
she the only one left? You think
you're the first show to turn up
picking on the bones?
August is annoyed. As the Caretaker gathers his things:
ROSIE'S CARETAKER (CONT'D)
Some elephant tramp who dropped
dead in Genesee sold her for a song
which still ain't no bargain cause
she ain't done a damn thing since
but eat everything in sight.

the sound and see that the two of them are alone in the tent.
All the workmen have left.
Jacob and Marlena turn back to Rosie who stands between them.
There is a awkward, lovely moment of intimacy between the
three as Marlena strokes Rosie's trunk. Her hand and Jacob's
come very close to overlapping. When their eyes meet, one of
them quickly averts their glance...There is clearly a growing
attraction between them. But it's uncomfortable."|speech

dramatic statement. August and Marlena look up to him.

front of a guest. Jacob downs his wine, closing his eyes.
Suddenly, August grabs Jacob and Marlena and pulls them up to
dance, throwing his arm around them both as we hear: Louis
Armstrong's DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME.
August starts singing along, imitating Satchmo's voice,
encouraging Jacob to join in...August is a great performer,

laugh along."|speech

Jacob joins in to perform with August. Marlena applauds them.
August breaks away to dance with Marlena as Jacob sings. They

Jacob gives up singing and plops himself on an upholstered
chair, drinking more champagne. Jacob watches them dance:

maybe love does that to a man. I
didn't know much about it.
Suddenly, August kisses Marlena - a bit too aggressively."|speech
459|MARLENA|Darling. Darling, please..|speech
460|(GIGGLES)|"Gently. We have a guest.
August stares at her. His expression darkens - locking his
eyes on Marlena and tilting his head as if he is examining
her. Marlena smiles and strokes his face. August doesn't
respond. He remains intense..."|speech
461|MARLENA (CONT'D)|"Darling, what is it?
August takes her face by the chin and tilts it with complete
control, as if searching for proof of something he can't
trust. His grip tightens, hurting her.
Alerted, Jacob sits up, prepared to intervene...But Marlena
shows no sign of fear. She knows exactly what to do."|speech
462|MARLENA (CONT'D)|"August, dear...
She manages to moves his hand to her mouth and kisses it."|speech
463|MARLENA (CONT'D)|"You don't know your own strength,
my love.
And then, just as quickly, August's expression softens,
relaxes, almost into sadness...as if he's about to
cry....Marlena senses it immediately. She whispers lovingly."|speech
464|MARLENA (CONT'D)|"Auggie?
August stops and eyes the bed beyond them. He leaves Marlena
and throws himself face first on the bed."|speech

awkwardly. August feels humiliated until:
The crowd laughs, thinking it's the act. They applaud.
August realizes the crowd loves it. So August, the performer,
starts to play the infuriated fool to the audience, acting
comically angry and frustrated with Rosie..
But when he turns back to Rosie, he is red-faced with real
anger, poking under her shoulders with the bull hook.

sharply into her shoulder blade...and Rosie takes off at a

Marlena lets go of the halter and leans hard to the left.

the pole above the entrance and is left hanging there as
Rosie exits the Big Top...
For a moment, the audience doesn't know if this is part of
the act. Jacob wants to run to help her...
But Marlena quickly decides what to do; She lets go of the
pole with her left hand and quickly swings around so she is
facing the audience, still hanging from the pole.
Her face lights up and she points to her toes. The Band
Leader takes this as a signal and conducts the band into a
drum roll. The crowd relaxes and applauds.
Marlena begins swinging, gaining momentum as the band roll
mounts. Soon, in one final burst of performance inspiration,
she releases herself from the pole, sails through the air
tucking her body into a ball, rolling twice, uncurling for
one sideways rotation and lands firmly in the sawdust in her
feet. She straightens up and thrusts her arms in the air.
The crowd goes wild. The Band plays victory music. Coins are
thrown from the bleachers. Even the Spec performers cheer.

their third bottle of champagne. Marlena is wearing a
beautiful, low cut beaded red gown. Jacob can barely keep his
eyes off of her.
Marlena is particularly drunk - we've never seen her this
wild or spontaneous. She sings along with the band...she
keeps rhythm by banging her hands on the table.

Rosie the command to lift Marlena down with her trunk.
But Rosie hesitates. August commands her again, with more
force. But Rosie doesn't move forward...she shuffles a foot
backwards. August grips his silver tipped cane. Oh-oh...

Jacob and other performers watch anxiously. Will Rosie fail?
Then August turns to the audience and mimes apologizing to
the crowd. When he back is turned, Rosie hits his butt with
her trunk. August freezes. The crowd laughs uproariously.
Jacob and the others realize it's all part of the act. Walter
slaps his back. Barbara kisses his cheek.
August displays great performance skills. He turns to Rosie
acting suspicious. Rosie lifts her head away, as if to say
""It wasn't me""ù.
August turns back to the crowd to apologize and once again,
Rosie flicks his behind with her trunk. This time August
knows it her. He turns to her, tips his hat over his brow and
shakes his finger, scolding, as if to say, ""No, no, no""ù
Rosie responds by waving her trunk, mocking him.
