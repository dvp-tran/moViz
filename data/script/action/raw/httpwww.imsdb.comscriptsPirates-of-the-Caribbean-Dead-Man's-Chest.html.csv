63|GIBBS|"And whatever this key unlocks, *inside*
there's something valuable. So, we're
setting out to find whatever this key
unlocks!"|speech
64|JACK SPARROW|"No! If we don't have the key, we can't
open whatever it is we don't have that
it unlocks. So what purpose would be
served in finding whatever need be unlocked,
which we don't have, without first having
found the key what unlocks it?"|speech
65|GIBBS|So - We're going after this key!|speech
66|JACK SPARROW|"You're not making any sense at all.
Any more questions?"|speech
67|MARTY|So... Do we have a heading?|speech

73|MARTY|"Have you noticed lately... The captain
seems to be actin' a bit strange...
-er."|speech

you know him?"|speech
81|LORD CUTLER BECKETT|"We've had dealings in the past.  And
we've each left our mark... on the other."|speech
82|WILL TURNER|What mark did he leave on you?|speech

England."|speech

the same as being free."|speech
89||"Freedom.  Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.
The world is shrinking, the blank pages"|location

his place in the new world or perish.
Not unlike you, Mister Turner. You and
your fiancée face the hangman's noose."|speech

Pearl."|speech
92|LORD CUTLER BECKETT|The Black Pearl?|speech
93|WILL TURNER|The property you want that he possesses.|speech
94|LORD CUTLER BECKETT|"A ship? Hardly. The item in question's
considerably smaller and far more valuable.

at all times. A compass.  Ah, you know
it. Bring back that Compass, or there's
no deal."|speech
