2||"ON A BLACK SCREEN: Credits.
A RAUCOUS VOICE (SWIMMER’S) CHANTING IN THE CHEROKEE LANGUAGE.
A RANGE OF MOUNTAINS SLOWLY EMERGES: shrouded in a blue mist
like a Chinese water color. Below them, close to a small
town, YOUNG MEN, armed with vicious sticks and stripped to
the waist, come charging in a muscular, steaming pack.
Their opponents, also swinging sticks, attach the pack.
A ball, barely round, made of leather, emerges, smacked
forwards by INMAN, who hurtles after it and collides with a
stick swung by SWIMMER, a young and lithe American Indian.
Inman falls, clutching his nose. The ball bobbles on the
ground in front of him. He grabs it and gets to his feet,
the blood pouring from his nose.
His team form a phalanx around him and he continues to charge.
A PRISTINE CABRIOLET pulled by an impressive horse, comes
down towards the town. It has to pass across the temporary
field of play, parting the teams. Some of the contestants
grab their shirts to restore propriety as the Cabriolet and
its two exotic passengers passes by.
The driver is a man in his early fifties, dressed in the
severe garb of a minister, MONROE. And next to him, a self-
conscious girl in the spotless elaborate, architectural skirts
of the period, is his daughter, ADA. Inman, using his shirt
to staunch his battered nose, looks at Ada, astonished by
her. An angel in this wild place.
Now Swimmer stops chanting and begins, more hesitantly, to
translate into English:"|stage direction

like a dog as you walk alone. You
will carry dog shit cupped in your
hands. You will be smeared with dog
shit. Your spirit will wane and
dwindle to blue, the colour of
despair..."|speech

various locals. Inamn watches them, on the other side of the
crowd. The Reverend Monroe, his daughter Ada. Up from
Charleston, bringing God's word to you heathens! Is Esco's
preferred introduction. Building a church. Inman watches
Ada, moves his head to keep her in view as Swimmer stitches,
and winces with pain."|stage direction

YEAR OF THE CIVIL WAR.
A STAND OF TREES. The pastoral lush green Virginia. A RABBIT
surfaces from its hole. Peace and beauty.
A second RABBIT shakes itself from the ground, darts into
open ground to confront the FORBIDDING TRENCHES OF THE
CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMIES, RANGED AGAINST EACH OTHER ON
THE OUTSKIRTS OF PETERSBURG. Massive wooden barricades in
the shape of crosses, rows of X's, define the two lines. The
Federals have been laying siege for months. So early and
it's already hot. The trees are an oasis of green in a world
of mud between the two stark and ugly scars of the trenches.
IN THE CONFEDERATE LINES, the men are rousing, boiling water
for coffee or to shave, smoking, stiff from night. There's a
large gun emplacement and some men still sleep against the
stub-nosed cannon. Another RABBIT is disturbed from its hole.
Ears pricked up to a distant rumbling."|stage direction

HE'S BEING LIFTED SLOWLY INTO THE AIR, the earth swelling.
AN APOCALYPTIC EXPLOSION. FOUR TONS OF DYNAMITE RIP THE GROUND
OPEN IN A CRATER 135 FEET LONG, 90 FEET ACROSS, 30 FEET DEEP.
HORSES, GUNS, MEN ARE BLOWN TO PIECES AND THROWN UP INTO THE
AIR.
INMAN DISAPPEARS UNDER DIRT AND DEBRIS.
Pandemonium. The Confederates are in complete disarray. The
Federals pour forwards across NO MANS LAND, through the
peaceful oasis of trees, roaring the roar of attack. They
flood towards the crater, hundreds of them, charging into a
dense and impenetrable WALL OF SMOKE.
THEN THEY'RE INSIDE THE GREAT GASH OF CRATER AND CAN'T GET
OUT AGAIN, arriving at an insurmountable wall of mud.
The Confederates regroup. Orders are yelled. Chaos developing
into battle.
The Confederates begin firing into the crater. Guns and mortar
wheel round and empty into what is becoming a terrible death
trap.
Inman gets to his feet. Oakley with him, and rushes through
the smoke to the pit, emptying his LeMats into the crater.
LATER: A BLACK REGIMENT from the Union join the attack. Bodies
falling on bodies as the Federals charge in and pack their
comrades even tighter. The Confederates make a pincer movement
outside the Crater, forcing all the Federals in. It's
Medieval.
No escape.
THE CONFEDERATES jump into the pit to engage the Federals.
Hand to hand fighting. Too close for rifles, just bayonets,
and guns swung like clubs and Inman sliding down into that
hell, tiring the nine rounds, then the shotgun charge, which
does a terrible damage. Primitive. Unutterable carnage. Men
killing each other in embraces, soldier crushed against
soldier, desperate to survive, to kill, to live. An oozing
layer cake of bodies, dead and frantically alive, drowning
in slick.
YOUNG OAKLEY loses his rifle and picks up a magazine case,
clubbing his opponent, then slips onto him and is stuck with
a bayonet, the pain of which makes him squeal.
INMAN GOES AT IT. He's a warrior, punching and stabbing and
firing. A coldly efficient killer. He's grabbed from behind
and crushed, a hand gouging at his face, an almighty struggle.
He falls and lands on top of Oakley, and he and his Federal
opponent fight to the death with the wounded boy as their
pillow. The slaughter continues over and around them, the
sound, the sound of hell and madness. The boy has his arm
around Inman, like lovers.
LATER: The Confederates run after the retreating Union
soldiers, firing, cavalry riding them down. Inman stands,
the boy's blood all over him, exhausted and appalled. The
crater, behind him, an abattoir of men. The victors are
yelling, pumped mad with adrenaline. Butcher comes alongside
Inman."|stage direction

Butcher runs over, but can't find a charge for his musket.
He looks around in the stack of corpses, pulling out weapons,
tries one: not loaded, throws it down, tries another: not
loaded. The wounded man can't get up, tries to drag himself
like a crab away from Butcher. Inman yells at him, appalled."|stage direction

A great deal of casual looting. Of boots, of equipment, of
personal items. Inman sees a soldier in the crater, lining
up wounded Federals, putting their heads in a row. THE MAN
EXTRACTS A HAMMER FROM HIS BELT AND, SATISFIED HE HAS AN
ECONOMIC ARRANGEMENT, PROCEEDS DOWN THE LINE, SMASHING EACH
SKULL.
Inman turns away, sees another Rebel, extravagantly costumed,
a strange FIDDLE head protruding from his knapsack. This is
STOBROD THEWES. He's bent over a dead Federal, examining his
mouth. He reaches behind his back and roots around in the
knapsack, producing A PAIR OF PLIERS, WHICH HE INSERTS INTO
THE CORPSE'S MOUTH. He's yanking away when A SWINGING BOOT
connects with his head and knocks him to the ground.
Startled, he looks up to see Inman hovering over him."|stage direction

85||"A beautiful night. Lots of stars. Inman and three others,
including Butcher, slide over the top of the trench, far to
one side of the stand of trees. The plan is to cast a wide
arc that will bring them around back of the trees, closer to
the enemy side than their own. The four men slither over the
ground. They pause. Inman has arrived at a tangle of corpses.
He slithers over them.
They work their way towards the trees. THERE ARE A HALF DOZEN
FEDERALS CROUCHING IN THE COVER OF THE TREES. They are dozing.
Only one of them sits with a rifle surveying the Confederate
lines, the others have their backs to the enemy, sitting
against the trunks, grabbing a few minute's sleep.
As the four rebels approach, still crawling, one of the
Federals opens his eyes, sees the attack, shifts for his
rifle. INMAN IMMEDIATELY STANDS UP, FIRING INSTANTLY, killing
him and two others, while Butcher throws himself at another.
The exchanges are brief and savage and one of Inman's party
and all of the Federals lay dead. Then the rebels break from
the trees.
A FLARE goes up, then another, both from the Confederate
trenches. INMAN AND HIS ACCOMPLICES ARE PICKED OUT IN A
BRILLIANT GREEN LIGHT. Shots follow, from both sides, aimed
at the three returning men as they zigzag towards their own
lines. As they get close, voices cry out, rippling down the
trench, joining their own admonitions: Don't shoot, Hold
your fire, they're our boys, Hold your fire!!! They're almost
home. Butcher is laughing, whooping. Then just as suddenly
he falls, wounded. Inman stops, turns back, runs to him.
Inman collects Butcher, drags him, carries him. They're fifty
yards from their lines. A BULLET CATCHES INMAN IN THE NECK.
He goes down like a tree, blood pouring from his neck. Lying
on the ground, he watches the phosphorescent lights slowly
fade to black, all sound fading with them."|stage direction

now it begins to curve left, forcing him -- against his
judgment, to circle back. He approaches A SMALL JETTY.
A sign: Ferry $5. Yell Loud.
On the far bank there's A CABIN ON STILTS above the highwater
mark. Inman calls out, reluctantly, his voice still a kind
of growl. Then again.
A TINY FIGURE steps out of the cabin and waves before jumping
into a small canoe. The canoe heads against the current, the
rower's back bent with the effort. As the canoe approaches,
Inman sees that the ferryman is, in fact, A YOUNG GIRL, not
eighteen. She doesn't look at him. He produces five dollars.

waterlevel. Water pours into the canoe. Dogs bark, and now
FIGURES are visible at the jetty. HOME GUARD. One of them
has a sniper's rifle and is loading for a third shot. Inman
can see him sighting the rifle. They lie flat in the canoe.

the canoe CATCHES INMAN A BLOW TO HIS HEAD and he sinks.
Veasey hauls him to the surface and, surprisingly strong,
holds him with one fist, the boat with the other, lets the
current take them, pulling them under, then up, under, then
up, but clinging on, as the rifle continues to deliver its
assault, another shot into the boat, another into the water

puts Ethan back in his crib, comes outside.

of the spine to make two sides of meat. Now Sara is holding
up a sheet of hog fat, as if it were a lace shawl. Now she's
rendering the fat into lard. Now Inman's salting the two
hams. Now Sara's washing the intestine. She sings all the
while -- I dreamed that my bower was full of red swine and
my bride bed full of blood -- they don't really converse.
Inman continues to work.
Sara goes back inside to Ethan's crib. Inman glances back,
but can hardly bear to, her anxiety so palpable. THE BABY IS
DEAD. She looks at it. She takes it up in her arms. Kisses
its forehead.
Makes a strange stifling noise. Inman doesn't look at her.
She comes out again, shovels some of the food into a plate,
serves it up to Inman, gently touching him as she does so.
