his feet as the voices get louder.
DIFFERENT ANGLE.
The crowd is moving toward him. A woman walks in front of a
group of young men who circle around her, taunting and
harassing her. A moment later David can make out the face:
BETTY clutches her handbag to her chest while the crowd
circles her like a pack of dogs.
CLOSER. BETTY.
The ROSY HUE of her face stands out in stark relief to the
black and white faces around her. Betty holds her head high
with dignity (and fear) while the ugly epithets overlap one
another ""Oooh--let's see the rest of you ... Let's see what's
under that nice blue dress ... Bet she's even pinker than her
picture ..."" One of the boys yanks at Betty's skirt and she
quickens her pace. Just at that moment the boy is shoved to
the ground ...
WIDER.
David shields his ""mother"" as he shoves one of the boys into
the dirt. The kid gets up but David punches him hard in the
side of the jaw and the rest of them just stare. (Violence is
as new as anything else and it seems to freeze the moment.)
