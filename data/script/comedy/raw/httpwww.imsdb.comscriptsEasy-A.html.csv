Penderghast, being of sound mind,
ample breast size and the
occasional corny knock knock joke,
do enter this video blog into
evidence in the case against me.
Because I'm being judged by a jury
of my peers, I will attempt to
insert `like' and `totally' into my
confession as much as possible. So
here it goes... I confess I'm, in
no small part, to blame for the
vociferous gossip that has turned
my Varsity letter scarlet, but -
for anyone hoping that the sizzling
details of my sordid past will
provide you with a reason to lock
the door and make love to a dollop
of your sister's moisturizing
lotion - you'll be gravely
disappointed.

Look, I just need to set the record
straight and what better way to do
