1   INT. CARGO PLANE. MILITARY AIRBASE. ISRAEL - DAY              1
A strange ROARING sound...
CLOSE ON A YOUNG WOMAN
...in darkness. Light begins to spill on her from the right
- revealing her face, lost in thought. This is RACHEL
SINGER - pretty, painfully young looking. A surgical
dressing covers half her face.
As we pull back a little we see that two YOUNG MEN sit
either side of her. They are STEPHAN GOLD (thirties) thick-
set, capable, and DAVID PERETZ (late twenties), dark-haired
and pale-faced.
The three faces in the darkness, each looking straight
ahead - something from a Caravaggio painting.
The roaring, which we realise is the sound of ENGINES,
gradually runs down into silence.
The light from the bay door which is opening off-screen
begins to flood the scene with HARSH DAYLIGHT, revealing
the inside of a CARGO PLANE.
Stephan turns to look at the growing light. Then he turns
to Rachel.
STEPHAN
Breathe.
He stands. Rachel turns to look at David but he is standing
too, his face a mask.
Rachel gathers herself, then stands and turns to follow the
other two, walking towards the light.
As the three approach the opening and descend the ramp of
the bay door, we hear a woman's voice:
SARAH (V.O)
We should never forget how young
they were."|unknown

SARAH (V.O.)(CONT'D)
My father, Stephan Gold, was the
youngest Unit Commander in
Mossad.
David is next...
SARAH (V.O.)(CONT'D)
David Peretz had his twenty-ninth
birthday while on the mission.
Then Rachel.
SARAH (V.O.)(CONT'D)
My mother was even younger. Only
twenty-five.
RACHEL'S P.O.V
Silhouetted against the bright light is a group of waiting
MILITARY and MOSSAD DIGNITARIES. Their hands are raised in
applause.
SARAH (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Despite their youth they'd had
the courage to confront an
unimaginable evil....
The three walk towards their welcoming party. Rachel blinks
against the sunlight, takes out a pair of sunglasses and
slips them on.

CLOSE ON OLDER RACHEL
...now 56. Handsome, impeccably groomed. A long crooked
SCAR runs down one side of her face.
SARAH (O.S)
...a man whose sadistic
experiments left thousands
disfigured or dead, who became
known by a name which defiles the
annals of medicine: The Surgeon
of Birkenau.
She's wearing tinted glasses, staring at us, listening to
Sarah speak.

Rachel's daughter - SARAH - stands at a podium, reading the
Dedication to a rather large audience who have come for the
launch of her first book.
She's 31, and clearly her mother's daughter.
The cover image from the book is projected on a screen
behind Sarah - a black and white photograph of a young
Rachel, David and Stephan. Above their faces, the title -
In Our Hands.
SARAH
Their mission had been to return
him to Israel to stand trial.
Instead it ended with his death
on the streets of East Berlin...

CLOSE ON YOUNG RACHEL
...as she waits behind David and Stephan, face bleached out
by the sunlight. She stares at the ground.
SARAH (V.O.)
But this was not what was
celebrated. It was their youth
itself that became a symbol. Here
were the children who had faced
Israel's greatest nightmare, her
greatest pain...
David and Stephan have moved out of shot and Rachel reaches
the DIGNITARIES. Still looking down, she manages a smile, a
bob of her head, reaches out to shake the first hand...

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    4.
SARAH (O.S.) (CONT'D)
This book is dedicated to my
inspiration. My mother, Rachel
Singer.
People around Rachel begin to applaud, the sound almost
startling her. Automatically she gives the same bob of the
head, acknowledging the applause.
Sarah, cheeks burning with a mixture of embarrassment and
emotion, hasn't finished yet. She locks eyes with her
mother.
SARAH (CONT'D)
Mother, I'm so very proud to be
your daughter.
More applause. Rachel manages to smile.
6   INT. FUNCTION ROOM. HOTEL NEAR TEL AVIV - LATER               6
The room is now alive with the excited chatter of the
guests.
Rachel moves against the tide of the audience with a fixed
social smile, murmuring thanks to well-wishers, trying to
get out, trying not to look like she's trying to get out...
7   EXT. TEL AVIV. HOTEL NEAR TEL AVIV. PATIO - CONTINUOUS        7
She emerges onto the empty patio, slides the glass door
shut behind her, muffling the chatter from the room beyond.
She lights a cigarette, inhales greedily, trying to calm
down. She stares at the sun blazing over the Mediterranean
ahead of her. Her glasses darken against the reflected
glare.
As if sensing something she turns to see a SMALL BOY - her
GRANDSON - watching her from behind the glass of the patio
door, something UNNERVING in his direct gaze.
Rachel stares back at him in silence.
Sarah appears behind the boy, her son, and scoops him up
into a hug. Still the boy stares at his grandmother, who
gives a tight smile and turns back to the sea.
Another guest walks up to Sarah and she nods, smiling, at
what he is saying to her but her eyes slide back to her
mother, standing on the other side of the glass.

8   1NT/EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK. TEL AVIV SUBURB - DAY               8
A shabby, dimly-lit stairwell in a run-down section of the
city.
A YOUNG MOSSAD AGENT knocks at one of the apartment doors.
After a moment it is answered by OLDER DAVID, now 62.
YOUNG AGENT
David Peretz?
DAVID
Yes.
YOUNG AGENT
You were expecting me?
David looks at this young version of himself.
DAVID
Yes. I was expecting you.
YOUNG AGENT
Would you come with me sir?
David stares at him, then walks back into the apartment.
The door almost swings shut and the Agent catches it,
considering walking in after him. But before he can, David
re-emerges carrying his jacket.
DAVID
Let's go.
TITLES BEGIN -
We TRACK with David, CLOSE on his face as the two men begin
the long walk down the staircase.
He doesn't say anything to his companion, doesn't look
around him, and we HOLD on that face as his mind tries to
catch up, tries to work something out, to decide...
9   EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS                                      9
The apartment block stands on stilts. Abandoned furniture
is piled around the columns supporting the building.
Still on David as the two men walk out from the darkness
into the street that services the run-down estate. David
follows as the agent moves ahead towards a larger road.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   6.
They cross a busy carriageway, and wait for a moment on the
central reservation for a break in the traffic.
Parked on the far side of the road, two identical cars,
their windows tinted.
The Agent moves to the leading car, opens the driver's door
and gets in. David stops in the road, opens the rear
passenger door and throws his jacket inside.
He pauses for a moment and turns to look back at the second
car.
10   INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS                                        10
A MAN sits in the back of the car, silhouetted against the
brightness outside. This is OLDER Stephan, now 63.
He watches as David straightens up, hands on hips,
squinting up at the sun.
11   EXT. STREET. TEL AVIV SUBURB - CONTINUOUS                    11
DAVID
(Indistinctly)
Sorry.
The Agent turns.
YOUNG AGENT
What, sir?
DAVID
(Beat)
I - I think I...
He stands like that for a moment and then suddenly STEPS
OUT INTO THE ROAD in front of an on-coming TRUCK. The
impact sweeps him out of the frame.
The shocked Agent scrambles out of the vehicle as other
cars screech to a halt in front of David's lifeless body.
TITLES END.
12   EXT. TERRACE. HOTEL NEAR TEL AVIV - NIGHT                    12
A celebratory dinner for the book launch is in progress -
publishers, journalists, local dignitaries...
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   7.
Rachel is re-joining the table, taking her place beside her
daughter amidst the dinner party chatter. Sarah watches
her.
SARAH
When are you going to stop?
RACHEL
Stop what?
SARAH
The smoking.
RACHEL
Soon.
SARAH
I hope so. Do it for your
grandson.
SARAH
Are you sure you have to go back
home tomorrow?
RACHEL
It's all arranged, I'm afraid...
SARAH
But we'll have breakfast before
you go? I thought maybe we could
take a walk on the beach? (Trying
to sound casual) I'd like you to
see more of him.
A WAITER leans over with WINE for Rachel. She covers her
glass.
RACHEL
(To Sarah, ill-at-ease)
Well, I'll be back. We
can...maybe in the holidays or...
MIRIAM, a PUBLISHER appears at her shoulder with a copy of
Sarah's book.
MIRIAM
I've marked the place. I thought
perhaps from chapter eleven...?
RACHEL
...Yes, thank you.
Rachel nods absently, flicking through the pages of the
book. Sarah realizes, with a small stab of pain, that she
has no idea what that means.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   8.
SARAH
If you'd rather read something
else, mother.....
RACHEL
No, that's fine.
Rachel is barely listening. She is staring at a black and
white photograph in the book.
We see that the photograph is of a YOUNG MAN in NAZI
UNIFORM. It's titled: DIETER VOGEL, ""The Surgeon of
Birkenau.""
MIRIAM
You must be very proud.
Rachel looks up at her, realizes what Miriam is talking
about.
RACHEL
(A little automatic)
...It's a wonderful achievement.
I'm very proud of her.
MIRIAM
And I'm sure you were invaluable
in the research.
SARAH
(Keeping it light)
Actually, my mother withstood all
interrogation. My father was the
talker. (Trying a joke) I'm the
only journalist in Israel she
won't speak to.
Miriam laughs obligingly but Sarah instantly regrets the
remark.
There is a sudden excited MURMUR from the table. The women
look over to where Stephan approaches the table. He is in a
motorised WHEELCHAIR. The Mossad Agent attends discreetly
in the background.
Rachel's face hardens.
RACHEL
I thought he couldn't come.
SARAH
(Standing up, surprised)
So did I.
Several of the local POLITICOS have stood up to greet
Stephan, who is all smiles and handshakes.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   9.
STEPHAN
(To the politicos)
Please, sit, sit. My God, it must
be election season.
There's good-natured laughter from the table. Sarah joins
her father, kissing his cheek.
SARAH
You came.
STEPHAN
I came. So you're the famous
author I've heard so much about?
Rachel watches as he takes a place at the table, picks up a
copy of the book and examines the cover photograph, holding
his glasses a little from his eyes to focus.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
(Without looking)
Rachel.
RACHEL
Stephan.
STEPHAN
(To Sarah)
Now you're the expert, maybe you
could tell me something.
(Pointing to himself) Who's this
handsome devil on the cover?
More polite laughter from the table.
STEPHAN (CONT'D)
It went well?
SARAH'S HUSBAND
She was wonderful.
STEPHAN
That's good. Good, good. That's
very good.
Rachel takes a sip of water and notices Stephen's hands,
crumbling some bread - they're SHAKING.
She looks up at his face, reads the hidden STRAIN there.
He senses her gaze and meets it, and for a second his smile
falters and SOMETHING LIKE PANIC flickers in his eyes.
Rachel stares back at him, disturbed. Miriam stands,
tapping her glass with her fork.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   10.
MIRIAM
I just want thank you all for
coming to help us celebrate the
launch of this wonderful book.
I'm sure we're all particularly
thrilled to have two of the
heroes of this story at the
table. And even more thrilled
that one of them has agreed to
read for us..."|unknown

rainwater which is dripping through various points in the
ceiling.
As she positions the last pot we REVOLVE around her to get
our first view of the far wall. And there, tied to a
radiator, is DIETER VOGEL, now 50. He's bound, his mouth
taped, apparently asleep.
Rachel doesn't, of course, react to this sight. Instead
she begins to clear away some pieces of BROKEN GLASS BOWL
from the floor. We TRACK with her as she walks back down
the short hallway into the kitchen, drops the pieces of
bowl into the bin. From the living room comes the three
distinct PINGS of rainwater dripping in the pots."|location

She stops suddenly, puzzled. It's a moment before she works
out what she's noticed - something has changed in the sound
of the rainwater next door.
There are only two drips instead of three.
She walks back towards the living room...
RACHEL'S P.O.V - through the living room door we can see
that one of the pots has been overturned. Rachel slows to a
stop. A sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn
but...it's too late. Vogel steps out of the alcove he's
been standing in so that he is directly in front of her.
Before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open
with a SHARD OF GLASS.
Instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face. Vogel
grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her, tries to
worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her
throat with the glass.
Her training kicking in, Rachel uses a krav magah move to
grab and twist Vogel's forearm, breaking his hold on her
and turning the arm until, with a yell of pain, Vogel drops
the shard. He swings wildly at her, but Rachel ducks the
fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face.
Vogel stumbles back, surprised by her speed and the sudden
pain of the blow.
Rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by
blood from her wound washing into her eyes.
As she wipes her eyes clear, Vogel grabs a LAMP from a
small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her
face. She falls.
Vogel begins to run, but, driven by adrenaline and
desperation, Rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at
him, catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards
the front door.
Vogel stumbles, manages to pull a leg free and stamps down
on Rachel who lets go with a moan. He stamps again, steps
free and kicks her hard in the head.
Rachel rolls with the force of the kick and comes to a
rest, losing consciousness.
RACHEL'S P.O.V - LOW ANGLE - Fluttering in and out of
darkness - Vogel's feet as he stands beside us, breathing
hard. Then he turns and hurries to the front door...and
out.

thinking only of how to avoid
being flogged, or kicked, or
killed. Only thinking of
themselves.
David looks up at him with a strange, crooked smile, eyes
glittering.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
Why do you think it only took
four soldiers to lead a thousand
people to the gas chambers?
Entire families? Because not one,
out of thousands, had the courage
to resist, the courage to be the
first to fall. Not one would
sacrifice himself. Even when we
took their children from them. I
knew then that you people had no
right to live, no right to...
He may have begun his speech hoping to get a reaction from
David but he has lost himself in his rant and so rather
than triumph we see only a moment of startled fear in his
eyes as David suddenly swings the bowl violently at his
head, SHATTERING IT on the pipe to which he is tied.
He grabs Vogel by the collar and begins to punch him, hard,
again and again.
Vogel slides sideways, limp. And still David punches him in
a murderous rage, possessed, wanting to break his skull
open, to kill him.
Rachel and Stephan run in, with Rachel reaching him first.
She throws her arms around him, trying to stop him, but -
instinctively - he throws a punch behind him. It connects,
splitting her lip and sending her flying to the ground.
Stephan runs at him, knocking him to the floor, and remains
lying on him, the two of them breathing hard, the assault

...as she finishes with the pots and notices the pieces of
shattered bowl scattered around Vogel. She kneels down in
front of him and collects up the pieces. She glances up at
Vogel, checking him. He is still slumped, eyes closed.
We TRACK with her as she walks back into the kitchen. From
the living room comes the three distinct PINGS of rainwater
dripping in the pots.
She drops the pieces of bowl into the bin and stops,
puzzled. It's a moment before she works out what she's
noticed - something has changed in the sound of the
rainwater next door. There only two drips instead of three.
She walks back towards the living room...
RACHEL'S P.O.V - through the living room door we can see
that one of the pots has been overturned. Rachel slows to a
stop. A sudden wave of adrenalin causes her to turn
but...it's too late. Vogel steps out of the alcove he's
been standing in so that he is directly in front of her.
Before she can even cry out he has slashed her face open
with a SHARD OF GLASS.
Instinctively she cups her hands to her ripped face. Vogel
grabs her by the hair and stepping behind her, tries to
worm his other hand underneath her raised arms to reach her
throat with the glass.
Her training kicking in, Rachel uses a krav magah move to
grab and twist Vogel's forearm, breaking his hold on her
and turning the arm until, with a yell of pain, Vogel drops
the shard. He swings wildly at her, but Rachel ducks the
fist and drives the palm of her hand up into his face.
Vogel stumbles back, surprised by her speed and the sudden
pain of the blow.
Rachel is about to press home the attack but is blinded by
blood from her wound washing into her eyes.
As she wipes her eyes clear, Vogel grabs a LAMP from a
small chest of drawers in the hall and smashes it into her
face. She falls.
Vogel begins to run, but, driven by adrenaline and
desperation, Rachel scrambles onto all fours and lunges at
him, catching hold of his trouser leg as he moves towards
the front door.
Vogel stumbles, manages to pull a leg free and stamps down
on Rachel who lets go with a moan. He stamps again, steps
free and kicks her hard in the head."|unknown

handbag and opens it. Inside is a pen. She lifts this and
the false bottom of the case away to reveal a HYPODERMIC
NEEDLE and an AMPULE of a clear liquid. With trembling

hesitates for a moment, her eyes adjusting to the gloom.
A MAN sits in a chair, angled towards the window, his back
to us. An IV drip hangs on a stand, its tube running into a
cannula on the back of a withered hand which hangs from the
chair.
The only sound is the faint, rasping breath of the man.
Rachel moves a little closer. On the bottom of the bed
hangs a medical chart. The name reads Ivan Schevchuk.

from her pocket.

directly into the tube - and it will be over. She holds the

Rachel comes through double doors and finds herself in a
long REC ROOM - PATIENTS and some STAFF grouped around the
room.
Rachel begins to walk through the room - elderly men all
around her, playing cards, reading, some sitting staring
vacantly.
She walks through them, staring at faces. Is he here? Is he
amongst this ordinary world?
She feels her pace quicken as she's drawn on through the
room. It's as if she's back at that terrible night. Vogel's
ahead of her somewhere, escaping all over again.
She FLASHES through DOUBLE DOORS into a junction area - a
long, empty corridor leading away from her on the right,
ahead another set of double doors...
She bursts through these doors and finds herself in...

A long, white tiled corridor of a room. A row of windows
down the right, under which sit WASHBASINS. There's a row
of LOCKERS and DOORS along the left.
Rachel walks on, feeling increasingly as if she's in a
dream.
She's deep into the room before she realises it's a dead-
end - there's no exit ahead of her.
VOGEL
(a dull rasp)
Why did you come...?
She turns and freezes.
Vogel has emerged from one of the doorways on the left. Now
he's between her and the doors on the far side of the room.
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   113.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
Why did you have to come? You
didn't have to follow me.
He begins to advance slowly towards her.
VOGEL (CONT'D)
Was it Schevchuk? Did he talk?
Rachel stands frozen as he creeps closer. He reaches out a
hand as if to reassure her, a ghastly attempt at
reasonableness.
VOGEL
I can stop him. I won't tell him
anymore. (Almost pleading) Nobody
needs to know.
As if the spell has broken Rachel makes a sudden dart for
the doors. But before she can pass him, Vogel has moved
with surprising speed and, almost before Rachel has seen
the SCISSORS in his other hand, he has stabbed them into
her shoulder.
She reels over against the opposite wall, dislodging a
GLASS SHELF which shatters into a WASHBASIN behind her.
Vogel goes after her, pinning her against the basin, one
hand on her throat, the other hand trying to stab her
again. Rachel manages to grab the scissor hand and the two
struggle frantically.
The scissors inch closer to her FACE, to her EYE.
Her other hand emerges from the basin behind her holding a
piece of the broken glass shelf, which she whips across
Vogel's face.
He gives a horrible shriek and lets her go, clutching at
his cheek.
Rachel collapses gasping to the floor.
Moaning, Vogel stumbles to a basin, blood dripping down
onto the white porcelain from his slashed face.
He suddenly notices Rachel has made it to her knees and is
trying to crawl towards the door,
He walks after her, pulls back her head, gets ready to stab
the scissors into her throat.

830||"Then he gives a gasp of pain, eyes closed, his whole body
doubling with the pain, hands weakly scrabbling at the
PIECE OF GLASS Rachel has stabbed into his thigh.
He falls, almost on top of Rachel, and she finds herself
pressed against his contorted face as he hisses and spits
in agony.
His hand searches blindly for the dropped scissors.
Rachel grapples with him, almost embracing him, apparently
trying to prevent him for reaching it.
His searching hand locates the scissors and his eyes open
in triumph, staring straight into Rachel's. He raises the
scissors above his head.
Then he stabs Rachel in the stomach.
Rachel jack-knifes, as if she's been punched.
Then...nothing. Both lie still. The only sound is Vogel's
rasping breathing.
Slowly Vogel gathers himself, drops the scissors, gets onto
his knees - the victor.
He climbs to his feet and begins to limp towards the door.

make it back to his room, back to safety.
Suddenly he staggers against the wall.
Something's wrong, something in his back. He twists around
trying to locate the source of the strange sensation. And
there it is - the HYPODERMIC NEEDLE Rachel has stuck
between his shoulders.
He touches it with his fingertips, eyes wide with horror,
feeling the rush of lethal chemicals through his blood. He
twists again trying to pull the needle free but his legs
are already giving way and he collapses to the floor.
Moments later he's dead.

He's evidently finished his fruitless interview with

turns, about to leave, when he suddenly notices a NOTE upon
