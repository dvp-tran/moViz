satellite dish, stringing wire, trying to get it to work.
(We get glimpses of him throughout the scene as he
struggles with what is assuredly a pirate operation.)
Four of six floodlights nailed to the roof cast pools of
yellow into the gathering darkness. ROY ""TIN CUP"" McAVOY
stands under the swarm of moths crowding the brightest
light, hitting golf balls. THWOCK...! Launching them,
really, into the deepening night. There's a beer between
his legs. Behind him:
A group of men forms a semicircle, facing away from Tin
Cup. These men are the range regulars: CURT, CLINT,
EARL, and DEWEY. Each man has money in one hand and his
preferred libation in the other. They're all looking
back and forth between the bug lights hung on the back
wall, and muttering what sounds like bets to:
ROMEO POSAR -- a smaller man, he stands at the center of
the group with a handful of cash. Romeo is a part-time
bookie and full-time driving range man. Born across the
river in Mexico, Romeo is Tin Cup's caddie, confidante,
best friend.

until... ZAP! A BUG is ELECTROCUTED. And Dewey cheers
triumphantly while the other regulars mutter curses about
how they woulda, coulda, shoulda bet.

beauty in her early thirties, and she's got all new
everything the sport of golf requires: new bag, new
clubs, new shoes, new clothes, new visor... she looks
like she stepped out of an ad in Golf Digest. And all
the men are asking themselves the same question: what's
she doing here? The silence invites Molly to supply the
riddle's answer.
MOLLY
The doctor is the son's mother.
Feminists pose the riddle to
reveal how deeply our sexual
stereotypes run.
(directly to Tin Cup)
I take it you're a feminist?
Tin Cup misses the ball he's been bouncing, breaking the
spell. The regulars wait for Tin Cup's response.
TIN CUP
Ma'am, I've been called a lot of
things -- but no one's ever
saddled me with that one.
MOLLY
You might try being saddled
sometime -- the smell of leather,
the sting of a whip...

46||"The lesson begins. Tin Cup can be slightly condescending
in these situations, though she's got him a little wary.
TIN CUP
The first thing you gotta learn
about this game, Doc, is it ain't
about hitting a little white ball
into some yonder hole. It's about
inner demons and self-doubt and
human frailty and overcoming all
that crap. So... what kinda
doctor'd you say you were?
MOLLY
I'm a psychologist -- in layman's
terms call me a neo-Jungian, post-
modern Freudian, holistic
secularist.
TIN CUP
Damn.
She begins unpacking one of her bags, pulling out every
golf gimmick on the market -- swing aid straps to pull
your elbows together, a ball pendulum that hangs from
your hat, a metal contraption for your feet, etc.
MOLLY
Inner demons and human frailty are
my life's work. I used to
practice in El Paso but I've moved
