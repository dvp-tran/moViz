1   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- MORNING
Day breaks. Hassan (50) arrives at a solitary house made of
adobe, in the southern deserts of Morocco, carrying a satchel
and a large bundle wrapped in cloth.
He walks past a corral made out of branches, where several
goats bleat, and knocks on the front door.
2   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
Abdullah (40), opens.
HASSAN
(In Arabic)
Good morning Abdullah... I brought
you this...
He holds up the bundle.
3   INT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
Abdullah's family is inside the house. There is a room, a
small table and a simple kitchen. Yasira (38) is roasting
some goat meat assisted by Yamil (16) and Zora (17), her
daughters.
Abdullah and his sons, Yussef (13) and Ahmed (14), are sitting
on the floor around the small table, looking at a well-
conserved .270 caliber Winchester 60 rifle.
HASSAN
(To Abdullah)
It's almost new.
He takes out several boxes of cartridges from his satchel.
HASSAN (CONT'D)
Three hundred cartridges...
He opens a box and shows them one of the golden bullets.
HASSAN (CONT'D)
The hunter who gave it to me said
you can hit up to three kilometers
away.
ABDULLAH
How much do you want for everything?
HASSAN
One thousand dirhams.
2.
ABDULLAH
One thousand dirhams? I'll give you
one thousand and a goat.
Abdullah and Hassan exchange a look and Hassan smiles.
4   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- DAY
Hassan and Abdullah's family are behind the house. Hassan
stands with the rifle in front of a rock some twenty yards
away and he turns toward Abdullah.
HASSAN
With this rifle, your sons will be
able to kill plenty of jackals.
He aims at the rock and pulls the trigger without holding
the rifle properly. It is clear that he doesn't know how to
fire a weapon, and the shot cracks loudly. The rifle kicks
and hits him roughly in the shoulder. The bullet flies far
wide of the rock. The women laugh nervously.
Rubbing his shoulder, Hassan turns to Abdullah.
HASSAN (CONT'D)
Let one of your sons shoot.
Abdullah looks at his boys and points at the younger one.
ABDULLAH
Let Yussef shoot.
When Hassan is about to hand Yussef the rifle, Ahmed cuts
him off, upset.
AHMED
I want to shoot first.
Father and son exchange an angry glance. Hassan, without
realizing it, turns and gives the rifle to Ahmed. The boy
grabs the gun: it is heavier than he thought.
HASSAN
Look, load it like this.
Hassan opens the chamber, inserts the bullet and then closes
it. Once it is loaded, he points at the safety.
HASSAN (CONT'D)
This is the safety. Push it in when
you're ready.
Ahmed nods. Unsure of himself, he raises the rifle and,
almost without aiming, fires. The shot kicks up dust far
from the rock. His sisters laugh.
3.
HASSAN (CONT'D)
If he doesn't hit the jackals, at
least he'll scare the shit out of
them.
Ahmed lowers the rifle. His father grabs it and gives it to
Yussef enthusiastically."|unknown||
1||"Your turn.
Yussef grabs the rifle and loads it confidently. He lifts
the rifle with ease and takes his time aiming. He seems
innately skilled at the maneuver. He shoots and the bullet
hits just below the rock.
Abdullah celebrates the shot and mockingly turns to Hassan.
ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
Now this kid shoots a hell of a lot
better than you.
5   EXT. GOAT CORRAL -- LATER
Yussef takes one of the goats out, ties and ropes it and
gives it to Hassan. Abdullah supervises. Yasira approaches
and gives Abdullah a bag."|unknown||
2||"Your lunch.
Abdullah takes it and turns to his sons.
ABDULLAH
You better kill at least three
jackals.
HASSAN
And make sure no one sees you with
the rifle, hide it if you see someone
approach you.
Ahmed nods.   Abdullah and Hassan go on their way.
6   EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- LATER
Yasira and Yamil are far from the house, cleaning some
goatskins stretched out on some branches.
Ahmed, with the rifle in his hands, opens the corral gate
and enters to herd them out. He calls his brother.
AHMED
Yussef, Yussef...

spying."|location||

Yussef..."|unknown||

10||"AHMED
What are you doing?"|unknown||
11||Yussef turns around and signals for him to lower his voice.|location||
12||"AHMED (CONT'D)
I told you not to spy on her again."|unknown||
13||"Yussef pays no attention and keeps spying. Ahmed pulls him
by the shoulder and makes him lose his balance. Yussef falls
on his ass."|location||
14||"AHMED (CONT'D)
I said don't spy on her."|unknown||
15||Yussef gets up and dusts himself off.|location||

19||"The goats graze. Yussef and Ahmed watch them sitting on the
side of a hill. They look hot and bored. They both throw
stones at a small rusty can. Yussef throws one and misses.
Ahmed throws his and does. He draws a line in the ground."|location||
20||"AHMED
Five to two."|unknown||
21||A jackal is stalking the goats.    Yussef spots it.|location||
22||"5.
YUSSEF
There's a jackal over there."|unknown||
23||"Ahmed raises his head but cannot see it. Yussef points at
it, but Ahmed still cannot locate it. Yussef despairs."|location||
24||"YUSSEF (CONT'D)
Over there."|unknown||
25||"Ahmed finally spots it. He loads the rifle, but when he is
about to aim, the rifle fires. The shot hits amidst the
goats, lifting up a small cloud of dust."|location||
26||"YUSSEF (CONT'D)
What are you doing, you idiot?"|unknown||
27||"The jackal flees, terrified, while the goats scamper in
different directions."|location||
28||11   EXT. DESERT -- LATER|unknown||
29||"Both brothers are sitting under a tree, eating bread and
drinking water from a goatskin canteen."|location||
30||"YUSSEF
Zora doesn't mind."|unknown||
31||Ahmed keeps eating without turning to look at his brother.|location||
32||"AHMED
She doesn't, but I do.
YUSSEF
This is between her and me.
AHMED
You're both pigs. Next time I'm
going to tell my dad.
YUSSEF
Stay out of this."|unknown||
33||"If you want me to stay out of it,
don't do it."|unknown||
34||Yussef gets annoyed, stand up and leaves.|location||
35||12   EXT. DESERT -- DAY|unknown||
36||"The brothers are sitting apart from each other.   Ahmed guards
the goats with the rifle on his lap.
After a while, Yussef goes to sit behind a large rock. He
makes sure his brother isn't watching and he pulls his pants
down to start masturbating."|location||
37||"6.
When he is at his most concentrated, a shot rings out and
startles him. He quickly pulls his pants up and another
shot rings out. Yussef gets up to see what his brother is
doing.
Ahmed is aiming the rifle at a rock some two hundred yards
away. He fires a third time.
Yussef runs up to him.
YUSSEF
What are you doing?
Ahmed doesn't pay attention, and focuses on the rock in the
distance.
AHMED
Hassan said that it could hit things
three kilometers away, but it can't
even reach that rock over there.
YUSSEF
That's because you don't know how to
shoot. Give me the rifle.
Ahmed looks at his brother defiantly, then hands the rifle
over. Yussef aims and fires. The shot echoes through the
vast desert; the frightened goats scamper a few yards away.
AHMED
See, it can't reach it.
YUSSEF
Give me another bullet.
Yussef aims and fires. The bullet hits the rock and kicks
up a lot of whitish dust.
YUSSEF (CONT'D)
See.
AHMED
Yeah, but that's not three kilometers.
Ahmed remains pensive and suddenly starts climbing to the
top of the hill. Once at the top, he looks around for a
moment and then calls his brother.
AHMED (CONT'D)
Yussef, come here.
Yussef climbs the slope. Ahmed signals a road that in the
distance cuts across the great desert plain, and points out
a traffic sign that indicates a curve ahead.
7.
AHMED (CONT'D)
I bet you the bullet can't hit that
far away.
Ahmed loads the rifle and aims at the sign.    He fires and
nothing.
AHMED (CONT'D)
These fucking bullets aren't any
good.
YUSSEF
You're not aiming right.
Yussef points at a yellow car driving along the road.
YUSSEF (CONT'D)
What'll you give me if I hit that
car?
AHMED
I'll shoot.
Ahmed reloads. The empty cartridge falls to the ground. He
fires again - the car keeps going. Yussef asks for the rifle.
AHMED (CONT'D)
You see?    Nothing happens.
YUSSEF
Let me shoot.
He also drops the used cartridge on the ground, reloads and
shoots the traffic sign. He fires and nothing.
AHMED
I told you.    Hassan's a liar.
A bus approaches.    Ahmed points at it.
AHMED (CONT'D)
Shoot at that one...
Yussef loads the rifle parsimoniously, shuts the chamber,
raises the weapon, aims and fires.
The bus drives on.    Ahmed turns to his brother.
AHMED (CONT'D)
See: nothing.
The bus drives on another three hundred yards and suddenly
stops in the middle of the road.

AMELIA (CONT'D)
(Her entire story in
Spanish)
Once there was a hawk who wanted to
fly higher than everyone else. He
trained every day and hunted little
birds so he could eat them and be
strong.
MIKE
Pajaritos?     Little birds?
AMELIA
Of course, that's what hawks eat.
So, one day the hawk flew so, so
high that it crashed into an airplane.
It fainted and started to fall. And
when it was about to hit the ground,
all the birds flew toward him and
saved him.
DEBBIE
They saved him?
AMELIA
Yes, and when the hawk was healthy
again he went to talk to the birds
and said: I want to thank you for
saving me, but I can't change and
I'm going to keep hunting you. The
little birds answered: we don't care
that you hunt us, because that's who
you are. But we will always save
you, because that's who we are.
The children are silent.
AMELIA (CONT'D)
(In English)
Did you like it?
DEBBIE
No.
Amelia moves to turn out the light.
DEBBIE (CONT'D)
Leave it on.
Amelia stands still beside the switch.
AMELIA
Quedamos en que se iban a dormir con
la luz apagada.
DEBBIE
But I'm scared.

Pat died while she was sleeping.
AMELIA

when they're really little.
MIKE
Then why did daddy get so angry at
mommy?
AMELIA
He wasn't angry, he was just very
sad.
DEBBIE
He left."|unknown||

To forget everything, to be alone.

Alone?

girls play volleyball. They all compete intensely for the
point. There is excitement, but everything occurs quietly.
A player jumps and spikes the ball. Chieko (16), tall,
beautiful, with strands of hair painted purple, volleys the
ball back up. It reaches one of her teammates who sets up
another to spike it.
Chieko's team wins the point. The referee, instead of
whistling, lifts up a red flag.
The players congratulate each other silently, in sign

ABDULLAH
Give me that rifle...
Yussef turns to his father.
YUSSEF
They're going to kill us.
ABDULLAH
Give me that rifle.
He tries to wrest it away, but Yussef resists. The struggle
and Abdullah finally pulls it away. When Yussef tries to
snatch it back, the police fire a round of shots and the two
barely have time to hide.
The air is thick with gunshots. Yussef and Abdullah,
terrified, stick to the stones. The bullets strike very
close to them, and they can't even raise their heads.
Ahmed won't stop complaining.    Abdullah shouts at him.
ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
Ahmed, don't move.
The gunshots rain down for over a minute. When they stop,
Abdullah turns to look at Ahmed, who is lying motionless on
the rocks with bullet in his back.
ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
Ahmed!   Ahmed!
Oblivious of the police, he gets up and runs toward him.
Motionless, Ahmed just moans. With every breath, his shirt
grows bloodier.
ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
Ahmed!   Ahmed!
He rolls Ahmed over and lays his head on his lap. Abdullah
cannot stop crying. Yussef, ducking, runs toward his brother.
Abdullah laments nervously.
ABDULLAH (CONT'D)
Don't die, don't die.
Yussef is shocked upon seeing his dead brother. He stands
up and, without caring whether anyone fires at him or not,
he raises the rifle up in the air for the police to see that
he is not aiming, and starts to break it against the rocks.
When he's finished breaking it he opens his arms and walks
toward the police. One of them policemen looks at him through
a pair of binoculars. Alarid interrogates him.
ALARID
What's happening?

POLICE OFFICER
A boy is walking this way.
ALARID
Is he armed?
The officer takes a careful look.

It doesn't look like it.

What are the others doing?
The officer watches Abdullah carrying his wounded son.
POLICE OFFICER
A man is holding somebody injured.
ALARID
Is the other one still walking this
way?
POLICE OFFICER
Yes.
Alarid turns to the other officers.
ALARID
Aim.
The police aim and hold Yussef in their sights. He keeps
walking resolutely toward his aggressors. He is crying
softly, keeping his arms open.
Yussef walks until his is 10 meters away from the police and
he kneels with his arms open.
YUSSEF
I killed the American, I was the
only one who shot at you...
Cautious, the police still aim at his chest. Yussef proceeds
with his confession, babbling it through his nerves, his
pain and his attempt to control his sobbing.
YUSSEF (CONT'D)
They did nothing... nothing...
He turns to his father and his brother and points at them.
YUSSEF (CONT'D)
Kill me, but save my brother, he did
nothing... nothing...
Alarid moves in, aiming at him with a rifle.    Behind him are
five other cops, also ready to shoot.

takes her almost a minute to do so. Kenji, nervous because

Sir, there was an incident and...

No, I gave it to him.
