loves Tom today. HALL and OATES themselves walk with Tom
singing the song.
Cars stop at crosswalks to let Tom go by. The DRIVERS also
pump their fists in celebration of Tom's achievement last
night. He walks on, the man. We notice the sidewalk lights up
every time he touches the pavement like in ""Billie Jean"".
CARTOON BIRDS fly onto Tom's shoulder. He smiles and winks at

1. INT TOM'S BATHROOM - DAY
Tom shaves. Makes himself look presentable."|stage direction|||
1679||108.|unknown|||
1680||"LATER. Tom, now clean shaven and looking like he did when we
first met him, sketches on his bed with one hand while
holding a phone with the other.
2. EXT CITY SIDEWALK - DAY
Tom sits on a street corner drawing new additions to the
city's skyline.
2. INT LIBRARY - DAY
Tom sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears,
reading one of many Taschen books on innovative building
design.
3. INT OFFICE LOBBY - DAY
Tom drops off his portfolio with the security guard in the
lobby of a high-rise.
4. EXT SOCCER FIELD - DAY
Tom and his mom and step-dad cheer on his sister playing
soccer. It's a nice temporary distraction for him.
6. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY
Tom getting bad news on the phone. He has a list written on
his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of
futuristic looking structures). He crosses ""Abrams and
Abrams"" off the list. We notice several others are also
crossed off.
5. EXT GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY
Tom has his car on the side of the road and is out measuring
the distance between the beams of the bridge.
8. EXT PARK - DAY
Tom jogs. A little faster this time.
9. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Tom getting more bad news from the answering machine,
crossing off yet another firm from the list. Few remain. He
sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. For a beat, lost
in thought."|stage direction|||
1681||109.|unknown|||
1682||"Then, as if to shut those thoughts out, whatever they were,
he turns on the TV and joylessly watches the nothingness.
9. SPLITSCREEN - DAY
On the LEFT, Tom, alone, on a bus. Looking out the window.
Thinking.
On the RIGHT, Summer. In her wedding dress. The veil is
lifted. And she's a bride.
END MUSIC.

EXT OFFICE BUILDING - ANOTHER DAY
Tom, in a suit, exits a building after another dismal

Summer ages ago."|stage direction|||
