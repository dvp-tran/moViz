Winter 180 A.D.
Incongruously enough, the first sound we hear is a
beautiful tenor voice.  Singing.  A boy's voice.
CREDITS as we hear the haunting song float through dense
forests.  We finally come to a rough, muddy road slashing
through the forest.  On the road a GERMAN PEASANT FATHER
is herding along three sickly looking cows.  His two SONS
are with him.  His youngest son sits on one of the cows
and sings a soft, plaintive song.
They become aware of another sound behind them on the road
-- the creak of wood, the slap of metal on leather.  The
Father immediately leads his cattle and his sons off the
road.  They stand-still, eyes down:  the familiar posture
of subjugated peoples throughout history.
A wagon train rumbles past them.  Three ornate wagons
followed by a mounted cohort of fifty heavily-armed
PRAETORIAN GUARDS.
The young boy dares to glance up at the passing Romans.
His eyes burn with hatred."|stage direction||

elite Felix Regiment -- a legion of the Roman Army -- haul
the monstrous machines up a hill.
The commanding General of the Felix Regiment, MAXIMUS,
walks between two of the catapults.  He is a striking and
intense man in his 30's.  Like all the soldiers who

preparations are underway.  The catapults join ten others.
Archers are taking up position.  Brutal ""Scorpions"" --

enormous ""Greek fire pots"" -- large, round terra cotta

hundred Felix Regiment warriors surrounds them.  Steam
flares from their horses' nostrils.  They wait in a thick
stand of trees -- the German position can be seen across a
muddy plain.
A large wolf -- ""The Wolf of Rome"" -- waits at Maximus'
side.
Maximus nods to an archer.  The archer lights the tip of
an arrow and sends it flaming into the night sky."|stage direction||

-- Titus at his side -- the Felix Regiment screams out
fearsome war cries as they gallop across the muddy plain
toward the Germans --
Fire pots and flaming arrows are crashing down everywhere
around them --
The cavalry SLAMS into the Germans at full gallop --
It is carnage.
The Felix Regiment warriors slash ruthlessly with short
swords -- slicing a path of sheer destruction through the
Germans -- but the Germans fight with equal brutality --
and the Germans also fight with the desperation of a
hopeless last chance -- they pull and spear Roman soldiers
off horses whenever they can --
Maximus spins his horse and swings his sword with expert
efficiency -- a spear stabs through the neck of his horse
and it immediately collapses forward --
Maximus sails over the horse's head and crashes to the
muddy ground -- he jumps up and is in the midst of the
battle --
The flaming arrows and exploding fire pots create a
ferocious inferno everywhere around the battle -- the
flames silhouetting the fighting --
On the ground, Maximus proves his absolute worth as a
warrior -- he hacks and dodges -- ghastly images of true
ancient warfare -- Maximus' eyes burn with a zealous fire
as he fights for his life --
He finds he is momentarily at a terrible disadvantage --
Germans are surrounding him from all sides -- as he fights
he looks for an advantage -- for his soldiers -- for
anything -- he is doomed --
Then -- an almost mystical image -- Maximus' wolf leaps
through a wall of flame --
""The Wolf of Rome"" savages several Germans around Maximus
-- giving him the help he needed.
The wolf and his master fight, side-by-side."|stage direction||

metal brace extends from the back of his saddle.  He is
strapped to the brace with thick, leather straps.

cups are employed for blood-letting to balance ""humours.""
Anesthesia as we know it is nonexistent.  Wine amphoras
are passed around and orderlies fan narcotic smoke toward
the patients.  Mostly, though, they just hold down the
writhing patients.

in --
Each chariot has a driver and an archer, both dressed in
theatrical versions of the familiar Roman Lorica
Segmentata.
A chaos of dust -- and the battle is on --
The chariots zoom around the arena -- the archers keeping
up a deadly hail of arrows.
Maximus immediately dives onto a passing chariot and kills
the charioteer and archer -- he dramatically leaps from
the front of the chariot to a lead horse and cuts it free.
And Maximus takes control, we see the General of the Felix
Regiment gloriously alive again as he barks out orders and
leads his gladiators in battle.  They follow him
faithfully, his stern commands unquestioned.
His strategies are quick and smart, he makes the
gladiators work together.
This kind of slaughter could last for hours...
We see flashes of the endless battle... Maximus races on
his horse past another chariot, kills the driver, the
chariot smashes into a wall... the sun sinks lower, the
shadows on the sand lengthen... areas of the sand are
swamps of blood, Juba slips, pulls himself up fighting...
Maximus uses Vibius to create a diversion, two chariots
collide... the crowd roars... a gladiator is dragged
between a chariot and the side wall of the arena... the
drummers pound out their relentless tattoo...
Finally...
Maximus is on his horse across from the final chariot.
We can see that Juba and Vibius and a few other gladiators
are still alive.  The rest of the arena is polluted with
the dead and injured.
Maximus spurs his horse and gallops toward the final
chariot -- the charioteer whips his horses and zooms
toward Maximus --
The crowd is breathless -- watching the final battle --
Maximus and the chariot speed toward each other -- like
Medieval jousters --
And collide in a flashing explosion of steel --
Maximus sails from his horse -- as the charioteer sails
from his chariot --
Maximus lands hard but quickly pulls himself up, he races
to the final charioteer.  The charioteer is defeated but
not dead.
Maximus glances around, all his opponents are defeated.
He stands over the final charioteer.  Then he simply
tosses down his sword.
The crowd is stunned by this strange act of mercy.  But
then an enormous roar grows from the crowd -- wave after
wave of adulation for the hero of the day.
Maximus looks around, taking it all in.
Then he turns to the Imperial Box.
Maximus slowly walks to before the the Imperial Box.  The
Praetorian Archers immediately raise their bows, pointing

Maximus glares up at Commodus through his helmet mask.

slashing -- Tiger easily blocks and strikes back --
The sword play is very fast -- they block and parry and
hack like lightning -- constantly attacking -- they are
perfectly matched --
As he fights Maximus becomes aware of a strange sound over
the roar of the crowd -- a low rumbling -- then he feels
something -- a vibration in the ground --
Suddenly traps doors swing open and four enormous
platforms rise into view.  On each platform is a snarling
Bengal tiger restrained by a chain.  Tiger's teams of
""cornermen"" hold the chains through a pulley system.  The
cornermen are safely inside cages.  The platforms stop at
ground level.
The four ferocious tigers now mark the four corners of the
battleground.
Tiger takes advantage of Maximus' momentary confusion and
assaults brutally -- forcing him back toward one of the
tigers -- the tiger claws for Maximus -- Maximus just
evades it claws -- rolls for a new position -- another
tiger snaps at him --
Tiger attacks -- Maximus is on the defensive -- fighting
off Tiger and evading the four snarling beasts --
And then all four tigers are suddenly closer.  The teams
of cornermen are letting the chains play out, bit by bit,
gradually reducing the size of the battle ground.  The
crowd roars.
But the fight is hardly fair.
Whenever Tiger is near one of the tigers the cornermen
pull back the tiger slightly -- when Maximus is near a
tiger they let it out a bit.
Maximus and Tiger fight -- swirling action -- finally,
Maximus has the edge -- he circles so that the sun stabs
into Tiger's eyes -- then Maximus lunges forward under
Tiger's swinging sword and SLAMS into him -- they fall --
a tiger swats at Maximus' face -- he jerks his head back
-- he shoots out a leg and kicks Tiger's sword toward one
of the tigers -- it is out of reach -- Maximus leaps up
and stands over the winded Tiger, sword to his throat.
Tiger is gasping for breath, crushed.
Then one of Tiger's corners suddenly cheats -- they
completely release a tiger -- it leaps for Maximus --
Maximus barely has time to turn -- the tiger crashes into
him -- its claws slashing into his back, cutting through
his leather armor -- Maximus shoves an armored forearm
into the tiger's jaws and stabs with his sword --
Tiger takes this chance to pull himself up -- one of his
corners throws him another sword -- the crowd boos --
Maximus wrestles with the tiger -- spinning it around with
superhuman effort so it is always between himself and
Tiger -- so that Tiger can't get at him --
Maximus finally kills the tiger and leaps for Tiger -- he
quickly disarms him and tosses him to the ground --
Maximus stands over him -- ready to administer the coup de
grace.
All eyes turn to the Emperor.
Commodus slowly stands and steps to the edge of the
Imperial Box.  He raises his arm and gives the fatal
thumbs down.
Maximus looks up at him.
And then defiantly tosses the sword to the ground,
refusing to kill Tiger.
Commodus is stunned.
The crowd gasps -- a collective intake of breath -- and
then an enormous roar building.  It cascades around the
Colosseum.  It is a roaring celebration of the unexpected
act of mercy.  And the delicious act of defiance of the
Emperor.
Commodus slowly sits.
Maximus walks across the arena -- the people stand and
