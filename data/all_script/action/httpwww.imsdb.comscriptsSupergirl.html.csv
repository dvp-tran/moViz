2|THE CAMERA PULLS BACK. . .|stage direction
3|INT. ARGO CITY|location
4|"AND REVEALS THE inside of a domed city honeycombed with fantastic arches. The city is inhabited by young beautiful people in luxurious but simple costumes.
THE CAMERA ROAMS through the City, observing some people seated at a kind of cafe sipping drinks and relaxing; other people are in some kind of exercise class doing beautiful graceful movement; and finally a class of five year old children listen intently to a teacher who is demonstrating a molecular model."|stage direction
5|TEACHER|unknown
6|"And now, who can give me the electron
wave functions for Kryptonian covalent
bonding?"|location
7|"The five year olds eagerly raise their hands. The teacher points to one.
CHILD"|stage direction
8|The cube root of the wavelength over the|location
9|"natural log of the integral of the speed of
light squared.
The teacher smiles.
TEACHER"|stage direction
10|Well, maybe that was a bit too easy...|location
11|"THE CAMERA ROAMS ON through the city, following the sound of a strange, ethereally beautiful singing. The CAMERA discovers the source of the sound: an ARTIST sculpting a beautiful crystalline object with a MATTERWAND. The wand makes the singing noise as it creates matter out of energy. The Artist, whose name is ZALTAR, sometimes whistles along in counterpoint. .
A small girl is watching him with fascination. Her name is Kara, and she is seven.
Behind her, the dome, which encloses the City, marks the edge of the limbo outside.
KARA
What are you making:"|stage direction
12|"It's going to be a tree, I think.
KARA
What's a tree?"|stage direction
13|It's something they have on Earth. You know,|stage direction
14|Where is Earth?|stage direction
15|"Didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in
school?"|stage direction
16|"Yes, I know the equations---I just can't see it in
my head.
Zaltar laughs."|stage direction
17|ZALTAR|unknown
18|Even I have trouble with that sometimes. Earth is in|location
19|outer space. And we're in inner space.|stage direction
20|I don't understand.|stage direction
21|"Wait till you're older. Here -- watch this.
Zaltar takes a small OMEGAHEDRON out of his pocket and holds it in his hand."|stage direction
22|ZALTAR.|unknown
23|This is one of the four Power Sources of the City.|location
24|"I borrowed it from the Guardians. Look what I
can do with it.
Zaltar touches his MATTER.WAND to the OMEGAHEDRON and the wand instantly becomes charged with flickering light. He touches his wand to the tree sculpture---and the
sculpture comes alive with dancing lights and shadows. Kara claps her hands with delight
at the spectacle. Zaltar steps back and admires his handiwork. He carefully puts down the
OMEGAHEDRON at his feet, takes a small flask from his belt, and drinks."|stage direction
25|ZALTAR|location
26|You see, a tree is a living thing.|unknown
27|KARA|location
28|Can you create life?|unknown
29|ZALTAR|stage direction
30|No, no, just the illusion of life. A kind of|location
31|"half-life, maybe. A pale shadow of the real
thing. But it is lovely, the way the light plays
over the surface. . .
A woman's voice can be heard calling in the distance.
WOMAN'S VOICE
Kara. Kara.
Kara calls out in reply."|stage direction
32|KARA|unknown
33|"I'm here, mother.
Kara's mother ALURA appears through the lacey architecture of the city.
ALURA"|stage direction
34|Kara, you shouldn't be so near the Edge|location
35|without a grown-up.|stage direction
36|I'm sorry, Mother.|stage direction
37|"I was keeping an eye on her.
Alura puts her arm around her daughter affectionately, showing she's not really angry. Together they watch Zaltar's latest sculpture, flickering with the play of inner light and shadow.
ALURA"|stage direction
38|Thank you, Zaltar, but she has to obey the rules.|location
39|"Zaltar takes another swig from his flask. and lowers his voice confidentially.
ZALTAR"|stage direction
40|You and your husband have been kind to me,|location
41|"Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going
away. Soon."|stage direction
42|"But where?
Zaltar bends down to Kara and hands her his matterwand.
ZALTAR"|stage direction
43|Put your fingers there, Kara. And press hard.|location
44|"She does, and the wand makes a horrible squawk. Kara laughs with delight.
ZALTAR"|stage direction
45|Good. Now, go make something pretty.|location
46|"Kara scampers away, hardly able to believe her good fortune, and starts to make all kinds of
surprising sounds with the wand on the plaza nearby. Zaltar speaks to Alura in a low, confidential voice.
ZALTAR
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom
Zone."|stage direction
47|But the phantom Zone is for criminals.|stage direction
48|"It's big. And empty. I'm tired of limiting myself
to  Argo City. I want to do something new. I'm
starting to repeat myself here with this airy,
glittery stuff....
Zaltar waves a hand deprecatingly at the city around him.
ALURA"|stage direction
49|But Zaltar---you founded the city! It's yours. We|location
50|"were all just refugees from Krypton when you gathered
us together and brought us here, to the inner dimension.
You can't abandon us now. You have a responsibility to us!
In the background, Kara has been modeling a spiky insect-like CREATURE. Now she suddenly finds the OMEGAHEDRON on the ground beside her. She doesn't stop to wonder how it got there from beside Zaltar's feet. She simply picks up the OMEGAHEDRON and touches it to the spiky creature. The creature suddenly flicks its wings and COMES TO LIFE, unnoticed by the adults. Kara drops the wand and laughs out loud with delight as the magical creature takes off from the ground and starts flying in circles around her head, glittering as if it were made of diamonds.
ZALTAR
I'm an artist, Alura. My work comes first. Other
people come second."|stage direction
51|"How can you create beauty...with a selfish heart?
The spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. Her look of delight turns to fear. She tries to shoo the creature away. It flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
The spiky creature flies into the membrane and tears a ragged hole in it. With a giant WHOOSH all the air in the city starts to rush out the hole. Kara is swept along toward the hole by the wind. She cries out and stretches pleading hands toward her mother. THE OMEGAHEDRON is swept toward the hole as well. Kara grabs onto the ragged edge of the membrane.
ZALTAR
Kara---the Power Source!
Kara reaches for it, but it is too far from her, and the OMEGAHEDRON is sucked out into infinity by the wind. Zaltar picks up the matterwand from where Kara dropped it and touches her with the wand. She is instantly held fast. Zaltar pulls her back inside. He gives her to her mother Alura. Then Zaltar touches his wand to the membrane and seals the hole with masterful chords like a brass choir.
The wind dies down and all is silent, except for the quiet sobbing of Kara in her mother's arms. Zaltar kneels down beside her and strokes her golden hair  tenderly.
KARA"|stage direction
52|I'm sorry... I didn't know.|location
53|ZALTAR|unknown
54|It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use|location
55|the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.|stage direction
56|But the Power Source, Zaltar.|stage direction
57|"It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do
with three."|stage direction
58|But what will happen?|stage direction
59|"The Guardians will be angry. They may even
send me to the Phantom Zone. You see, I didn't
really have permission to borrow it. I must go
explain to them...
Zaltar hurries off nervously. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON KARA'S FACE as she senses this may be her last sight of Zaltar.
DISSOLVE TO:"|stage direction
60|EXT. A SPRINGTIME MEADOW - U.S.A. - DAY. UNDER TITLES|location
61|"A beautiful blonde in jeans and a frilly blouse is walking across a field of wildflowers. Butterflies flitter and dart from flower to flower. The blonde's name is SELENA. She is our ideal image of the girl next door, who grew up into a dynamite lady.
Her current boyfriend follows along behind her, lugging a big wicker hamper from their pickup truck parked at the edge of the road. Selena finds a grassy spot under an old oak. and spreads out a red and white checked gingham cloth..
SELENA
Over here George. It's the perfect spot. Nice view.
George sets down the wicker basket and Selena starts to unpack a scrumptious picnic of home cooked food. She unpacks fried chicken, hard-boiled eggs, potato salad, cold beer and a big rich creamy-frosted devils food cake."|stage direction
62|GEORGE|unknown
63|You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks|location
64|too pretty to eat.|stage direction
65|"Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's
all covered with ants.
She hands him a chicken drumstick and a hard-boiled egg."|stage direction
66|GEORGE|unknown
67|Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled|location
68|"down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle
down with than you.
SELENA"|stage direction
69|Why George, are you proposing?|location
70|GEORGE|unknown
71|"Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring
in much now, but...
SELENA"|stage direction
72|George---I thought you'd never ask.|location
73|"A shrill whistling sound from above makes them look up. With a loud plop and a spatter of icing the OMEGAHEDRON falls into the middle of the chocolate cake.
GEORGE"|stage direction
74|What the heck is that?|location
75|"They look up in the boughs of the tree overhead, and then down at the chocolate cake splashed all over the checked cloth.
SELENA
A squirrel Frisbee?
Selena reaches out and picks up the OMEGAHEDRON. It comes away from the cake without a trace of the chocolate icing sticking to its surface, as if made of some substance, which repels other kinds of matter.
Selena holds the shining Omegahedron in her hand and examines it, turning it around and around as if hypnotized. Her face takes on a new expression. Almost as if the simple, wholesome innocence of her nature had been blasted away by some profound new knowledge of the universe.
SELENA"|stage direction
76|That's funny. I'd swear I know just what this is,|location
77|"but I've never seen it before.
She stands up and walks across the checkered cloth, in a beeline for the pickup truck.
GEORGE"|stage direction
78|Hey, where you going?|location
79|"SELENA
(calling over her shoulder)"|unknown
80|I've got things to do.|stage direction
81|What about my proposal?|stage direction
82|(dismissively)|unknown
83|"Call me next week. Maybe we can have lunch.
She gets in the pickup and. drives away.
GEORGE
Hey! My truck!
DISSOLVE TO:"|stage direction
84|"She is ten years older now, a young lady. Almost ready to assume the long flowing gown of an adult, but still in the tunic worn by those under eighteen.
ALURA"|stage direction
85|(voice over)|unknown
86|But Kara, you are too young to go.|location
87|"ANOTHER ANGLE. ARGO CITY. DIMMED
They are in the assembly amphitheater of the city, where the kindergarten nuclear physics class was seen. Kara is in the centre of the ring, with adults seated in scattered rows around her. Her parents Zor-El and Alura are standing in front of her.
KARA"|stage direction
88|I am almost an adult. This is what I want.|location
89|ZOR-EL|stage direction
90|But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to|location
91|Earth. The journey is dangerous.|stage direction
92|It was my fault we lost the Power Source.|stage direction
93|Years ago. And it was Zaltar who stole it.|stage direction
94|I allowed it to escape the City.|stage direction
95|"Ever since we told you how your cousin Superman
was sent there as an infant, all you have wanted to do
was visit this place."|stage direction
96|"Yes, I do want to go. But someone must go. Our
scanning shows the Power Source has finally
reached the Earth. It could destroy everything unless
someone brings it back."|stage direction
97|Superman will return it.|stage direction
98|"Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should
have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He
may be dead.
ZOR-EL
But what can you, a mere girl-"|stage direction
99|"I'll have super powers there. Like him. We can't wait.
Our lights are fading. Look around you. When I was a
child the City was bright and shining. Look at it now.
Zor-El and Alura sigh. There is no denying that the brilliance of Argo City has been much dimmed since Kara was a little girl."|stage direction
100|ALURA|unknown
101|What do your teachers think?|location
102|Zor-El looks around the circle. A beautiful woman speaks.|stage direction
103|TEACHER|unknown
104|It would be sad to lose one of our finest young ones|location
105|"to the dimension barrier-- but the City cannot last much
longer without the Power Source. It is her future she's
fighting for, Zor-El."|stage direction
106|"Very well, let it be done.
Alura embraces Kara emotionally, fighting back the tears. Kara too is struggling to control her own emotions.
KARA"|stage direction
107|Don't worry, Mother, I'll be all right. I've studied|location
108|"the transmissions from Earth. I know their customs.
Kara walks out of the amphitheater with her parents.
ALURA"|stage direction
109|But they are such strange, unstable people.|location
110|KARA|unknown
111|Then I will learn to act strange like them.|location
112|Kara holds up a small handbag. Inside we glimpse red and blue material.|stage direction
113|KARA|unknown
114|I have made clothing and copies of their money, I|location
115|"will be fine.
Her father puts his hand on her shoulder ."|stage direction
116|ZOR-EL|unknown
117|Be brave, my .daughter. Be wise.|location
118|KARA|unknown
119|As brave as my father. As wise.|location
120|They embrace, briefly. Kara then steps onto a circular platform set into the pavement of the city.|stage direction
121|"Her parents watch as she floats away.
She passes into an air lock through the membrane that surrounds the City, and off into an infinity of space.
MONTAGE: THE JOURNEY OF KARA INSIDE ""HER SPHERE FROM THE INNER DIMENSION TO OUR WORLD.
Her sphere moves from blackness, to a dark green limbo. The atmosphere thickens around her. Soon it is unmistakably water, and she is heading toward the light above. A fish darts past with a flash of silver. The sphere rushes upward faster and faster. It breaks the surface of the , water. Kara springs free of the bubble, which disappears. She is now wearing a blue and red costume like her cousin Superman.
She lands on a nearby beach."|stage direction
122|EXT. EARTH.  BEACH BESIDE THE SEA. SUNRISE|location
123|"She looks around her, feasting with her eyes on the details of this new exciting world.
Kara bends down and picks up a stone from the ground at her feet. To her astonishment, she
crushes it to powder in her hand, and blows the fine dust away with a blast of superbreath.
She looks down at her feet, so firmly planted on the ground. She rises a few inches into the air, and reacts with amazement. Then she looks up into the blue sky overhead and her expression of astonishment is replaced by a look of joyous longing. With a sudden impulse she shoots straight upward."|stage direction
124|EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE EARTH.  DAY|location
125|Kara loops and rolls, swoops and circles, laughing with sheer delight.|stage direction
126|EXT. HIGH ABOVE MOUNTAIN MEADOWS.  HORSES.  DAY|location
127|"Kara swoops down at a herd of horses. The herd parts and gallops off in all directions as she pulls out of her dive and flies away.
CUT TO:"|stage direction
128|EXT. MOUNTAINTOP.  DAY|location
129|"Kara lands on a mountaintop and admires the view. The she bends down and scoops up a handful of snow. She stares at it with awe.
INSERT. MICROSCOPIC SHOT OF SNOW CRYSTALS IN ALL THEIR INFINITE VARIETY AND BEAUTY.
BACK TO SCENE.  DAY
Kara stands up, smiling. She flies into the air again."|stage direction
130|EXT. FOREST.  DAY|location
131|She lands and walks among the huge trunks of a primeval forest. Shafts of sunlight pierce the gloom. These trees are much more impressive than Zaltar's imitation back in Argo City. She hears a mournful sound and pulls back a spray of brambles. She sees a BABY DEER hopelessly tangled in the long canes. She shoots RAYS OF HEAT VISION from her eyes and slices through the tough stems. The fawn scrambles free, and scampers off into the forest. Kara watches it with a benevolent smile. She removes a brunette wig and some street clothing from a secret pocket in her cape.|stage direction
132|EXT. MANSION --- GARDEN PARTY|location
133|"A big impressive house somewhere in the Middle West. People mill about on the neatly manicured lawn sipping drinks and snagging hors d'oeuvres off silver trays from. passing waiters. All the quests have a name tag on, like at some kind of conference.
SELENA, the blonde who discovered the Power Source, is circulating among the quests. She has changed since we saw her last. No longer the girl next door, she now wears a fabulous designer dress dripping with jewels. She walks with the regal air of someone used to being obeyed, and graciously accepts the homage of the quests. A smile, a nod, a kind word from her leaves them all basking in the warm afterglow of her attention. But we notice odd details of the party: the decorations are all based on mystic occult symbols. At the refreshment table, there is a big ten-foot WICKER SCULPTURE OF A FEMALE GOAT covered with paper flowers. And the quests all have an indefinable air of strangeness about them. BIANCA, a tall cold-eyed brunette in black silk dress, whispers in Selena's ear .
BIANCA"|stage direction
134|Be careful. Nigel is going to try something.|location
135|SELENA|unknown
136|Don't worry about old Nigel, I can take care of him.|location
137|"He's just a sore loser.
An ELDERLY MAN in a three-piece pin-stripe suit grabs her elbow.
ELDERLY MAN"|stage direction
138|I don't want much, Selena. I have simple tastes.|location
139|"SELENA
What do you want?"|stage direction
140|Western Europe.|stage direction
141|"I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could
have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski."|stage direction
142|"No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
Selena leaves him negotiating boundary lines with Bianca and strolls over to a sour-faced man in suede who has been scowling at her over his cigarette.
SELENA
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
NIGEL"|stage direction
143|It may well be. I know how you won that election|location
144|Selena. You can't fool me.|stage direction
145|"I have plans Nigel. You could come with me...
I'm going places."|stage direction
146|NIGEL|unknown
147|You're not going anywhere. Except back to nowheresville.|location
148|"You're too impatient, Selena. Look around you--all
these people have served years and years of apprenticeship.
Some of their families have been in the Craft for generations.
You can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
Selena smirks at him, self-confidently.
SELENA"|stage direction
149|I just did. Because I have the Power.|location
150|NIGEL|unknown
151|You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow|location
152|"is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
Nigel drops his cigarette, stubs it out on the lawn, and takes out his platinum cigarette case.
SELENA
Bianca's taught me all! need to know. I'll be safe, as
long as I don't go too far."|stage direction
153|"Cigarette?
He holds the shiny mirror-like cigarette case in front of her so she can see her reflection.
INSERT. SURFACE OF THE CIGARETTE CASE. Selena's reflection. She is still the glamorous beauty, but looming behind her...invisible to ordinary eyes...is a DARK EERIE SHAPE OF SOMETHING HIDEOUS.
BACK TO SCENE.
Quick as a cat, Selena bats the cigarette case out of his hand and sends it spinning into the shrubbery. All traces of the Shadow behind her have disappeared."|stage direction
154|NIGEL|unknown
155|Sorry. Forgot you were trying to quit.|location
156|"Nigel snags a glass of champagne off the tray of a nearby waiter and sips it insolently.
SELENA"|stage direction
157|Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering|location
158|"back.
Nigel shakes his head.
NIGEL"|stage direction
159|You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save|location
160|you from a terrible fate.|stage direction
161|"I need you like an Eskimo needs a lawnmower. Now
burn rubber.
Nigel locks eyes with her.
NIGEL"|stage direction
162|Make me.|location
163|"He takes another insolent sip of champagne...arid discovers a scorpion perched on the rim of his glass.
Nigel spits out the champagne and, drops the glass. Everyone laughs at him.
NIGEL"|stage direction
164|Balefire on you, Selena!|location
165|"SELENA
(grinning)"|unknown
166|You Scorpios can never take a joke.|location
167|All quests have fallen silent, staring at the altercation between the two of them.|stage direction
168|NIGEL|unknown
169|You think you are on top now. Well there is someone|location
170|coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.|stage direction
171|"Throw him out.
Two burly waiters seize Nigel and drag him off toward the valet parking.
NIGEL"|stage direction
172|You won't last a year, Selena. The cards don't lie!|location
173|"The crowd breaks into a buzz of conversation.
Bianca stands up on a chair. The crowd falls silent."|stage direction
174|BIANCA|unknown
175|Let's not let one rotten apple spoil the party. I give you|location
176|"the first woman in eight hundred years to head
the Circle: Selena!
Applause. Selena steps up onto a raised dais. And holds up her hands in an invocational gesture.
SELENA"|stage direction
177|Thank you, sisters and brothers of the Craft. It is a|location
178|"great honor you have given me, and I will try to be
worthy. And when my secret plans are revealed --
you will learn that we are on the threshold of
power and influence undreamed of when Nigel was
our leader.
More applause. One of the cooks applauding at the refreshment table knocks over a fuel-pot under a chafing dish. The fuel-pot falls on the ground at the base of the wicker goat statue."|stage direction
179|SELENA|unknown
180|And now, ,I call upon the Great Mother--the spirit|location
181|"of Nature --- to bless all our endeavors in the
coming year...
A woman in the .audience screams. Everyone looks where, she is pointing. The huge ten-foot tall wicker statue ,bursts into flames.
Panic and pandemonium. Some of the quests run for safety. Others try to throw water onto the blazing, torch-like statue, but in vain. Selena frowns at the spectacle, and, without a word, turns and stalks into her house."|stage direction
182|INT. SELENA'S HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM|location
183|"THE CAMERA FOLLOWS Selena through the French doors and into her large living room. On one wall is a huge, ornate gold-framed MIRROR, covered with a thick veil.
Selena sits down in front of a large hearth, and opens a secret compartment in the floor. She reaches inside and removes a finely wrought METAL BOX IN THE SHAPE OF A GARGOYLE and a pack of cards. She puts the gargoyle box on her lap, and begins to cast tarot cards onto the floor in mystic patterns.
The Elderly Man in the pinstripe suit enters from the garden. Outside the excited shouts and sounds of firefighting can still be heard. Someone runs by in the b.g. with a coil of garden hose. The Elderly Man walks over to Selena, timidly.
ELDERLY MAN
Is this Nigel's doing?
SELENA"|stage direction
184|It's a warning, that's for sure.|location
185|ELDERLY MAN|unknown
186|Maybe it was just an accident.|location
187|"SELENA
(mysteriously)"|unknown
188|There's no such thing as an accident. Everything has|location
189|"meaning, if you can read the signs.
The elderly man looks down at the pattern of tarot cards Selena has cast on the floor.
ELDERLY MAN"|stage direction
190|Then what does it mean???|location
191|"Selena shrugs and puts aside her cards.
SELENA"|stage direction
192|"Don't ask me. I can't read the signs worth spit.
EXT. MIDVALE SCHOOL. DAY"|location
193|In front of the school, LUCY LANE, one of the older girls, is batting in a softball game. She swings and hits one over the fence for a homer. Linda watches the excited, deliriously happy girls---wondering if she will ever be able to share such strong group emotions. Linda walks up the steps to the main building.|stage direction
194|INT. MAIN BUILDING. MIDVALE SCHOOL. STAIRWAY|location
195|"Linda walks up the long stairway in the entrance hall.
MYRA, the school bully, passes with her spy and toady the loathsome MUFFY. As they pass MYRA speaks in a loud voice.
MYRA"|stage direction
196|Geeze, another barfy new student. They're really|location

202|Don't you believe in knocking?|location
203|"LINDA
Oh, yes. Knocking. The pre-entry signal. I forgot.
She knocks on the open door. Her manner is so open and guileless that MR. Danvers, though
he gives her a strange look, does not put it down to smart-aleckyness, as he normally would.
MR. DANVERS
What can I do for you?"|stage direction
204|"I'm Linda Lee.
My cousin wrote you.
MR. Danvers stares at her blankly. He's a bit absent-minded.
MR . DANVERS
Cousin? Wrote me?
Linda looks at the metal filing cabinet behind his desk.
Two beams of X-RAY VISION are faintly visible for an instant from her eyes.
LINDA"|stage direction
205|The letter's in your files. Under K, for Kent.|location
206|MR. Danvers opens his file and searches through it.|stage direction
207|LINDA|unknown
208|I mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.|location
209|MR. DANVERS|unknown
210|Here it is. Oh...of course. You're the orphan. I'm so sorry|location
211|"about your parents. We'll try to make you happy here.
He rises and walks around the desk toward her. He puts his hand on her shoulder in a fatherly fashion.
CUT TO:"|stage direction
212|EXT. CAMPUS. DORM|location
213|"MR. Danvers is carrying her suitcase as he shows her around the campus.
MR DANVERS"|stage direction
214|...since your school records were lost in the fire, we'11|location
215|"start you out easy first. You'll have English, Latin,
French, History, Art, Chemistry, Math, Biology

I think we'll put you in ""G"" dorm.
He opens the door and ushers her into the dorm."|stage direction

A girl dorm monitor sees him and yells out the traditional signal.

His knife turns by itself on the floor until its blade points outward. Everyone joins hands in the circle. A fire springs to life on the hearth. Someone starts to chant in a strange ancient tongue. Slowly the heavy, opulent living room begins to change: the carpet becomes the floor of an ancient stone temple with dark brown stains splattered across its massive granite blocks, the walls start to melt away. Outside the windows the dark night is replaced by hot, brutal sunlight pounding down on an endless desert stretching away to the horizon.
The house completely dissolves and is replaced by monumental stone ruins. The smoky fire crackles and sends its dark plumes boiling skyward. The only thing remaining of Selena's house is the hearth and the Coffer of Shadow. Selena stands up And walks out of the centre of the circle toward the Coffer. She opens the lid. She pulls the glass vial off the golden chain
around her neck and drops it into the Coffer.

Selena steps forth from the column of fire. She is clothed in a shimmering garment---white with flashing highlights of rainbow iridescence. The six other members of her group fall to their knees in awe. Selena seems to glow with an inner radiance.

She glances meaningfully at the faggots piled around his feet and walks away.
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS HER revealing that she has been talking to Ethan inside the mammoth fireplace of her living room. Her new house is enormous. Where before she lived in a mansion, now she dwells in a palace. The fireplace is seven feet high, the living room floor is wide as a football field, and. the French windows into the garden now tower like the windows in the North transept of Chartres Cathedral. Selena disappears out the imposing portals which lead to the wet bar and butler's pantry--each now the size of a basketball court.
Back in the fireplace, Ethan cranes his neck to make sure she has gone, then reaches out toward the glass hanging nearby. He pokes the straw with his forehead. The glass swings slightly. The glass swings close enough for him to bump it with his forehead and set up a rhythm. He gauges the swing of the glass and, at the precise moment, grabs for it with his mouth. He catches hold of the rim of the glass with his teeth and holds it there for a moment as he summons his courage to do what must be done. He bites hard on the rim of the glass with his teeth.
The glass shatters and falls to the floor with a crash, leaving Ethan with a small fragment of the rim in his mouth and a trickle of blood down his chin. He leans his head over until it is directly above his left hand tied to the stake two and a half feet below his shoulders. A droplet of blood falls into his hand. He drops the glass fragment down to his hand and catches it. He grins, and sighs with relief. Then spits to clear his mouth. Slowly he saws. at the ropes that hold him with the sliver of glass in his left hand. One by one the strands part.
Ethan strains against his bonds and the weakened rope snaps. He quickly disentangles himself from the coils and steps out of the fireplace. He looks around the mammoth room. The coast is clear. He spits a few bits of glass out of his mouth, and dashes out of the doors

He drops the hose as if stung by an electric eel and turns to see her emerge from behind a large strangler fig.
INSERT ETHAN'S P.O.V.
The same effect as when he drank the love potion the first time. The plants of the conservatory swirl and distort in garish nightmare colours. At the centre of his vision is an area of crystal clarity surrounding Selena. She approaches him seductively, fully confident of her power.

1502|"Supergirl steps toward the corner of the room beside the mirror where the Real Selena is imprisoned in the cloud of blackness. Supergirl touches the SHADOW with her wand. There is a cosmic musical chord, and the SHADOW is destroyed; it falls to the floor in a rain of hard, dark cinders.
The Real Selena rises from the corner of the room where she was released from the grip of the shadow. She looks at herself in the mirror. She is changed into the softer, more innocent person she was at the picnic before she found the Omegahedron. THERE IS NO MORE EVIL SHADOW LOOMING BEHIND HER IN THE MIRROR REFLECTION. She turns to Supergirl and Ethan.

EXT . HAMBURGER HEAVEN. GAS STATION. DAY
All the people of Midvale are enthusiastically chopping up the billboard portraits of Selena and throwing them into a bonfire in the middle of the street. Statues, banners, mystic symbols, giant tarot cards, old uniforms of her palace guards and youth group --every last remnant of her regime joins the blaze. People are smiling, dancing, holding hands, drinking: the atmosphere is like a block party on the first week in spring.
