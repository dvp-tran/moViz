Long, matted hair coils onto his shoulders, and an unkempt

stand watching, Kirkhill raises a pair of powerful field
glasses.
KIRKHILL'S POV - TELEPHOTO
The image of the Huey seems to waver insubstantially
through the long lens.  It looks like a death ship, the
Flying Dutchman with a crew of corpses and a demon at the
helm, coming in out of the dusk sky.
He slowly lowers the glasses.
Face ashen, Kirkhill backs into the command center and
closes the door.
The Huey sheers sideways across the staging area.
Its skids clip the top of the MOTC, shearing off
communications gear.
It hits the ground.  Bounces.
Slews around, scraping hideously.
And stops.
The Sikorsky settles behind it.
The two choppers whine-down.  Standing beside the cockpit,
Trautman gets on the Sikorsky's loudspeaker."|stage direction

Rambo goes to the gun door.  Takes De Fravio's AK-47.
