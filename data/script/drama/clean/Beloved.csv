field. The field stretches beyond, until a line of distant
woods stops it. Around the back of the house stands a rundown
STORAGE SHED, a cold house, a privy and a water pump. A porch
with a single door serves as the only entrance.
Camera begins a slow move toward the house as we;
SUPER - OHIO, 1865

lucky. You got one child left, still
pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had
eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one
of them gone from me. Four taken, four
chased and all, I expect, worrying
somebody's house into evil. My first born

she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her

My two girls, sold and gone before I

without their grown up teeth yet. My
third child, my son after Halle...I let
that straw boss have me for four months
so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he
had him traded for lumber anyway and me
pregnant with his child. I couldn't love
that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the

Sethe is pumping water into a bucket for clothes washing. A
gentle breeze carries a LEAF into the bucket. Sethe sees it
floating atop the water for a moment, then picks it up.

feeling a memory - from long ago.

back, coming up Bluestone Road. He wears no hat.
Sethe breathes easily. She looks around her -the reality of
124's barren field has returned. The memory of Sweet Home's
sycamores have vanished.
Denver is playing near the road. As the wagon nears 124,
Denver looks up and smiles. The Man whips the horse hard so
as to ride past the house faster. The children stare at
Denver and 124, with horror and curiosity.
The stares of the children destroy Denver's smile. She
watches them go, then turns to hide her upset and sees her
mother watching her.
Sethe looks to Denver with empathy and impotence: wanting to
ease her daughter's pain and knowing full well she cannot.
Hurt and angry, Denver runs past Sethe, towards the woods."|stage direction||

going.
She reaches FIVE BOXWOOD BUSHES planted in a ring. The tall
bushes stretch toward each other four feet off the ground,
forming a round, emerald room in the center, seven feet high,
with walls fifty inches thick of murmuring leaves.
This is Denver's private place. She bends low and crawls
through the leaves into the center. Once there, this lonely
child wipes away her tears and tries to pull herself
together. She lays her face against the cool earth."|stage direction||

Sweet Home. Even if that whole farm and

what happened there once, will happen
again."|speech|SETHE|F

That's why you can never go there."|speech|SETHE|F
