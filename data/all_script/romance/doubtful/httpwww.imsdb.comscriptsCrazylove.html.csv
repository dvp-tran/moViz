3||"The sweet silence of slumber. Suddenly, an alarm clock on a
nightstand SHRIEKS the operatic tones of Maria Callas.
A well-manicured hand, nails painted pink, slaps the snooze
button and mutes Maria. A few seconds reprieve.
Then, another clock, stationed on a dresser, broadcasts the
FORTISSIMO POUNDING of the ""William Tell Overture."" Toes,
also painted pink, swing out of bed and run to the dresser.
LETTY MAYER, late 20s and beautiful, turns off the music.
She opens a dresser drawer and surveys panties that are
arranged by color, from white to beige to black. Behind the
panties are rows of bras, also organized by color. Letty
pulls out some taupe undergarments, checks them against her
nails and replaces them in favor of a pink bra and panties.
Letty goes to her closet and removes a tailored, pink linen
suit. She lays it on the bed. Beast, her cat, jumps on the
bed and settles into the jacket. Letty swoops the animal off
her clothes and brushes cat hair from the suit."|stage direction

you about linen?"|unknown
