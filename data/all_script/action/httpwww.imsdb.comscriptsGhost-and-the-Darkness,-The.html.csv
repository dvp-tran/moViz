FADE IN ON
A TINY FIGURE OF A MAN hurrying toward camera. The figure gets
larger as he approaches. But as yet we cannot tell who he is or
where we are."|stage direction
1|MALE VOICE (over)|"This is the most famous true story
of Africa. It happened a hundred
years ago, but even now, when
children ask about it, you do not
tell them at night."|speech

to grow)"|location
3|MALE VOICE (over)|"It began with the race to build a
railroad across Africa."|speech
4||(beat)|location
5|MALE VOICE (over)|"But this is not about building a
railroad- it is about Patterson."|speech
6||"And now we can tell that the FIGURE is a YOUNG MAN, A LIEUTENANT
COLONEL. This is PATTERSON. He is gifted and bright and serious,
serious about his life, serious about his career. He has been
successful in everything he's attempted, in part because of his
talents, in part because he is willing to outwork anybody.
AND THIS IS WHERE WE ARE: ENGLAND.
More specifically, in a high-ceilinged corridor of an elegant
building - lovely woodwork all around. Everything is neat,
everything is clean and in order."|stage direction
7|MALE VOICE (over)|"Patterson was thirty. A brilliant
engineer. A fine man, but do not
become attached to him- there are
many fine men in this story but do
not become attached to any of them."|speech
8||(beat)|location
9|MALE VOICE (over)|So many of them die.|speech
10||Patterson stops at a large ornate door, knocks. Waits.|stage direction
11|MALE VOICE (over)|"And remember this: only the
impossible parts of what follows
really happened..."|speech
12||"(Now the door opens
and we-)"|location
13||"CUT TO
Just a wonderfully handsome man standing in the doorway. This is
ROBERT BEAUMONT - 40, with an irresistable smile. We're in his
office and the place reflects the man - clean, cold. There are
maps and charts on the walls. He ushers Patterson inside."|stage direction
14||(The great smile flashes)|location
15|BEAUMONT|"John Henry Patterson, come in. I'm
Robert Beaumont."|speech
16||(They shake hands)|location
17|BEAUMONT|"Firm- I like that, tells me a lot
about you-"|speech
18||(beat)|location
19|BEAUMONT|"-now why don't you tell me about me?
To get you started, many people find
me handsome, with a wonderful smile.
I'm sure you agree."|speech
20||"(Surprised, uncomfortable,
Patterson nods)"|location
21|BEAUMONT|Winning personality, heaps of charm?|speech
22|PATTERSON|"My wife is the game player in the
family, sir."|speech
23|BEAUMONT|Games?|speech
24||(staring dead at Patterson)|location
25|BEAUMONT|"Look at me closely, Patterson: I am
a monster. My only pleasure is
tormenting people who work for me,
such as yourself."|speech
26||"(again the smile - only
now it's chilling)"|location
27|BEAUMONT|"One mistake and I promise you this:
I'll make you hate me."|speech
28||"CUT TO
PATTERSON, as he realizes Beaumont is serious. Beaumont turns
sharply and moves to a large map.
CUT TO
THE MAP. It covers a great deal of East Africa with a very clear
line that ends at Lake Victoria, a distance of some 600 miles."|stage direction
29||(pointing along the line)|location
30|BEAUMONT|"We are building this railroad
across Africa for the glorious
purpose of saving Africa from the
Africans. And, of course, to end
slavery. The Germans and French
are our competition. We are ahead,
and we will stay ahead providing
you do what I hired you to do-"|speech
31||"CUT TO
A MORE DETAILED MAP. This one ends at ""Tsavo,"" 130 miles in."|stage direction
32|BEAUMONT|"-build the bridge over the Tsavo
river. And be finished in four
months time. Can you do that?"|speech
33|PATTERSON|"I'm sure you've examined my record.
So you know I've never yet been
late on a bridge."|speech
34|BEAUMONT|You've never built in Africa.|speech
35|PATTERSON|"But I have in India- every country
presents problems."|speech
36|BEAUMONT|"You'll need your confidence, I
promise you."|speech
37|PATTERSON|"I've got a reason far beyond
confidence: my wife is having our
firstborn in five months and I
promised I'd be with her when the
baby comes."|speech
38|BEAUMONT|"Very moving, Patterson; I'm touched
you confided in me."|speech
39||(beat)|location
40|BEAUMONT|"But I don't really give a shit about
your upcoming litter. I've made you
with this assignment-"|speech

42|BEAUMONT|-don't make me break you.|speech
43||(smiling right back)|location
44|PATTERSON|You won't have the chance.|speech
45||(glancing at his watch)|location
46|PATTERSON|Any further words of encouragement?|speech
47||(silence)|location
48|PATTERSON|Then I've a train to catch.|speech
49||"They look at each other a moment in silence - and it's very clear
they do not like each other. Patterson turns, leaves and we
CUT TO
A RAILWAY STATION, IMMEDIATELY AFTER
A train is loading up. A lot of activity, a lot of noise.
Patterson stands in the midst of it, anxiously looking around.
CUT TO
HELENA PATTERSON, hurrying through the crowd. Early 20s, with the
kind of serene beauty of Jean Simmons. She is still slim, has not
begun to show. She spots him, puts a smile on, goes straight into
his arms."|stage direction
50|HELENA|"I tried to be late, John- it would
have been easier if you'd gone."|speech
51||"(They are nutty about
each other - he nods)"|location
52|PATTERSON|"We're not much good at goodbyes,
Helena."|speech
53||(brightly)|location
54|HELENA|"Tell me about Beaumont- does he
understand how brilliant you are,
how lucky he is to have you?"|speech
55|PATTERSON|"It was embarrassing- the man showered
me with compliments."|speech
56||"They start to walk hand in hand along the platform toward a
quieter place. Patterson is suddenly very serious-"|stage direction
57|HELENA|Oh dear-|speech
58||(beat)|location
59|HELENA|"-you're geting that downtrodden look
again-"|speech
60|PATTERSON|-well, it's just...|speech
61||(beat)|location
62|PATTERSON|"...other men don't abandon their wives
at such a time-"|speech
63||(not unkindly)|location
64|HELENA|"-oh please- if I'd been against your
taking this, you would have abandoned
me. You've been desperate to see Africa
your whole life."|speech
65|PATTERSON|What if there are complications?-|speech
66|HELENA|"-not ""what if""- there will be, there
always are. Which only means that our
""son"" and I- note my confidence- will
have an excuse to come visit."|speech
67||THE TRAIN WHISTLE sounds.|stage direction
68|HELENA|Go, now.|speech
69||(He kisses her hand)|location
70|HELENA|Such a gentleman.|speech
71||(Now he holds her)|location
72|PATTERSON|"I am desperate to see Africa- but I
hate the leaving."|speech

HELENA. She hates it, too."|stage direction
74|HELENA|You build bridges, John-|speech
75||(beat)|location
76|HELENA|-you've got to go where the rivers are.|speech
77||"They hold each other a moment more, then break, then back into
each other's arms a final time, then-
CUT TO
THE TRAIN, and thick clouds of steam-
-Patterson runs into the clouds and disappears.
HOLD FOR A MOMENT.
KEEP HOLDING.
Patterson runs out of the steam and we
PULL BACK TO REVEAL
A DIFFERENT TRAIN, A DIFFERENT COUNTRY, A DIFFERENT WORLD.
This is the train to TSAVO and Patterson is alone on the engine
seat- a wooden bench in front of the engine used by railroad
inspectors and visiting VIPs. Behind it is a white circular piece
of wood used to keep the engine heat from the passengers.
CUT TO
NIGEL STARLING, running as best as he can alongside the train,
trying to pull himself up onto the engine seat.
STARLING is a terribly appealing young man. Clothes do not fit him
well, and he is constantly tugging at this sleeve or that
shirttail, trying to get things right. He wears glasses, tends
nonetheless to squint at the world. He is, above all, a good man,
morally impeccable and very much a product of these Victorian
times."|stage direction
78||"(as Patterson helps
him aboard)"|location
79|STARLING|Many thanks.|speech
80||(squints)|location
81|STARLING|You're Patterson, yes?|speech
82||(Patterson nods)|location
83|STARLING|"Nigel Starling- I'll be assisting you
at Tsavo- but surely Beaumont must
have told you that."|speech
84|PATTERSON|"He just gave me his ""monster"" speech."|speech
85|STARLING|"That. I know Robert seems dreadful,
but when you truly get to know the man,
well, he's much worse."|speech
86||(beat)|location
87|STARLING|And I'm one of his defenders.|speech
88||(Patterson smiles)|location
89|STARLING|"Forget him for now- it's your first
ride to Tsavo- I think you'll find it
breathtaking."|speech
90||(And on that word-)|location
91||"CUT TO
STARLING coughing like crazy, hands over his face which is caked
with dust- he and Patterson stare out at an absolutely dreary
desert."|stage direction
92||(shouting toward Starling)|location
93|PATTERSON|"""Breathtaking"" doesn't begin to do it
justice."|speech
94||"(As Starling starts to
laugh, his mouth opens
and sand flies in, and
his coughing fit returns
and)"|location
95||"CUT TO
THE DESERT. ENDLESS. LATER IN THE DAY.
CUT TO
THE TWO OF THEM, bent over, arms covering their faces as the dust
gets worse- a wind has kicked up.
CUT TO
THE TRAIN, TRYING TO MAKE IT UP A STEEP GRADE. STILL LATER.
Patterson and Starling are walking beside the train now, helping
to push it, trudging through the dust. All the other passengers
spread out behind them, also pushing- the train obviously needs
all the assistance it can get.
CUT TO
INSIDE A RAILROAD CAR, EARLY EVENING.
Patterson and Starling, filthy, sit together. Starling has nodded
off. Patterson has a book open in his lap-
-we can tell there are drawings of African animals- not all that
accurate.
Now Patterson's eyes close and he sleeps.
CUT TO
THE TRAIN POUNDING THROUGH THE NIGHT.
Stokers shovel coal. They are exhausted but they keep at it.
CUT TO
PATTERSON. WAKING IN THE CAR, RUBBING HIS EYES. IT'S DAWN.
He stares out-
-and from his face it's clear something special has happened. And
now, at last-
CUT TO
SOMETHING SPECIAL- and what it is, of course, is Patterson's first
view of the Africa of his imagination.
Because the desert has ended, and now there are grasses and trees
and one more thing-
-bursts of animals. On both sides of the train.
A flock of birds materializes here, a cluster of gazelles doing
there amazing leap there.
Patterson is like a kid in a candy store.
CUT TO
PATTERSON AND STARLING, back outside in the engine seat again.
Starling points-"|stage direction
96|STARLING|Aren't they amazing?|speech
97||"CUT TO
WHAT HE'S POINTING AT: Some giraffes running along, their absurd
shape suddenly graceful as they eat up the ground in incredibly
long strides.
CUT TO
PATTERSON AND STARLING, staring out."|stage direction
98|PATTERSON|"You know the most amazing thing
about them?- they only sleep five
minutes a day."|speech
99||"(Starling glances at him-
clearly, he didn't know that)"|location
100||"CUT TO
A FAMILY OF HYENAS. Close by, loping in their scary way."|stage direction
101|STARLING|Don't much like them.|speech
102||(nods)|location
103|PATTERSON|"The females are bigger- only animal
here like that- have to be or they
wouldn't survive because the males
eat the young."|speech
104||"CUT TO
STARLING studying Patterson. Clearly, he didn't know that, either.
CUT TO
SOME HIPPOS moving along. Starling turns to Patterson."|stage direction
105|STARLING|Anything special about them?|speech
106|PATTERSON|"Just that they fart through their
mouths."|speech
107||(beat)|location
108|PATTERSON|"Must make kissing something of a
gamble."|speech
109||(laughs)|location
110|STARLING|"I've lived in Africa a year and I
don't know what you know. How long
have you been here?"|speech
111||(looks at his watch)|location
112|PATTERSON|Almost three hours.|speech
113||(beat)|location
114|PATTERSON|"But I've been getting ready all my
life."|speech
115||(Now, from them-)|location
116||"CUT TO
A BUNCH OF IMPOVERISHED-LOOKING NATIVE WOMEN. They hold children
who wave at the passing train. The children are more impoverished
looking than their mothers."|stage direction
117||(suddenly touched)|location
118|STARLING|"Every time I see something like that,
I know we're right to be here- to
bring Christianity into their lives,
enrich their souls."|speech
119|PATTERSON|Beaumont says it's to end slavery.|speech
120||(shrugs)|location
121|STARLING|"We all have our reasons. Mine is
simply to make them understand
happiness, accept salvation, know the
serenity that comes-"|speech
122||(interrupts himself)|location
123|STARLING|"-best I stop. One of the by-products
of my belief is that I can become
amazingly boring. But I know God smiles
on me."|speech
124||(They really like each other)|location
125|PATTERSON|Have you got that in writing?|speech
126||"(Starling, amazingly good
natured, laughs. And now-)"|location
127||"CUT TO
A WHITE CLAW.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL
Hundreds of white claws.
KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL
They aren't claws at all, they're thorns as sharp as claws and
they're on a twenty-foot high thorn tree.
And there are dozens of those trees, packed together. All mixed in
with other trees, low and stunted, and thick underbrush and baked
red rocks-
-now the train begins to slow.
Smoke drifts across.
A bunch of wildebeest scatter off the tracks."|stage direction
128|STARLING (over)|Welcome to Tsavo.|speech
129||(on the word)|location
130||"CUT TO
TSAVO.
We have arrived at the train station area and what we see is a
place that is still being built. There are tin shacks; a water
tower is under construction-
-men are working everywhere, for that's what Tsavo is: a place for
work.
THE TRAIN goes slower still.
No one stands idly around here.
But no one looks happy either.
ONE MAN is apart from the rest: this is SAMUEL.
An ageless Masai, tall and slender, he has a smile that can light
the world.
CUT TO
PATTERSON AND STARLING as they step off the train."|stage direction
131||"(indicating Samuel,
who is approaching)"|location
132|STARLING|"Samuel is camp liaison- absolutely
indispensable- the only man here
everyone trusts."|speech
133||(softly)|location
134|PATTERSON|Does he speak English?|speech
135||(not softly enough)|location
136|SAMUEL|And very poor French.|speech

you."|speech

site?"|speech
144||(Samuel nods)|location

deliver. Come along to the hospital
when you're done."|speech
146||(starting off)|location
147|SAMUEL|I will bring him, Nigel.|speech
148||"We should realize by now that Samuel's was the voice we heard at
the very beginning of the picture.
CUT TO
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL, starting to walk. They pass the water tower.
Standing on top of it in a precarious position is an extremely
powerful INDIAN. He waves to Samuel who waves back. This is SINGH.
WORKERS study Patterson as he moves by. Not smiling. Up ahead,
some SIKHS are erecting tents. Not smiling."|stage direction
149|PATTERSON|Why do the workers look unhappy?|speech
150|SAMUEL|Because they are here.|speech
151||(beat)|location
152|SAMUEL|"Because Tsavo is the worst place in
the world."|speech
153||(He points ahead)|location
154|SAMUEL|Come, John- to the bridge.|speech
155||(And on that-)|location
156||"CUT TO
THE RAILROAD TRACKS as the camera pans along.
CUT TO
THE RIVER in the distance as they walk toward it.
And here is as good a place as any to explain just what the spot
where the movie takes place was like.
There were five hundred men working for Patterson. And they lived
in a spread out area. A bunch of Indian coolies who might have
come from the same town back in their country might choose to live
in one cluster of tents. A group of natives might be in another
cluster.
What we have then, as far as living places are concerned, are
dozens of clusters of tents. (Eventually, as the terror began,
these areas all got surrounded, each with its own thorn fence.)
The places we'll come to know best are, among others, Patterson's
living area, the hospital tent area, the area by the river where
the bridge is to be built, etc., etc.
As they move, Samuel points out various camps.
A SECT OF INDIANS is getting ready for prayer.
ANOTHER SECT OF INDIANS is eating.
A GROUP OF AFRICANS are cleaning their tent area.
Anyway, you get the idea. Just remember that the place covered a
wide expanse, maybe a mile square, maybe more.
Okay, back to the story."|stage direction
157||"(as they pass the INDIAN
tent area where prayer is
starting)"|location
158|PATTERSON|"It's all wonderfully under control,
Samuel- you've done a splendid job."|speech
159|SAMUEL|"Thank you. The truth is this: you
have to work at it constantly."|speech
160|PATTERSON|The workers don't get on?|speech
161|SAMUEL|"Get on? They detest each other.
Obviously the Africans hate the
Indians. But the Indians also hate
the other Indians. Some of them
worship cows, while others eat them."|speech
162||(As they move on)|location
163||"CUT TO
RAILROAD TRACK.
PAN ALONG TO
MORE RAILROAD TRACK.
KEEP PANNING
And suddenly the track just stops in mid-air as we
PULL BACK TO REVEAL
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL standing high above the Tsavo River. The
track has come to the edge of the area above the riverbank- where
it just stops-
-and picks up on the far side. All that's missing, in other words,
is the hundred-yard-long bridge that will connect the pieces of
track."|stage direction
164||(to the far side)|location
165|SAMUEL|Railhead is across there.|speech
166||"CUT TO
THE DISTANCE. Nothing can be made out clearly but there are great
clouds of dust."|stage direction
167|SAMUEL|"Three thousand men laying track- when
the bridge is done, it all joins up."|speech
168||"Patterson nods, says nothing, but goes to his haunches, staring at
the space where the bridge is to be."|stage direction
169|SAMUEL|Did it look like this in your mind?|speech
170||(shakes his head)|location
171|PATTERSON|This is more difficult-|speech
172||"CUT TO
PATTERSON. CLOSE UP. Excited."|stage direction
173||(eyes bright)|location
174|PATTERSON|"-but how wonderful that it's
difficult, it should be difficult-
what better job in all the world
than build a bridge?- make things
connect- bring worlds together- and
get it right!"|speech
175||(Now from Patterson-)|location
176||"CUT TO
THE HOSPITAL TENT
as Patterson and Samuel walk in. Patterson glances around-
-it's not bad at all. Of course there are some patients, injured
or with fever. But like the rest of the camp we've just seen,
everything is working well, everything is under control. Starling
approaches."|stage direction
177|STARLING|Finish your tour?|speech
178||(nods)|location
179|PATTERSON|And anxious to get started.|speech
180||(indicating the hospital)|location
181|PATTERSON|What is this, mostly malaria?|speech
182|STARLING|"Yes- but their suffering is only
transitory- once they except God
into their hearts, He will vanquish
all pain."|speech

poor bastards will relapse if you keep
on that way."|speech

the railroad?"|speech
196|HAWTHORNE|"This sham? Ridiculous. Who needs it?
It's only being built to control the
ivory trade, make men richer."|speech

PATTERSON'S TENT AREA
Starling has a tent there, too, as do Samuel and Hawthorne. And
there are half a dozen ORDERLIES.
Right now, Patterson is unpacking, moving in and out of his tent.
Starling, sipping tea, sits and watches."|stage direction

normal thing in the world. ""Ho-hum,
what lovely tea, I think I'll bag a
killer beast this evening, nothing
much else going on anyway."""|speech
223|PATTERSON|"Well, he put me in a spot, didn't he?
But that's all right- after all, I'm
responsible for everything that happens
here. And it certainly won't do much
for morale if a man-eater's on the prowl."|speech
224||"He goes into his tent with some books now and we go with him.
There is a photo of Helena on a small table. A photo of an ELDERLY
COUPLE, clearly his parents. His clothes are stacked with
precision. He arranges his books precisely too.
Clearly, John Patterson is a man who believes in order."|stage direction

donkey. Why ""of course""?"|speech
227||"(taking a rifle,
moving outside)"|location
228|PATTERSON|"We know three things about man-eaters.
First, they always return to where
they've attacked before. Second, they're
always old- they can't catch other
animals so they turn to us. And third,
they're always alone- they've been cast
out by their pride because they can't
keep up."|speech
229||"CUT TO
STARLING, sipping his tea and there's no hiding it, he's excited.
But also a bit reluctant."|stage direction

232|PATTERSON|Might be exciting for you.|speech

PULL BACK TO REVEAL
We're in a clearing with thick trees all around.
KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL

embankment will start. From here, there is a slope down to the

Also present is UNGAN SIGNH, who we saw earlier standing
precariously atop the water tower. Singh, enormously powerful, is
another assistant. Bright, a great worker, another main character
in what is to follow.
Now Patterson starts to walk down the slope towards the river-
it's not that easy to do without falling, but that doesn't bother
him. He talks and gestures as he explains to the other two who
move down with him.

CUT TO
WHAT HE'S STARING AT- the surrounding field of tall grass. Nothing
unusual about it.
CUT TO
PATTERSON. He stares, too.
CUT TO
THE FIELD OF TALL GRASS- suddenly it begins to bend and sway in a
fresh wind.
CUT TO
PATTERSON. Silent. As before. Starling follows his glance.
CUT TO
SINGH. Frozen.
CUT TO
THE FIELD. And now the field is making odd patterns- as if
something unseen were moving through.
CUT TO
PATTERSON. Quiet. Just the wind.
CUT TO
THE FIELD. Nothing visible. But the odd pattern seems to be making
its way across the field.
CUT TO
SINGH AND STARLING. Quiet. Just the wind.
CUT TO
THE FIELD. The odd pattern seems to stop. Around it, the wind
makes different shapes of the grass.
CUT TO
PATTERSON, as the wind continues to blow. He continues to stare at
the spot where the pattern stopped.
CUT TO
SINGH. As before. Except for one thing: suddenly, he begins to
shiver, as if from cold.
CUT TO
THE BUILDING SEQUENCE
And what we see are a lot of cuts of a lot of activity.
Huge wooden logs are carried in and hammered to each other and
driven deep into the ground- the framework for the embankments.
And Singh carries the heaviest loads and leads the workers- and as
the structure rises, he is the one darting along the top, high in
the air, pulling more logs up, helping here, helping there.
And alongside him is his assistant, ABDULLAH, a little man with
glasses and very bright eyes.
Meanwhile, Starling is leading construction on the embankment that
is on the far side of the river. And he does his best, tries to
help on the top part as it rises- but alas, he is a bit on the
clumsy side and balance is a problem for him. But he stays with
it, does well.
And Patterson, in tremendous spirits, helps when needed, but
mostly he is dealing with other aspects of the bridge- such as the
placements of the three stone foundation pillars-
-he wades into the water, climbs the structures, takes it all in-
and at the start he is still in the uniform he has worn since the
start of the story- but it's clumsy for labor-
-so he changes halfway through to civilian clothes-
-which is all he wears from now on.
And the workers tire in the heat- but Singh keeps them going,
working with the power of three-
-and there are accidents and explosions, injuries and falls- and
Hawthorne appears when needed to help with the wounded-
-it's hard, brutal work-
-but gradually, the wooden structure part is finished- two huge
skeletons facing each other across the Tsavo River- and now work
on the roadbed is going full blast and in the river, the three
foundation pillars are taking shape-
CUT TO
TONS OF RED ROCK- being shoved into the wooden skeleton to
complete the embankments. As this goes on-
CUT TO
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL in the river- the foundation pillar work is
going very quickly.
Patterson stops working, looks across the river-
-movement in the grassy area on the far side.
CUT TO
SEVERAL NANDI TRIBESMEN as they rise out of the grass, gesture to
Samuel who gestures back. The Nandi are a tribe of powerful little
men, primitive, with teeth that have been sharpened to points.

THE NANDI TRIBESMEN, staring at Patterson, shaking their heads.

THE TWO EMBANKMENTS, as more and more red rock is shoved and
pushed into shape.
CUT TO
THE THREE FOUNDATION PILLARS- almost finished.
CUT TO
THE ROADBED. The same.
CUT TO
THE NEAR EMBANKMENT as still more rock is forced in and
CUT TO
THE FAR EMBANKMENT done at last-
CUT TO
-and Singh stands on the top of the near one while across the
river, Patterson pulls Starling to the top of the other.
And they all look at each other- the embankments are both
finished- THE THREE OF THEM are flying-
-and what they do is this: hold their hands out toward each other,
in Singh's gesture. It's kind of become their password.
HOLD. A big moment for them all!
CUT TO
SINGH'S TENT AREA
He sits around a fire and the man is exhausted. His dinner plate
is beside him, untouched. He's too tired to eat.
CUT TO
PATTERSON'S TENT AREA
Starling is there, getting ready for bed. He's wiped out, too.
CUT TO
SINGH, going into his tent, lying down, breathing deep.
CUT TO
STARLING is in his tent, turning out his lamp, half asleep
already.
CUT TO
PATTERSON in his tent, closing his eyes.
CUT TO
SINGH, deep asleep in his tent-
-he shares it with a dozen others and they're all deep asleep.
They lie on the floor of the tent, heads together toward the
center pole, feet toward the edges of the tent.
HOLD ON SINGH. It's very dark. HE AND HIS MEN just lie motionless,
breathing deeply.
KEEP HOLDING.
Now the CAMERA moves up, high into the center of the tent, looking
down at the circle of men.
KEEP HOLDING.
They don't move, not even an inch. The steady breathing is the
only sound.
YES, KEEP HOLDING.
KEEP HOLDING.
Nothing is going on down there. Nothing at all.
KEEP HOLDING.
Not a goddamn thing.
KEEP ON HOLDING. KEEP ON HOLDING.
And now two things happen at the same time- Singh's eyes go wide-
-and he starts to slide out of the tent, as if being pulled by
some giant invisible wire-
CUT TO
SINGH. CLOSE UP. Screaming.
CUT TO
THE OTHER MEN IN THE TENT, waking, staring around and
CUT TO
SINGH as he slides out of the tent into the night and his screams
grow even louder as we
CUT TO
THE OTHER MEN IN THE TENT and it's like a bomb just went off, they
rise, spin, cry out, stare-
CUT TO
THE NIGHT OUTSIDE AND SINGH'S BODY sliding along the ground. It's
pitch black, and he's going head first now, face upwards and he's
going ast tremendous speed and whatever the hell it is that's
making this happen is something we can't make out- because it's so
dark and because it's on the far side of the man, and his body is
in our way and
CUT TO
UP AHEAD, some bushes and
CUT TO
SINGH, his body going faster than before and his cries are
weakening-
-CUT TO
THE NIGHT and his body and there is no sound at all coming from
him now and there is no sound from whatever it is that is making
this happen- all we see, barely, is the limp body of the big man
as it skims along and-
CUT TO
UP AHEAD NOW, a low clump of bushes.
CUT TO
SINGH'S BODY, coming closer and
CUT TO
THE BUSHES and as we get in on them we can tell they are thorn
bushes and now-
CUT TO
SINGH, suddenly rising magically in the night, his body flying
over the bushes and gone!
CUT TO
PATTERSON AND STARLING, early morning, their rifles held in front
of them, racing along, suddenly stopping, staring down and
CUT TO
THE GROUND. At first we can't make out much. Then we can- a spot
of red.
CUT TO
PATTERSON AND STARLING, hurrying on again.
CUT TO
THORN TREES, and as they force their way through them-
CUT TO
A LARGE VULTURE, wings spread wide as it floats slowly to earth-
-HOLD-
-as it lands we can see A DOZEN OTHER VULTURES are already there,
surrounding something-
-but we can't make it out. We are in an area of grass and shadow-
-and specks of blood.

forward.

PATTERSON, catching Starling, leading him into the TSAVO STATION
area, Samuel just behind them.
CUT TO
A RECTANGULAR SHED, ahead of them. They move to it, slow-

Patterson glances at Starling- the sound could be this: the
crunching of bones.
CUT TO
PATTERSON, checking his rifle.
CUT TO
STARLING, doing the same. Samuel, holding the extra ammunition,
moves close to Patterson. Now-
CUT TO
PATTERSON as he suddenly steps away from the shed, rounding the
corner and as he does-
CUT TO
THE WHITE LION, with the Fat Coolie- the lion is crunching at his
feet-
-then the lion stares toward the shed as we
CUT TO
PATTERSON, moving out into clearer view, Starling and Samuel right
with him. THE LION is a good distance away.
CUT TO
THE WHITE LION, a low growl coming from him as he takes the
coolie's body by the shoulder, begins backing away with it.
CUT TO
PATTERSON, dropping to his knees for the shot and
CUT TO
STARLING, doing the same and
CUT TO
THE WHITE LION, growling louder and
CUT TO
PATTERSON, taking aim and
CUT TO
SAMUEL, crying out and pointing and suddenly we're into super slow
motion-
-Samuel has pointed back toward the roof of the shed and-
-and this thing is suddenly there-

flat roof of the shed and

THE SUN, blocked out as this dark thing moves across it, fully
stretched, it seems to go on forever and

THE WHITE MANED LION roaring and

THE BLACK MANED LION roaring, running to the other and

THE TWO LIONS IN CLOSE UP.
THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS, for that is how they will be referred
to-
-and The Ghost has blood and bits of flesh on its mouth-
-The Darkness has eyes that are crazed-
-they are destruction bringers, these two, they can kill the old
and the young and the fat and the strong-
CUT TO
PATTERSON, lying in pain, dazed, shoulder bleeding, trying to
reach for his rifle and
CUT TO
THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS, the white and the black, as they move
toward the field of tall grass, roaring and
CUT TO
SAMUEL, lying in pain, his leg is bleeding and
CUT TO
PATTERSON'S RIFLE and
CUT TO
PATTERSON, as he reaches it, manages to lift it and the roaring
sounds are deafening now and
CUT TO
THE TWO GIGANTIC MALES, backing into the tall grass-
-they roar one final time-
CUT TO
PATTERSON, gun ready to fire but it's futile and he knows it as we
CUT TO
THE TALL GRASS and they're gone, the grass is full of moving
patterns from the wind- that's all we see- just the grass blowing
this way, that way-

incredible, just incredible but Patterson's idea actually worked

In one half, the huge lion. In the other, the three armed, tough
coolies.

bars-

the other way and

you couldn't tell that from what they're doing-

sunlight. He raises Hawthorne's gun.

CUT TO
REDBEARD. Stalking the perimeter. No sound. The night is deadly
quiet.
CUT TO
PATTERSON. He stalks the perimeter now too, on the far side from
Redbeard- and suddenly a different and frightening sound- the
ripping of flesh-
CAMERA MOVES UP
Now we can see both Patterson inside and also outside where, in
shadow, The Ghost and The Darkness are devouring a hunk of meat.
Redbeard moves quickly across the perimeter, gestures for
Patterson to switch positions with him.
As he reaches where Patterson was, the eating sound stops.
Silence again.
Patterson reaches the far side of the fence.
Now the eating sound comes again, and again, BOTH LIONS are
outside, directly across from Patterson.
CUT TO
REDBEARD looks across the perimeter at Patterson. Whatever's going
on, it's sure as hell odd.
CUT TO
THE CATTLE- they are very upset suddenly- one of them kicks out
violently against the night- the same gesture the cattle did just
before The Ghost walked through their pen and killed one-
-now a different sound is heard: scratching-
CUT TO
PATTERSON AND REDBEARD tracking the sound-
-the main gate is starting to be pushed in. Inside the gate the
ground is covered with blood stains from where they emptied their
buckets.
CUT TO
THE GATE. More pressure against it- it could give way any moment.
CUT TO
REDBEARD AND PATTERSON and from the look on Redbeard's face, this
is it! Patterson seees this, readies his rifle and we-
CUT TO
THE CATTLE, going nuts and then-
CUT TO
THE GATE. All pressure gone.
CUT TO
PATTERSON AND REDBEARD. Patterson is furious."|stage direction

device myself once."|speech
803|PATTERSON|But of course yours worked.|speech
804|REDBEARD|"In point of fact it didn't- but I'm
convinced the idea is sound."|speech
805||"He goes back to walking the perimeter. Patterson watches him- and
for the first time since the misfire, Patterson's mood begins to
lift.
CUT TO
THE NEW HOSPITAL
and an ORDERLY, blood pouring from his throat as he lies by the
fire and
CUT TO
THE SECOND ORDERLY rounding a corner, seeing the violence; before
he can scream-
CUT TO
THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS suddenly beside him, and their giant
paws slap out so fast we can't follow and
CUT TO
THE SECOND ORDERLY, dropping to the ground, and now we're starting
to spin into madness and these next cuts go like lightning.
CUT TO
A TENT FULL OF SICK MEN with malaria and
CUT TO
A PAW flashing and
CUT TO
THE DARKNESS, lips pulling back and
CUT TO
A SICK MAN, falling from his bed, blood pouring from his slashed
face and
CUT TO
TWO MORE SICK MEN, trying to rise and
CUT TO
THE GHOST, leaping on them and
CUT TO
THE DARKNESS, eyes narrow and brilliant and
CUT TO
A SICK COOLIE, and he's terrified and he tries to scream-
-the sound barely escapes him, but even so, it's the first cry
we've heard and
CUT TO
THE ENTIRE CAMP, NIGHT, WITH ALL THE FIRES BURNING- AND
PATTERSON'S TENT AREA IS CLOSE BY-
-but the New Hospital is on the other end, a good distance away.
CUT TO
PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, rifles ready- but no sound reaches them.
CUT TO
HAWTHORNE, out of his tent, because he's close by and he heard it
and he lights a torch, starts for the gate of the camp as Samuel
does his best to stop him-
-but Hawthorne rips free and we
CUT TO
A SECOND TENT, as it starts to collapse and
CUT TO
THE MEDICINE TENT, as The Ghost and The Darkness enter and
CUT TO
MEDICINE, flying across the tent and
CUT TO
GLASS, shattering and more medicine is destroyed and
CUT TO
A BLIZZARD OF CUTS, of lions' claws and lions' teeth and those
terrible bright blazing eyes and
CUT TO
A TENT POLE, being pulled out of the ground and
CUT TO
THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS and what they are doing is this:
destroying the New Hospital and
CUT TO
MORE TENTS collapsing and
CUT TO
THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS. CLOSE UP. Eyes crazed.
CUT TO
HAWTHORNE ALONE IN THE NIGHT, scared shitless as he runs.
CUT TO
SHADOWS, moving, as Hawthorne's torch lights the surroundings and
CUT TO
HAWTHORNE, heart pounding, looking around and then he gasps as we
CUT TO
THE AREA NEARBY- TWO LARGE EYES are staring at him.
CUT TO
HAWTHORNE, panicked, stumbling, falling, getting up, staring
around-
CUT TO
THE AREA AROUND HIM- the eys are gone-
-and now there are loud shrieks in the night coming from the New
Hospital and the instant they are heard
CUT TO
REDBEARD AND PATTERSON, grabbing torches, throwing the gate open
and they're off as we
CUT TO
HAWTHORNE, running toward the New Hospital just up ahead now.
CUT TO
PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, tearing through the night.
CUT TO
THE NEW HOSPITAL. (We see all this next through Hawthorne's eyes.)
The tents are all down. The place is devastated.
CUT TO
INSIDE THE FIRST TENT. Filled with the dead and the dying.
CUT TO
HAWTHORNE. Ashen. Moving on.
CUT TO
PAN ALONG THE TENT
Dead. Blood. Pain.
PAN TO THE SECOND TENT
More dead.
More dying.
It's a slaughterhouse.
CUT TO
HAWTHORNE. He's crushed. His body sags. He takes a breath, his
last.
THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS are on him, roaring.
CUT TO
PATTERSON AND REDBEARD as the roar reverberates- they glance at
each other-
-then they slow.
Because the New Hospital has come into view.
CUT TO
REDBEARD, CLOSE UP, staring at the disaster.
And this terrible crosses his face. For a moment, you think he's
going to fall. His body seems drained of all its power. He stands
there. Just stands there. Unable to move.
CUT TO
PATTERSON. And he does move. Slowly. Carefully. Into the chaos.
He stares around- the dead and the dying are everywhere.
Hawthorne, his face clawed almost unrecognizably, lies alone.
All that's left now is this: the sound of pain.
HOLD.
Dust rises. It covers everything. Only the sound remains.
Now different sounds take over-
-an incredible babble of human voices.
AND A RAILROAD TRAIN.
Patterson walks through the dust. Samuel, a worried look on his
face, is a few steps behind.
We are at the STATION AREA and it is jammed. A train has pulled
into the station-
-only you almost can't tell it's a train: all you can see are
workers climbing up, and the inside is full so the workers clamber
up onto the roofs of the cars-
-covering the cars-
-everyone is leaving-
-Patterson can only watch.
Abdullah stands on one of the cars-
-the train begins to pull out of the station.
More and more workers chase after it, get pulled on.
Now the station area is empty, the flat car roofs full.
Patterson still watches, eyes vacant.
Abdullah sees him, looks away.
The train gathers speed.
Rounds a corner...
...gone...
Patterson turns from the scene, begins to walk. Samuel stays close
behind him, the worried look still there.
CUT TO
THE OLD HOSPITAL.
A FEW AFRICAN ORDERLIES do the best they can. Patterson watches
only a moment, walks on. Samuel still behind him.
CUT TO
THE CAMP as Patterson walks through. A ghost town now. Only
Africans remain.
CUT TO
THE CONTRAPTION where the coolies missed The Darkness. Patterson
looks at it a moment, walks on.
CUT TO
THE ANTHILL IN THE CLEARING where Patterson misfired. Patterson
looks at it a moment, walks on. And now, at last-
CUT TO
PATTERSON'S TENT AREA. One or two Africans. Samuel darts into his
tent, emerges with something, holds it out to Patterson.
IT'S A NECKLACE OF LION CLAWS.
Patterson makes an almost courtly bow of thanks, puts it on- he
never takes it off again. He walks on alone now until at last-
CUT TO
THE BRIDGE.
It stops abruptly, halfway done; the foundations are in place, a
lot of the scaffolding, but it's useless. Late afternoon.
Desolate.
Redbeard sits alone, high on one of the foundations. He looks as
he did the night before.
Patterson walks to the top of the near embankment. He is unshaven,
wrinkled, he fingers the lion claw necklace.
For a moment, neither says a word. Then-"|stage direction

817||"CUT TO
A LONG SHOT OF A HIGH ROCKY CLIFF-
-we haven't seen anything like it before- it's hundreds of feet
tall- gorgeous early morning light.
As we watch, we realize there are two dots on the side of the
cliff.
As we watch a moment more, we realize the dots are moving.
CAMERA MOVES CLOSER.
THE DOTS are Patterson and Redbeard, working their way along the
rock face. Patterson is much more nimble. It's dangerous, of
course, but neither of them seems to have that uppermost in mind.
They travel lightly- small knapsacks and their weapons.
CUT TO
THE TWO OF THEM as they make it over the cliff face. They stand,
stare out.
CUT TO
WHAT THEY SEE: the world. They move on.
CUT TO
A RAVINE. They are moving along the edge. It's tricky going- if
you fell you wouldn't much like it. They are both concentrating on
their movements, paying no attention to each other as Redbeard
starts to speak. They don't stop moving."|stage direction

PATTERSON AND REDBEARD working their way up a steep ravine. It's
hard going. They help each other.
CUT TO
PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving along the edge of the ravine now.
Slow. Silent. Redbeard stops, points-
CUT TO
A TANGLE IN THE BUSHES AND THORNS with one odd thing about it:
there is a clearly defined archway, as if a buffalo or rhino used
it as a regular passage.
CUT TO
THE TWO OF THEM at the archway. They look at each other, without a
word move through it.
CUT TO
THE OTHER SIDE. A small clearing. And at the end of the clearing:
a cave.
CUT TO
THE CAVE MOUTH. Dark.
CUT TO
REDBEARD AND PATTERSON. They each check their guns, move toward
it.
CUT TO
THE CAVE MOUTH. Closer. Suddenly it's getting eerie.
CUT TO
REDBEARD, moving slowly, Patterson right with him.
CUT TO
THE CAVE MOUTH. They're by it- Redbeard squints inside.
CUT TO
WHAT HE SEES: it's dark and dangerous and there is a long low
tunnel you have to half-crawl through.
Without a word, they start inside.
CUT TO
REDBEARD AND PATTERSON, crouched low, moving through the tunnel.
Ahead there is light. They move on.
CUT TO
THE END OF THE TUNNEL- they can see the cave beyond.
CUT TO
REDBEARD AND PATTERSON. They glance down. Nothing much there- just
a copper bracelet, the kind a native might wear.
Now they move past it and as the tunnel ends, they stand up.
CUT TO
INSIDE THE CAVE - IT'S BIG.
CUT TO
PATTERSON AND REDBEARD, moving deeper into the cave. It's scary-
dark with shafts of light coming from cracks in the rock. It's
dank. It all feels as at any moment, the world could end.

THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING, a good distance away. A bunch of trees.
Nothing unusual.
MOVE IN CLOSER:
Redbeard, motionless, rifle in hand, is high in the branches.

PATTERSON, trying to get comfortable. It's not possible.

THE DONKEY, tethered, but able to move.

PATTERSON, testing the machan- not a good idea- it trembles. He
stops, stares out at the setting sun, the light hitting his skin,
giving it color.

THE SUN and here's the thing about Africa- the sun doesn't just
set, it literally drops out of the sky. Suddenly it's bright and
in a blink it isn't. As it drops-

it. And that shows.
CUT TO
THE SKY. No moon. Just thick cloud.
CUT TO
THE DONKEY. Quiet.
CUT TO
PATTERSON. On his precarious perch. He scans constantly ahead of
him past the donkey.

THE THICK BUSH BEYOND THE DONKEY. Nothing moves-

PATTERSON. He swallows, moistening his throat. He stares down at
the donkey.
CUT TO
THE DONKEY. LATER. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. DARK.
And now, just the beginning of a mist.
CUT TO
THE SKY. THICKER AND THICKER CLOUDS. LATER STILL. GETTING TOWARD
MORNING.
CUT TO
PATTERSON sitting there twelve feet up as the silence extends,
listening for something, anything-
-but all there is is silence.
CUT TO
THE DONKEY. It lies still and quiet.
CUT TO
PATTERSON, looking around- you get the feeling he'd like to
scream.
CUT TO
THE BUSHES AROUND HIM. The mist is getting stronger.
CUT TO
REDBEARD in his tree, cursing, trying to see through the growing
mist.
CUT TO
PATTERSON, listening, listening-
-and then there is a sound and it's so quiet you can barely hear
it but to Patterson it might as well be thunder-
-from behind the donkey there has come this: the snapping of a
twig.
CUT TO
THE DONKEY, and it's eyes widen-
HOLD ON THE DONKEY.
Because now something happens that hasn't happened before:
suddenly there are no colors, only tones-
-because lions can't see colors, only tones, and that's what's
happening- we are looking at the donkey from the point of view of
the lion-
PULL BACK TO REVEAL
THE EYES OF THE GHOST. Watching the donkey.
And from now on, when we are using PATTERSON'S POINT OF VIEW,
everything is clouded and thick with mist, and sounds are muted.
When we are using THE GHOST'S POINT OF VIEW, everything is totally
clear- and sounds are thunderous.
CUT TO
WHAT PATTERSON SEES: just mist and vaguely, bushes.
CUT TO
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: The donkey. And CAMERA begins to move closer
as The Ghost moves, just the barest few steps closer.
CUT TO
PATTERSON. Still no sound- but beyond the donkey there seems to be
some movement in the bushes.
CUT TO
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: The donkey, very, very close-
CUT TO
PATTERSON. Squinting desperately at the area beyond the donkey but
the mist is so thick, he can't make certain of anything.
CUT TO
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: THE DONKEY.
HOLD.
Now there is something else visible, something behind the donkey:
the four legs of the platform.
HOLD.
Now we travel up the platform- the four legs grow closer together.
HOLD AS THE GHOST AT LAST SEES PATTERSON.
CUT TO
THE EYES OF THE GHOST. NARROWING.
CUT TO
PATTERSON. Involuntarily, a shiver.
CUT TO
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, but the angle shifts-
-what's happening of course is this: The Ghost is circling around
the platform in the safety of the bushes and the mist.
CUT TO
PATTERSON, following the whispered sound of the bushes moving. He
half turns the other way quickly, making sure that nothing is
behind him.
CUT TO
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON shifting as the angle continues to
change.
CUT TO
PATTERSON as the realization hits: the beast doesn't care about
the donkey anymore, it's stalking him.
CUT TO
REDBEARD. In the tree. The mist obscures everything.
CUT TO
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Still circling, still closer.
CUT TO
PATTERSON, and it's scary now, this thing circling and circling,
always closer, never visible and his throat is dry and you know
he's just dying to blast it with his weapon or scream for it to do
anything but this constantly circling movement. (In truth, the
lion circled him for two hours, always coming closer, never quite
seen.)
CUT TO
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, always the circling around.
CUT TO
PATTERSON, trying to turn on his shaky plank, trying to never to
let the animal's position out of his sight.
CUT TO
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer...
CUT TO
PATTERSON, staring, staring at the goddamn mist, about to come
apart now with the tension as it builds and builds and builds and
CUT TO
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer.
CUT TO
PATTERSON, gripping his weapon tightly as his head keeps on
turning.
CUT TO
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON. Closer.
CUT TO
PATTERSON, suddenly yelling out loud as an owl lands on him-
that's right, a goddamn owl landed on him, thinking he was a tree,
almost knocking him off the plank and
CUT TO
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, starting to slip off the platform
and
CUT TO
PATTERSON, fighting the owl away, but his balance is going and
he's trying not to fall and
CUT TO
WHAT THE GHOST SEES: PATTERSON, beginning to topple off and
CUT TO
PATTERSON, helpless, balance going, going-
CUT TO
THE GHOST, starting to charge forward and Christ he can move and
as he starts his leap-

REDBEARD, racing from the tree to the edge of the clearing, firing
his rifle, firing again and
CUT TO
THE GHOST, as this incredible roar comes from him, and he spins,
lands, and sure, he's been hit but he's gone, back into the bushes
and the night has him and

STRANGE TERRAIN- huge anthills all over, the tallest we've seen,
some of them fifteen feet high, some even higher.

REDBEARD. He gestures for them to stop. They do. For a moment they

CUT TO
THE ROCKY GROUND. Spots of blood. Redbeard kneels to examine them
and as he does-
CUT TO
THE GHOST, launched in mid-air and
CUT TO
PATTERSON, whirling, falling, firing and as the sound detonates-
CUT TO
THE GHOST, in mid-air, body twisted and-

Freeze on The Ghost silhouetted against the morning sky.
HOLD. THen-

SAMUEL, WALKING INTO THE SHOT-
-we're by the river and this is a repeat of the earlier moment
when the three men brought the old man-eater into camp-

actual number of men that it took, and as they lower the dead
animal to the ground-
CUT TO
THE GHOST- and now there's a flash of light as we
PULL BACK TO REVEAL
BEAUMONT, kneeling by the dead animal. He is smiling beautifully,
and there is no questioning the look of triumph on his face.

humiliated, and as the laughter builds-

THE TENT AREA. NIGHT.
Patterson and Redbeard flank a fire. It's a sweet moment for them,
their first, no fear in the vicinity.
It should be noted that they both are drinking from bottles of
champagne.
It should also be noted that the Patterson we see is a world away
from the young man who went to meet Beaumont. He's unshaven, his
eyes have seen terrible things, he is weary, he has known failure-

PATTERSON AT THE BRIDGE- Samuel hurries to him with the news-
Patterson takes off running and
CUT TO
TSAVO STATION and Helena; she holds the sleeping child, walks back
and forth along the shaded front of the building, no sound at all
but her heels.
CUT TO
PATTERSON, running like crazy and up ahead now is the station
area.
CUT TO
HELENA- and now, in the distance, she sees him and she leaves the
building, walks out into the open, smiling and waving excitedly
and

PATTERSON, excitedly waving back and

THE DARKNESS, moving out of the grassy area behind Helena and

PATTERSON, suddenly screaming ""Get back- back-""

HELENA, and she's too far away- his words are lost on the wind-
she smiles again, waves again and

PATTERSON, screaming now, all he has, ""GET BACK"" and

HELENA, and she still can't make out what he's saying but just the
same, she stops and

THE DARKNESS, stalking silently, closing on the mother and child.

HELENA, and the baby wakes, smiles and

PATTERSON and now it shows on his face- he's not going to get

turns-

THE DARKNESS, leaping on them, taking them to the ground and as
Helena cries out helplessly-
CUT TO
PATTERSON, crying out helplessly and
PULL BACK TO REVEAL
PATTERSON IN HIS TENT,
continuing to cry out until he realized the nightmare he just had
is over-
-he staggers to his tent opening, goes outside.
CUT TO
OUTSIDE. It's dawn. Patterson, shaken, tries to rid himself of the
dream. He looks around.
Redbeard's tent is ripped- Patterson runs to it-
CUT TO
INSIDE THE TENT. It's empty. Patterson stares around-
-there is blood on the tent floor and quickly-
CUT TO
THE SUN. RISING.
CUT TO
PATTERSON running wildly, rifle in hand and
CUT TO
SAMUEL, carrying a weapon, hurrying to keep up and
CUT TO
PATTERSON, flying across rough terrain and as he and Samuel splash
across a small river, he gestures for them to split and they do,
widening the area of search and
CUT TO
SAMUEL, veering off and
CUT TO
THORN TREES, as Patterson rips through them, unmindful of the
damage to his clothes or his skin and
CUT TO
MORE THORNS- he plunges wildly ahead and
CUT TO
A LARGE ANTHILL- it seems to be casting an unusual shadow-
Patterson slows, rifle ready, takes a breath, moves around it-
-nothing at all- just his imagination which has been working
overtime and is only getting worse-
Patterson stands there a moment, unsure where to go, what to do-
-and then SAMUEL'S VOICE on the wind- calling to him-
CUT TO
PATTERSON, tracking the sound- Samuel's voice cries out again,
louder-
-Patterson starts to run and run, and as he rounds a bend-
CUT TO
A FIELD OF WHITE GRASS. So lovely.
With one patch in the middle that is blood red.
Something is moving in the blood red area.
Patterson has his rifle ready-
-and then Samuel rises from the blood red patch.
CUT TO
SAMUEL. In shock, in despair, call it what you want- he has seen
something beyond imagination.
CUT TO
PATTERSON, rushing across the field of white grass, rushing to
where Samuel stands in the patch of blood red grass- he looks down
into the grass-
-clearly, Redbeard is there and clearly he is dead. Patterson and
Samuel stare mute at one another-
-and now, from frighteningly near them, comes the triumphant roar
of The Darkness. They don't even react.
CUT TO
FLAMES RISING IN THE LATE AFTERNOON.
We should already have a sense of where we are; we've done this
before.
START PULLING BACK.
Samuel stands there, trying to hold it together.
KEEP PULLING BACK.
Patterson stands there too, trying to hold it together.
KEEP PULLING BACK TO REVEAL
REDBEARD'S FUNERAL PYRE. Flames consume the body.
Just Patterson and Samuel. No one else is there.
The flames lick at the sky...
HOLD...
CUT TO
A LARGE BABOON. ONE LEG IS TIED TO THE END OF THE BRIDGE. GETTING
DARK NOW.

fifteen feet from the baboon.
They help each other into position. Almost night.
CUT TO
THE LARGE BABOON, baring its enormous teeth, shrieking out into
the darkness.
CUT TO
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL on the platform. Samuel tosses a pebble
toward the baboon and the baboon cries out again, not in pain but
irritation-
CUT TO
THE PLATFORM. PATTERSON AND SAMUEL ARE FLOODED BY MOONLIGHT. IT'S
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
They're both tired. Samuel throws another pebble. The baboon cries
out.
CUT TO
PATTERSON, TENSE, ON THE PLATFORM. MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.
He's tossing pebbles now as Samuel dozes. Paterson looks wild;
only nervous energy is keeping him going now.
CUT TO
THE SKY. The moon. Peaceful- then it turns bright yellow and
frightening black clouds gather and
CUT TO
PATTERSON, blinking, coming hard back to reality because the sky
is not yellow nor were there black clouds- he's starting to
hallucinate.
CUT TO
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL ON THE PLATFORM.
Samuel is awake now. Patterson stares at the river which is calm.
CUT TO
THE RIVER, raging and black and lethal.

PATTERSON, hallucinating again.

toward the shrieking baboon and the instant it appears-

PATTERSON. Firing-

WHERE HE'S POINTING. The superstructure for the bridge- it goes
several levels beneath the level where the railroad will run.
They look at each other- not good news and we find out why when we
CUT TO
EARLY MORNING LIGHT.
Patterson and Samuel climb carefully down from their platform to
the railroad level. They reach the railroad level. PAtterson
releases the baboon which races away.
CUT TO
WHERE THEY ARE. At the end of the bridge where they began
construction. The bridge, two thirds finished, stretches away
before them.
CUT TO
They begin to walk the incomplete bridge... carefully...
..as they go the look down through the crevices of their level,
making sure they miss nothing.
CUT TO
SAMUEL. Terrified. Holding his rifle extremely tightly.
CUT TO
PATTERSON. Ready for anything.
CUT TO
THE BRIDGE up ahead of them. There are some holes.
CUT TO
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL slowing.
CUT TO
THE HOLES. The nearest one is the largest.
CUT TO
PATTERSON. He goes on tiptoe, trying to see what's in the hole.
CUT TO
THE HOLE. It seems empty.
CUT TO
PATTERSON AND SAMUEL. One step forward. Another. They hold their
breaths.
CUT TO
THE HOLE. It seems empty.
CUT TO
A SHOT FROM BELOW BRIDGE LEVEL- The Darkness is there.

THE DARKNESS, going down through another level of scaffolding.

PATTRSON AND SAMUEL, trying to track it.

CUT TO
THE HOLE. Nothing.
CUT TO
THE FIRST LEVEL of scaffolding. Nothing.
CUT TO
THE SECOND LEVEL of scaffolding. Nothing.

SAMUEL, looking this way, that way.
SHOCK CUT TO
THE HOLE AS THE DARKNESS JUST FUCKING FLIES OUT OF IT- Patterson
falls back and fires and The Darkness is hit and goes down but it
gets up and

PATTERSON, turning for Samuel's rifle-
-only Samuel isn't there-
-he's taken off for the trees at the end of the bridge and
CUT TO
THE DARKNESS ROARING AND
CUT TO
PATTERSON and he turns, starts running too, running across the
narrow half-completed bridge and it's a bitch to do it without
slipping or falling and
CUT TO
THE DARKNESS, wounded, sure, but the mother can still run and it
takes off after Patterson and
CUT TO
SAMUEL, making it to the end of the bridge and jumping for the
nearest tree and
CUT TO
PATTERSON running for his life across the bridge and
CUT TO
THE DARKNESS, closing the gap and ordinarily Patterson would be a
dead man but even though The Darkness hasn't got its ordinary
speed, it's still faster than Patterson and

PATTERSON, and he's never gone this fast in his life and

THE TREE HE'S HEADED FOR, a different one from Samuel's and it's
just up ahead and

THE TREE, and

PATTERSON, diving for the lowest branch, grabbing hold with both
hands, swinging his body up as we

THE DARKNESS, barely missing as Patterson gets his body onto the
branch and now comes this insane roar and

SAMUEL with his rifle, as he climbs higher into his tree.

PATTERSON in the next tree, climbing higher, until he's fifteen
feet up.
CUT TO
THE DARKNESS, on the ground, circling the trunk of Patterson's
tree, raging with frustration.

is a four hundred pound thing rocking it now and

lot of choices in this world and

It roars and roars and moves slowly toward Patterson.
CUT TO
PATTERSON; all bullets gone, no place to hide.
CUT TO
THE DARKNESS. Still moving forward.
CUT TO
PATTERSON. He takes a step backward, falls backwards over a
branch, lands hard and
CUT TO
THE DARKNESS, framed between Patterson's legs. Six feet away, now
four, now-
CUT TO
PATTERSON, helpless on the ground.
CUT TO
THE DARKNESS, and the eyes glow-
-a branch is on the ground in front of it- it buries its huge
teeth into the branch-
-now a long dying sigh... and it goes to the ground.
CUT TO
PATTERSON. Can't breathe.
CUT TO
THE DARKNESS, dead, its teeth still buried in the tree branch.
CUT TO
PATTERSON. CLOSE UP. And suddenly he just empties and tears pour
down his face and he begins to cry out loud, his body wracked with
sobs. He manages to get to his knees, moves next to the animal-
CUT TO
PATTERSON AND THE DARKNESS. Just the sound of Patterson's tears...
