ROUGH DRAFT
1    A MULTI-COLORED SCREEN                                      1
After a few introductory credits, we pull back to reveal the
source of this kaleidoscopic backdrop: A SINGLE, STRIPED
TULIP, planted in a long row of other tulips. A HAND reaches
in and pulls the tulip from the ground. We then cut to:
1A   A BASKET of tulips, carried by hand to a truck, where it    1A
is loaded with hundreds of other baskets. The door of the
truck is SHUT and we cut to:
1B   The door of the truck OPENING to reveal that the tulips    1B
are now boxed and crated. A forklift moves the crates onto a
wagon, which is driven by a MANNED CART across the biggest
warehouse on the planet, the Bloenen Markt (CHECK THIS--
steven) in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The cart and wagons we
were following disappear into a maze of synchronized
activity.
1C   The cart arrives in the AUCTION ROOM, which is             1C
constructed like an ampitheater: the buyers sit in a steeply
raked semi-circle, facing two giant, clock-shaped scoreboards
that display the bids on the flowers being viewed. The
striped tulips fetch a very high price.
1D   The carts of striped tulips are delivered to an automated 1D
sorting apparatus of enormous size and complexity. They end
up on a truck heading for the airport.
1E   The tulips are loaded onto a plane. During the transatlantic
flight, they sit nestled in the cargo hold.
1F   The tulips are unloaded from the plane, driven across an    1F
airport tarmac and loaded onto another plane.
1G   The tulips are unloaded from the plane and loaded onto a   1G
truck. The truck drives through a small town and pulls into
the back of a
2    EXT./INT. FLOWER SHOP -- DAY                                2
A YOUNG MAN takes delivery of the flowers and carries them
through the rear of the store to the display area up front.
We stay on the tulips as we hear the following conversation:

OWNER
It's an accident. It means the
flower developed a virus early
in the bulb stage. The flaws
create the unusual coloring.
CUSTOMER
Can you arrange something for me
with those?
OWNER
Of course. What kind of price range
are you looking for?
Now we SEE the customer: TESS.
TESS
Well, it's for my parent's
anniversary. They don't know I'm
coming. I just want it to be
beautiful. Can you just do whatever
you think looks best?
OWNER
I'll need a few minutes.
TESS
Take your time, please. And thank
you.
The Owner moves toward a corner of the store where the
flowers are arranged. Tess walks around, looking at the rest
of the store.
Tess looks out the window. A black sedan is pulling up at the
curb.
OWNER
That should be some surprise.
TESS
Which?
OWNER
For your parents.
TESS
Oh. Yes. I hope so.
One of the POWER TWINS gets out of the driver's side door and
crosses in front of the car. Tess starts moving away from the
window.

Which one is it?
TESS
I'm sorry?
OWNER
Anniversary.
TESS
Oh. Fortieth
OWNER
Wow. Okay. I think I have an idea.
Something classic.
The Power Twin opens the rear passenger side door, revealing
TERRY BENEDICT.
Tess turns away from the window.
TESS
Do you have a bathroom?
OWNER
Straight back, on the left. It's
unisex.
TESS
Thank you.
Tess scurries to the back.
OWNER
(to Tess, a caveat)
It's unisex!
Tess flies past the bathroom and heads for the back door. She
pushes through it and runs right into Power Twin No. 2.

Danny Ocean picks up the receiver, checks the caller ID. He
smiles and answers:
DANNY
Miguel Diaz speaking.
Almost immediately, his expression clouds. He looks at his
watch.
DANNY (cont'd)
Tess, Tess. It's okay. You remember
what we talked about, if this
happened? All right. Call me in
twenty-four hours on that number.
He hangs up the phone and runs out of the house. He doesn't
take anything with him.
5   EXT. HOUSE -- DAY                                             5
Danny runs out of the house and down the street, leaving his
car in the driveway.

Tess, floral arrangement in her lap, sits in the car with
Benedict.
BENEDICT
The Baldwins.
TESS
What about them?
BENEDICT
We had dinner with them three years

anniversary.
She says nothing.
BENEDICT (cont'd)
I'm getting married next month.
TESS
So am I.

Yen swims a strong, steady freestyle. Pull back to reveal
that he is swimming in a 9' by 5' ""Endless Pool"" in his 15th

A HAND MOVES INTO FRAME and turns off the water current. Yen
immediately slams into the end of his jacuzzi-sized pool. He
lifts his head out of the water to SEE the POWER TWINS
standing ""poolside.""
He spits out a stream of invective, in Chinese. The Power
Twins look at each other.

his ear.
VIRGIL

Virgil stands up. Benedict and the Power Twins are standing

the mirror.

FIND RUSTY as he painstakingly works on a new piece that is
just BELOW FRAME. Whatever it is, it is clearly getting to
him. He shakes his head; it's not right. It's just not good

the cask of molten metal. It reads: 736.18 degrees.

A bolt flies through Vanderspeigle's open window and hits the
wall above the alarm pad. Two thin wires are attached to a
tiny wheel, which is attached to the back of the bolt. The
wires run back to the window of the apartment across the
canal.
Inside that apartment: the wires end in another tiny wheel

the number pad of Vanderspeigle's keypad to the ""clothesline""

Livingston's device is shuttled across the canal, through
Vanderspeigle's cracked window and right to the alarm panel.
Magnets on the side of the device cause it to snap into place
over the top of the keypad.   Livingston then types a six-
digit code into a remote keypad. His keypunches are mimicked
by the remote device. Vanderspeigle's alarm shuts off.
Downstairs: From inside we see the front door lock picked.
The door swings open.

Danny and Rusty come through the front door. They are
followed by Linus. All of them are soaking wet from 24 hours
in the swamp under the house, and the last few minutes in the
pouring rain outside the front door. The group silently
slips up the stairs.
ISABEL (V.O.)
Oh, I wish I could've have seen
that.

They enter Vanderspeigle's office. You can hear him snoring
in the other room. Danny and Rusty quickly, carefully remove
the crossbow bolt from the wall and take it to the window.
They drop it (and the attached wires) to the Malloys, who are
waiting on the street below.
Meanwhile Linus spackles the hole in the wall and paints over
the spackle.
Danny and Rusty turn to see that Linus is finished. They
hand-signal each other like Special Forces guys do, then move
towards the bookcase on the adjacent wall.
ISABEL (V.O.)
That must have really been
something.
Suddenly:
DANNY
Wait!   Wait! Shhhh!
Everyone freezes. Danny puts his hand up to his ear to try
to listen for the sound he thought he heard. We hear the
faint sound of somebody singing to themselves.
Danny and Rusty quickly realize it's coming from behind the
bookcase. What the hell?

They yank open the false bookcase to reveal a handsome
Frenchman who has just finished cleaning out the contents of
Vanderspeigle's safe.
Danny and Rusty stare at him.   He turns around and sees
them, but if he's bothered in the slightest he sure isn't
showing it. Danny approaches him. This exchange is whispered
with a great amount of drama at very close range.
