was twenty-five. Hard to believe.
Grandfather was a lawman. Father

7|VOICE OVER|"Some of the old-time sheriffs never
even wore a gun. A lot of folks find
that hard to believe. Jim Scarborough
never carried one. That's the younger

one. Up in Comanche County."|speech

day. None of them show people or human habitation."|stage direction
9|VOICE OVER|"I always liked to hear about the old-
timers. Never missed a chance to do
so. Nigger Hoskins over in Bastrop
County knowed everbody's phone number
off by heart. You can't help but
compare yourself against the old-
timers. Can't help but wonder how
they would've operated these times.
There was this boy I sent to the gas
chamber at Huntsville here a while
back. My arrest and my testimony. He
killed a fourteen-year-old girl.
Papers said it was a crime of passion
but he told me there wasn't any
passion to it."|speech

kill somebody for about as long as
he could remember. Said that if they
turned him out he'd do it again."|speech

police car stopped on the shoulder. A young sheriff's deputy
is opening the rear door on the far side of the car."|stage direction

Be there in about fifteen minutes. I
don't know what to make of that. I
surely don't."|speech

hand enters to take the prisoner by one arm."|stage direction

even take its measure. It's not that
I'm afraid of it."|speech
17||"Back to the shot over the light bars: the deputy, with a
hand on top of the prisoner's head to help him clear the
door frame, eases the prisoner into the backseat. All we see
of the prisoner is his dark hair disappearing into the car."|stage direction
18|VOICE OVER|"I always knew you had to be willing
to die to even do this job -- not to
be glorious. But I don't want to
push my chips forward and go out and
meet something I don't understand."|speech

door and reaches down for something-apparently heavy-at his
feet."|stage direction

but I don't know what it is anymore."|speech
21||"The deputy swings the heavy object into the front passenger
seat. Matching inside the car: it looks like an oxygen tank
with a petcock at the top and tubing running off it."|stage direction

know. A man would have to put his

32|DEPUTY|...Yessir I got it covered.|speech
33||"As the deputy reaches forward to hang up, the prisoner is
raising his hands out of frame just behind him. The manacled
hands drop back into frame in front of the deputy's throat
and jerk back and up.
Wider: the prisoner's momentum brings both men crashing
backward to the floor, face-up, deputy on top.
The deputy reaches up to try to get his hands under the
strangling chain.
The prisoner brings pressure. His wrists whiten around the
manacles."|stage direction
34||"The deputy's legs writhe and stamp. He moves in a clumsy
circle, crabbing around the pivot-point of the other man's
back arched against the floor.
The deputy's flailing legs kick over a wastebasket, send
spinning the castored chair, slam at the desk.
Blood creeps around the friction points where the cuffs bite
the prisoner's wrists. Blood is being spit by the deputy.
The prisoner feels with his thumb at the deputy's neck and
averts his own face. A yank of the chain ruptures the carotid
artery. It jets blood.
The blood hits the office wall, drumming hollowly."|stage direction

from the desert floor.
A pan of the horizon discovers a distant herd of antelope.
The animals are grazing.
Reverse on a man in blue jeans and cowboy boots sitting on
his heels, elbows on knees, peering through a pair of
binoculars. A heavy-barreled rifle is slung across his back.
This is Moss.
He lowers the binoculars, slowly unslings the rifle and looks
through its sight.
The view through the sight swims for a moment to refind the
herd. One animal is staring directly at us, its motion
arrested as if it's heard or seen something.
Close on Moss's eyes, one at the sight, the other closed."|stage direction

Point-of-view through the sight: Moss adjusts to bring the
cross-hairs back down to the staring animal.
Moss's finger tightens on the trigger.
Shot: gunbuck swishes the point-of-view upward.
Moss fights it back down.
The point-of-view through the sight finds the beast again,
still staring at us.
The sound of the gunshot rings out across the barial.
Short beat.
The bullet hits the antelope: not a kill. The animal recoils
and runs, packing one leg.
The other animals are off with it."|stage direction

binoculars around his neck. He is looking at the ground.
An intermittent trail of blood.
Moss's pace is brisk. Distances are long.
He suddenly stops, staring.
On the ground is the fresh trail of blood, the glistening
drops already dry at the periphery. But this trail is crossed
by another trail of blood. Drier.
Moss looks one way along this older trail:
His point-of-view: flatlands. Scrub. No movement.
He looks the other way.
A distant range of mountains. No movement.
He stoops to examine the trail."|stage direction
61||"He paces it 'til he finds a print clear enough to give him
the animal's orientation.
He stands and looks again toward the distant mountains. He
brings up the binoculars.
His point-of-view: landscape, swimming into focus, heat waves
exaggerated by the compression of the lens.
Panning, looking for the animal.
Movement, very distant. The animal is brought into focus: a
black tailless dog, huge head, limping badly, phantasmal by
virtue of the rippling heat waves and the silence.
Moss lowers the glass. A moment of thought as he gazes off.
He turns and heads in the direction from which the dog came."|stage direction

the ready.
Flies drone.
He circles two dead bodies lying in the grass, covered with
blood. A gut-shot dog of the same kind we saw limping toward
the mountains lies beside them. A sawed-off shotgun with a
pistol stock lies in the grass.
The tires and most of the window glass are shot out of the
first pickup Moss approaches.
He opens the door and looks inside.
The driver is dead, leaning over the wheel. Moss shuts the
door."|stage direction

looks at it. He looks back at the man. The man is still
staring at him. Without lowering his eyes Moss reaches in
and takes the pistol.
Moss straightens up out of the truck and slings the rifle
back over his shoulder. He snaps the clip off the machine
pistol, checks it and snaps it back on.
Moss crosses to the back of the truck and lifts the tarp
that covers the truck bed.

quite small on the ground.
One hand holds a .45 automatic.
Next to the body is a boxy leather document case.
Moss looks at the man. He takes the gun, looks at it, sticks
it in his belt.
He drags the document case away from the body and opens it.
Bank-wrapped hundreds fill it. Each packet is stamped
""$10,000.""
Moss stares. He reaches in to rifle the stacks, either to
confirm that the bag is full or to estimate the amount.

He checks the .45 taken off the corpse with the money.
Wider: the pickup truck parked outside the cattle guard.
After a beat, the truck drives over the grate onto the unpaved

the gallon jug. Softly:"|stage direction
150|MOSS|Hello?...|speech
151||"No answer.
He opens the door.
The man's body is still held upright by the shoulder harness

Moss glances at the bed of the truck.
Empty.
He again looks at the horizon."|stage direction
152||"Now another pickup stands in silhouette next to his own.
Two men are there.
Moss covers behind the dead man's truck. He eases his head
out for another look.
Only one man visible now.
Sounds hard to identify. Something airy. Up on the crest his
pickup rocks and settles. Its tires are being slashed.
The other pickup's engine coughs to life. Headlights and
roof lights go on.
Moss again covers behind the vehicle.
A search-spot sweeps back and forth across the basin tableau
of bodies and trucks. After a few trips back and forth
something happens to the spot: its weaving light begins to
bounce. We can hear the jouncing suspension of the pickup as
it trundles down the incline.
But the light tells the perspective of the slowly approaching
truck. Moss stays in the lee of his sheltering vehicle as he
runs, doubled over, directly away from the light, keeping to
the shadow that wipes on and off.
A gunshot. Its impact kicks up dirt just ahead of Moss to
his right.
Moss turns to see:
Two jogging men flanking the truck like infantry escorting a
tank. One has just halted to fire; the other is now raising
his gun.
Moss tacks and sprints and rolls under a second abandoned
pickup to his left. Another shot sounds and misses.
Bullets plunk into the metal of the truck body. One bullet
skips off the dirt in front of the truck and pings up into
the undercarriage.
Moss is elbowing out the far side, next to a body lying by
the truck's passenger door.
The firing has stopped: Moss steals a look over the hood:
The pursuing pickup is slowing so that the two gunmen can
swing onto the running boards.
The truck accelerates and as it veers around the first
abandoned pickup its lights swing off Moss's cover truck."|stage direction

We hear the pickup's engine racing and see, behind Moss, its
spot sweeping backlight across the crest.
Moss is running towards the declivity of a river gorge. Sky
there is pink from unrisen sun.
Moss bears on the gorge, panting.
The pickup bounces up into view on the crest behind him,
roof lights blazing. It is pointed off at an angle. Its
spotlight sweeps the river plain.
It finds Moss. The truck reorients as it bounces down in
pursuit. A muzzle flash precedes the dull whump of the
shotgun.
Moss races on toward the river. Another shotgun whump.
Moss stumbles, turns to look behind him.
The truck, gaining ground. A man stands up out of the sunroof,
one hand on top of the cab, the other holding a shotgun.
Moss is almost to the steep riverbank. Another whump of the
shotgun.
Shot catches Moss on the right shoulder. It tears the back
of his shirt away and sends him over the crest of the river
bank.
Moss airborne, ass over elbows, hits near the bottom of the
sandy slope with a loud fhump.
He rolls to a stop and looks up.
We hear a skidding squeal and see dirt and dust float over
the lip of the ridge, thrown by the truck's hard stop.
As Moss pulls off his boots we hear voices from the men in
the truck.
There is the clank of its tailgate being dropped and sounds
of activity on the hollow metal of its bed."|stage direction

the fast-moving water. A look back:
Something shakes the scrub down the steep slope.
Moss backpedals deeper.
Bursting out of the scrub at the foot of the slope: a huge
black dog with a large head and clipped ears. It bounds toward
Moss.
Moss turns and half stumbles, half dives into the river.

Moss breaks the surface of the water, gasping, and looks"|stage direction

Moss pulls the gun from his belt. He takes the clip out and
ejects the chamber round.
The dog finds his stumpy legs much closer to the sandbar:
his massive head dips and waggles as he lurches out of his
swim. He emerges from the river and bounds across the sand.
Moss shakes the gun and blows into the barrel.
The dog splashes through the riverwash that separates him
from the human.
Moss reinserts the clip. He chambers a round as the dog runs
snarling and as the dog leaps he fires.
Moss fires twice more quickly, not waiting to see whether
the first round told.
The dog lands, stopped but not dead. It jerks and gurgles."|stage direction

He meticulously picks shirt fiber out from where buckshot
packed it into the flesh.

The shot gun and document case are on the floor by the bed.
Moss swings the document case onto the bed and unclasps it
and upends the money onto the bed. He feels the bottom of
the case, squeezing it with one hand inside and one hand
out, looking for a false bottom. He eyeballs the case, turning
it over and around.
He starts riffling money packets.
He finds one that binds. It has hundreds on the outside but
ones inside with the centers cut out. In the hollow is a
sending unit the size of a Zippo lighter.
He holds the sender, staring at it.
A long beat."|stage direction
756||"From somewhere, a dull chug. The sound is hard to read-a
compressor going on, a door thud, maybe something else.
The sound has brought Moss's look up. He sits listening. No
further sound.
Moss reaches to uncradle the rotary phone by the bed. He
dials 0.
We hear ringing filtered through the handset. Also, faintly,
offset, we hear the ring direct from downstairs.
After five rings Moss cradles the phone.
He goes to the door, reaches for the knob, but hesitates.
He gets down on his hands and knees and listens at the crack
under the door.
An open airy sound like a seashell put to your ear.
Moss rises and turns to the bed. He piles money back into
the document case but freezes suddenly-for no reason we can
see.
A long beat on his motionless back. We gradually become aware
of a faint high-frequency beeping, barely audible. Its source
is indeterminate.
Moss clasps the document case, picks up his shotgun and eases
himself to a sitting position on the bed, facing the door.
He looks at the line of light under it.
The beeps approach, though still not loud. A long wait.
At length a soft shadow appears in the line of light below
the door. It lingers there. The beeping-stops.
A beat. Now the soft shadow becomes more focused. It resolves
into two columns of dark: feet planted before the door.
Moss raises his shotgun toward the door.
A long beat.
Moss adjusts his grip on the shotgun and his finger tightens
on the trigger.
The shadow moves, unhurriedly, rightward. The band of light
beneath the door is once again unshadowed.
Quiet. Moss stares."|stage direction
757||"The band of light under the door.
Moss stares.
Silently, the light goes out.
Something for Moss to think about. He stares.
The hallway behind the door is now dark. The door is defined
only from his side, by streetlight-spill through the window.
Moss stares. He shifts, starts to rise, doesn't. A beat.
A report -- not a gunshot, but a stamping sound, followed by
a pneumatic hiss.
It brings a dull impact and Moss recoils, hit.
He winces, feeling his chest.
The door is shuddering creakily in.
It is all strange. Moss gropes in his lap and picks something
up. The lock cylinder.
The creaking door comes to rest, ajar.
Moss fires. The shotgun blast roars in the confined space
and for an instant turns the room orange. The chewed-up door
wobbles back against the jamb and creakily bounces in again.
Moss has already risen and is hoisting the document case.
FROM OUTSIDE HIS WINDOW
Moss finishes draping his shotgun by its strap across his
back and climbs out onto the ledge with the document case.
He swings the document case out and drops it.
The bracketing for the hotel's sign gives Moss a handhold.
He grabs it as inside the room the door is kicked open. Moss
swings down as, with a muted thump, orange muzzleflash strobes
the room.
Moss drops."|stage direction

Moss sags. He looks back across the lobby at the front door.

Long beat. Stillness.
A panicky thought brings his look and the shotgun swinging
back around: the man could round the block the other way.
Empty street.
Two empty streets: Moss doesn't know which way to cover,
which way to go.
He stands looking each way, trying to devise a plan. No basis
for a plan.
Quiet hesitation.
Now, a sound: engine noise.
An old pickup rounds a corner two blocks up. It rattles toward
him.
Moss lowers the shotgun. He keeps it to the hidden side of
his body.
The pickup dutifully stops at a flashing red traffic light.

A quick second round pushes part of the windshield in.
Rounds come in without pause, cracking sheet metal, blowing
the cab's rear window into the truckbed, twisting the rear-
view.
A round seems to have caught the driver in the throat: a
gurgling scream as he claws at his windpipe, blowing out
blood.
Moss, quicker to react, has already ducked below the dash.
A snap of the driver's head and a new freshet of blood from
a shot to the head. The screams turn to low gurgles.
Moss, jammed almost in to the driver's lap, frantically gropes
for the shift.
He throws the pickup into drive and stamps at the accelerator,
driving blind as bullets continue to pour in.
He raises his head enough to see his side-view. It shows
sluing, bouncing, empty street, rough guide for steering.
A tremendous jounce up onto the curb then off it, the driver's
body swaying in its restraint.
The passenger side window shatters: we are passing the gunman.
Now Moss sits up to steer looking out front. Behind him
through the shot-out back window the dark street is suddenly
punctured by muzzleflash. It comes, for the first time, with
a report: the low chug of the muted shotgun.
Rattle of shot against sheet metal.
Moss floors the gas to roar into a turn. The street sweeping

He sits leaning back against the car, waiting.
His point-of-view: his own reflection in the facing

He sinks lower.

Footsteps. They approach without hurry.
A gritty boot turn at the corner. The footsteps come closer
still.
They pass and recede toward the pickup.
We cut to Chigurh approaching the pickup, shotgun held at
ease across his body.
He slows.
Moss: he hears the slowing steps. He tightens his grip on
his shotgun and tenses.
Chigurh: slowing further, he sees:
Bloody boot prints outside the passenger door.
Moss rises.
Chigurh is turning.
He dives as, behind him, Moss fires.
Shot peppers two parked cars -- the one Moss rammed and the
one behind.
Chigurh dived between them: hit or not?
Moss advances down the middle of the street. He angles his
head: anything under the cars?
He fires twice. Buckshot claws up the pavement and the car
bodies and tires, and the cars sink hissing to their rims.
