1   INT. DERELICT BUILDING - DAY                                      1
WE MEET: MUMBLES(late 30s) and ONE TWO (late 30s). They are
listening to a sales pitch from two REAL ESTATE AGENTS.
We SEE all the relevant pictures of their pitch explaining a
changing city, LONDON.
SLICK ESTATE AGENT (V.O.)
Two years ago this property cost one
million pounds.
(we SEE building)
Today, it costs five million.
The camera WHIP PANS over to another part of the building to
see the other ESTATE AGENT giving his pitch. The camera
will keep this back and forth for the duration of the scene.
OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT (V.O.)
How did this happen?
(CUT TO relevant"|unknown

2||"Attractive tax opportunities for
foreign investment, restrictive
building consent and massive hedge
fund bonuses,...
(beat)
London, my good man, is fast becoming
the financial and cultural capital
of the world.
SLICK ESTATE AGENT
And of course the Russians have come
to town.
OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT
Makes it hard to compete with an ex-
Soviet oligarch that has six billion
dollars in his back pocket. They
don't haggle the price, they double
the price.
SLICK ESTATE AGENT
Russians come, prices rise, and it
doesn't stop. It only goes one way.
OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT
Up.
SLICK ESTATE AGENT
I can't teach you how to skin a cat,
but I can tell you a lot about the
money in bricks and mortar.

LAWYER TYPE
These are the plans,...it costs ten

6   INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE                                             6
We CUT BACK to our LAWYER now smug.    One Two and Mumbles are

in and grabs the case, but it's chained to CHECHNYAN 2's
wrist. One Two pulls the arm out of the window and Mumbles
uses massive bolt cutters to cut the case free."|unknown

on and on. CHECHNYAN 2 has ripped off his jacket, we can

sweat, he seems unstoppable. One Two gets confident and
starts to run backwards egging CHECHNYAN 2 on, CHECHNYAN 2
is a good runner, but not good enough. Deep hate fills his
eyes as One Two makes a fool out of him, CHECHNYAN 2 will
remember this man. One Two is taking complete liberties, he
almost stops and waits until CHECHNYAN 2 has caught up to
him and then he tears off, the CHECHNYAN keeps coming.
One Two see's in the distance a tiny moped approaching from
a distance, its CHECHNYAN 1 who completely out sizes the
machine. However, he's moving and it's moving faster than
One Two. One Two ducks off the tracks and over a wall, the
moped gets nearer. At least when he gets over the wall, the
moped won't follow right? One Two's over. He can hear the
moped on the other side, One Two looks over his shoulder he
can see the moped being lifted over the wall. ""Oh shit.""

Two's head phones. He opens his eyes, on his throat lies a
very long and sharp knife. The two CHECHNYANS have entered

the blade. He smiles, One Two doesn't.

The music is very loud, it's Russian. Archy and Danny make
their way to it's source, up the stairs, to the bedroom door.
The base thumps out. Archy tries the handle, it turns, he
pushes the door open slowly. The music becomes clear as we
reveal a horrible scene. Archy is shocked, but a little
amused.
Tied to the bed, back to front with a pillow over his head
is One Two. A large blade is resting on his back, a bottle
of vodka is open on the side, One Two cries and wriggles
uselessly.

He is wearing military speedos and fuck all else apart from
his military hat. He is ""having much fun."" His massive
frame is still black and blue from the beating One Two
previously inflicted. The other Chechnyan (similarly
dressed), is digging into his bag of tools, extracting all
sorts of horrible looking things. Archy looks on amazed by
the show, he has a quick look at Danny who is also bemused.
