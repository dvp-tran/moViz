0||"THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON
Written by
Eric Roth
Based on the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald
10/30/07
As all things do, it begins in the dark. EYES blink
open. Blue eyes. The first thing they see is a WOMAN
near 40, standing looking out a window, watching the wind
blowing, rattling a window.
A WOMAN'S (V.O.)
What are you looking at?
CAROLINE
The wind, Mother... They say a
hurricane is on its way... You've
been asleep... I was waiting to
see you...
1   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT          1
Now we see we're in a hospital room with layers of white
enamel paint trying without success to hide the years...
An old WOMAN, past 80, withered, still regal with a green
turban around her bald head is propped by pillows, her
blue eyes looking out at us from her bed... She's
connected to an intravenous for sustenance and a morphine
drip... Her name, is DAISY FULLER. She speaks with a
Southern lilt.
DAISY
If it wasn't for hurricanes we
wouldn't have a hurricane season.
CAROLINE
I've forgotten what the weather
can be like here. I've lived with
four seasons so many years now.
We see a young Black Woman, a ""caregiver,"" DOROTHY BAKER,
in a corner, thumbing a magazine, with one eye at the
window...
DOROTHY BAKER
I saw on the news they're
predicting trouble...
DAISY
1928 they stacked people like
firewood to close a hole in a
levee.
But Daisy has other things on her mind... murmuring...

DAISY (CONT'D)
It all runs together... like a
fingerpainting... I feel like I'm
on a boat, drifting...
CAROLINE
(tenderly)
Can I do anything for you, Mother?
Make anything easier?
DAISY
Hmmm. There is nothing to do,
Caroline. This is what it is...
I'm finding it harder to keep my
eyes open... my mouth all filled
with cotton...
And agitated, feeling confined, she scratches at her
nightgown as if it were sticking to her... she starts to take
it off... Dorothy gets up and straightens it for her.
DOROTHY BAKER
There, there, Miss Daisy... you'll
scratch yourself to ribbons...
(to Caroline)
It's their way of letting go...
(the finality)
...prob'ly today.
Caroline is well aware of it, but the words, her
admonition of death being so close at hand, makes
everything even more present...
CAROLINE
Do you want more medication,
Mother? The doctor said you can
have all you want.
Daisy is quiet, looking into the distance. Caroline,
seeking closure, sits on the bed with her and starts to
cry. Daisy puts her thin arms around her daughter,
comforting her.
CAROLINE (CONT'D)
A friend told me she never had a
chance to say goodbye to her
mother.
(grateful to have the
chance)
I wanted to thank you, Mother, for
bringing me into this world. For
raising me so well.

CAROLINE (CONT'D)
I wanted to tell you how much
you've meant to me. I'm going to
miss you so much...
They hold each other for some time... They separate...
And there's an awkwardness they have nothing left to talk
about... nothing left to say to each other... a hole in
their relationship... Caroline fills it with the eternal
question...
CAROLINE (CONT'D)
Are you afraid?
DAISY
Curious.   What comes next...
She winces at some physical pain.
DOROTHY BAKER
The pain's coming more steadily...
Her breathing will falter soon...
No need for her to suffer..
She raises the morphine level... Daisy closes her eyes...
drifting with the morphine... and a thought, a dream, a
sound, crosses her mind... and she says...
DAISY
They built that train station in
1918. Your father was there the
day it opened... He said a tuba
band was playing...Oom-pah-pah...
2   EXT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918         2
And we see a TUBA BAND is playing while a ribbon cutting
ceremony is taking place across the steps of the new
TRAIN STATION...
DAISY
Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah...The
finest clockmaker in all of the
South built that clock...
3   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1917           3
We see an old French Quarter storefront with an endless
array of clocks and watches...
DAISY'S (V.O.)
His name was Mr. Gateau. Mr.
Cake.

4   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT       4
The slightest of smiles crosses Daisy's lips... saying to
herself again... ""Mr. Cake...""
5   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT       5
We see a diminutive man in a frock coat with small,
delicate hands, ""Mr. Cake,"" working in his downstairs
workshop. More than a few clocks stroke midnight, a
handsome Creole Woman comes into the workshop...

He was married to a Creole of
Evangeline Parish and they had a
son.
Taking his arm, she helps him up to show him to his bed.
DAISY'S (V.O.) (CONT'D)
Did I mention, Mr. Gateau was from
birth, absolutely blind.

...The clockmaker his fine hands blindly working...
DAISY'S (V.O.)
And when their son came of age,
like boys will do, he joined the
army. They saw him off at the old
train station.
7   EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1917                7
An old wooden barn of a building. Their son, hugging his
parents, getting on a flatbed train crowded with other
soldiers, pulling away... Mr. Gateau, blindly waving his
hat goodbye to his son...
DAISY'S (V.O.)
Oh how he worked, for months he
did nothing but work on the clock
for the great train station.
8   INT. WORKSHOP BELOW THE CLOCKMAKER'S HOME - NIGHT, 1918        8
The sound of clocks constant ticking. Mr. Gateau at
work...
DAISY'S (V.O.)
One day a letter came...
Blanche comes into the workshop... a letter in her
hand... She reads to her blind husband...
BLANCHE DEVEREUX
""I am sorry to inform you that
your son was killed fighting for
his country, at the battle of the
Marne. In the death of Sgt.
Martin Gateau I lose one of my

When I informed members of our
company he had fallen, on every

sorrow... ...we were in hope the
Lord would spare him to return

the purple swath... People gasp at the magnificent
clock... ""Mr. Cake"" winds the clock, which chimes a
