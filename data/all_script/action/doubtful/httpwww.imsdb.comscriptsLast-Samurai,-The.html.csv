Algren, Gant, and the Japanese Offi cers call out orders but all discipline
soon breaks down -- it is every man for himself--
The battle swirls ever ywhere around us. Fleeing soldiers are run through by
lances, run down and trampled by horses.
Each samurai wears individual, vibrantly col ored armor. Various battle
flags sweep through the fog.
Gant uses his two cavalry revolvers -- firing constantly -- finally out of
ammo he drops from his horse in the cavalry st yle and pulls a Winchester
repeating rifle, crouching and quickly firing--
Algren uses his revol ver first -- firing as he turns on his horse -- when
the revol ver is empty he pulls his cavalry saber. He manages to parry
the lethal blows as the Samurai hurtle past --
But one Samurai, his armor all in black, comes at him on a collision course
and SLAMS INTO HIM, sending both horse and rider to the ground.
Algren scrambles to his feet, his saber nowhere to be found as another
rider heads toward him carrying a lance.
Algren manages to grab it and throw the rider to the ground, wrestling the
lance from his grip and running him through.
In the midst of the battle we notice a peculiar thing. One samurai is just sitting
on his horse. Watching Algren. This samurai wears a BLACK MASK.
The MASKED SAMUARI watches Algren fight.
Algren now wields the lance to battle the horsemen as they sweep past. He
spears one and then unseats another. When a third samurai cuts his lance in
half, Algren uses the remaining half as a club to take him down.
The Masked Samurai continues to watch Algren. Algren's tenacity is amazing.
He continues to fight with heroic passion, refusing to give an inch, long after
Those around him have fled.
Then a blaze of bright yellow ­ a samurai in yellow armor galloping past, firing
arrows steadily from horseback. His control and speed are astounding.
We will come to know him as YORITOMO, a handsome young samurai.
Yoritomo fires arrow upon arrow ­ the speed is breathtaking ­ Two arrows
slam into Gant, knocking him to the ground.
The battle, meanwhile, has become a rout. Those Imperial soldiers who fight
are easily cut down. Those who flee are run down like prey.
Left alone, Algren finds himself confronted by ashigaru ­ samurai foot
soldiers carrying pikes. He turns to discover his retreat cut off by other"|stage direction

614||"samurai wielding katana ­ the lethal long sword.
But rather than give any quarter, Algren launches an attack. He kills one
samurai before he is RUN THROUGH, at the shoulder, by a lance.
In agony, Algren SNAPS OFF the hilt of the lance, leaving its tip buried
deep in his chest, and fights on.
He manages to parry a blow ­ which SLICES into his side. The next blow
takes off a piece of his scalp. Blood fl ows down his faces and into his eyes.
Algren is now surrounded by ten samurai. A man's heroic stand against
certain death is of great interest to them. As they begin to close in, Algren
whirls the lance around, a tattered battle-flag with TIGER INSIGNIA still
dangling from the end.
The MASKED SAMURAI removes his mask. It is the JAPANESE MAN,
whose dream of the tiger we glimpsed at the beginning of the story. His
eyes wide in surprise, he watches his dream come to life--the blue tiger
holding the dogs at bay.
In SLOW MOTION Algren whirls the lance, as one samurai, wearing
BLOOD-RED ARMOR, advances. With a murderous smile, he draws his
katana.
Algren seems spent ­ he drops to one knee, swaying, on the brink of losing
consciousness.
But as the RED SAMURAI, lets out a battle cry and propels himself forward for the death blow - Algren
suddenly LEAPS UP and propels the jagged wooden end of the broken lance into the unprotected throat of his
attacker.
As the samurai falls, the rest of his comrades close in to cut Algren off.
A harsh COMMAND stops them in their tracks.
The Masked Samurai leaps from his horse. Everyone steps aside deferentially
so that be might pass by without being jostled.                    .
He looks down at Algren, then removes his battle helmet.
And we meet _MORI KATSUMOTO, the leader of the samurai. He it an
imposing man of about Algren's years.
Sensing that he is about to be killed, Algren pulls himself t o his knees, and SWINGS his saber at Katsumoto.
With blinding speed, Katsumoto pulls his katana from its scabbard.
Algren's saber is SNAPPED CLEANLY IN TWO.
Katsumoto looks down at Algren.
Then Gant appears behind Katsumoto -- limping toward him, cocking his
rifle, urgently trying to save Algren--

protect his Lord. His sword flashes--"|stage direction

Algren finally wrenches himself from under his horse. He crawls to Gant,
blood pouring from his own injured back and shoulder.
Gant is dead.
Algren looks up to see the battle is lost. The Japanese soldiers have fled.
Or are surrendering, injured or dead.
And he sees one other thing. General Yoshitaka is still on his horse,
head down. He has not pulled his sword. He has not been hurt.
Katsumoto rides to Yoshitaka. A few serious words are exchanged. Katsumoto bows his bead in respect, seems
to agree to something.
Both men climb from their horses. General Yoshitaka pulls out a small b1ade and hands it to Katsumoto, who
holds it out firmly.
General Yoshitaka quickly and calmly pulls himself on to the blade, plunging
it into his stomach, embracing Katsumoto.
It is seppuku -- the traditional form of samurai suicide.
Algren watches, stunned.
Then a terrible scream cuts through the battlefield.
Algren sees samurai calmly walking among the injured and captured Imperial
soldiers .. killing them one by one with a single stroke.

com bines athletic prowess and graceful artistry into one effortless whole.
Finally well enough to walk, Algren comes out onto the porch to watch the
spectacle. In front of him, is a Kendo (The Way of the Sword) master
practice with their long and short swords. They have incredible control.
NAKAO, a mountain of a man, is a Karate master. He stands unarmed,
four samurai facing him. They attack with wooden swords. He effortlessly
defeats them -- the agility of the huge man is shocking.

Yoritomo holds a bundle of arrows. In the distance, a line of plums.

strips off his filthy uniform then lowers himself into the steaming water.
Yoritomo begins taking off hit own kimono. A1gren is taken aback. Used to

time, walks back with Yoritomo. Kids start walking with them, pointing at
his Japanese garb, laughing as he stumbles in his wooden clogs. They pass
by Ujio training a group of samurai using wooden kendo swords.
Nearby, Higen and Toshiie are imitating the grown-ups, sparring with wooden
swords that are much too big for them. Yoritomo watches his nephews proudly,
murmuring details of their prowess to Algren, who has no idea what he's talking
about.
Higen charges his little brother, but goes careening past, right toward Algren,
who deftl y dodges out of the wa y. This causes gales of laughter from the
boys, one of whom takes Toshiie's sword and offers it to Algren.
Algren looks at the sword in his hand and unthinkingly twirls if with a f1ourish --
causing the boys to applaud. Yoritomo bows, and encourages A1gren in
Higen's direction. Algren shakes his head politely, but Higen is already on
the attack.
Algren dodges one thrust, then parries another, as the boys begin to cheer.
Suddenly, ever yone goes silent. Algren turns.
Ujio is standing behind him, arms folded.
Ujio barks a command in Japanese. He wants Algren to drop the sword.
It is obvious to Algren what it must mean, but he does nothing.
Ujio approaches Algren slowl y. Algren holds the wooden sword casually,
only his eyes betraying the tension of the moment.
Ujio's wooden sword FLASHES, quicker than the eye can follow. Algren's
sword is knocked from his hands, then, somehow in the same fluid
movement, Ujio brings the sword around and cracks Algren across the
chest hard enough to knock the breath from his body and lend him to his
kneels.
Satisfied with himself, Uji o starts to walk away, but the expressions of the
bystanders cause him to turn back: .
Algren is standing again, and again holding the sword.
With grim purpose, Uji o returns to Algren, who has assumed a ready pose.
Again Ujio's SWORD FLASHES. Algren manages to parry one blow, before
he is cracked across the face, and blood begins to flow free1y from his nose."|stage direction

Again, Algren manages to stand up, and before Ujio can turn, charges him.
But Uji o doesn't need to turn. In a sliding move, he dodges and cracks Algren
in the side, then the legs, then the neck. Gasping for breath, at least one rib broken,
Algren writhes on the ground. Ujio digs the point of his sword into
Algren's hand until he releases his grip. Again Ujio kicks the sword away.
The ever-enlarging crowd gasps as Algren once again struggles to his feet.
This time without hesitation, Uji o runs back and rains blows upon Algren's
now defenseless body. First the wrist, then the back, then the stomach, then
finally the head.
Algren hits the ground, unconscious, his fingers still clutching the sword.
Ujio reaches down, pries it from his fingers, and breaks it across his knee."|stage direction

Gradually all SOUND drains away. We hear only Algren's steady breathing. He is
aware of everything. A bird in a tree. A woman grinding rice. A plum about to fall.

Algren presses forward, his sword slashing masterfully, forcing Ujio back
Ujio counters with complex moves as he retreats --Algren keeps moving

movement. Algren ends with the edge of his wooden sword It Ujio's throat.

Algren twirls his sword in a fancy cavalry ""fl ourish."" The pride he has alwa ys taken in his

him around like a wrestler, throwing him finally onto the upraised pike of a
fellow Imperial soldier. But now three more soldiers have levelled their
