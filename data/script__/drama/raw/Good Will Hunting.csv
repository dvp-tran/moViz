heavy, quiet, someone you definitely wouldn't want to tangle
with.
Finally there is MORGAN O'MALLY, 19, smaller than the other
guys. Wiry and anxious, Morgan listens to Chuckie's horror
stories with eager disgust.
All four boys speak with thick Boston accents. This is a
rough, working class Irish neighborhood and these boys are
its product."|stage direction

Will's momentum and respectable strength serve to knock the
hapless Champa out cold.
As soon as Will hits Bobby, his friends CONVERGE ON WILL.
Billy JUMPS IN and wrestles one guy to the ground. The two
exchange messy punches on the sidewalk.
Will is in trouble, back pedaling, dodging punches, trying
to avoid being overrun.
When Will goes for one guy, another has an open shot and he
HAMMERS WILL with a right hand to the head.
Will is staggered and bleary, as a second guy winds up for a
shot he is BLIND SIDED by Chuckie who hits the kid like he
was a tackling sled, lifting him off the ground.
Chuckie turns to see Will still outnumbered. It's all Will
can do to stay standing as Morgan DROP KICKS one of Champa's
boys from the hood of a car.
Contrary to what we might think, Morgan is actually quite a
fighter. He peppers the kid with a flurry of blows.
The fight is messy, ugly and chaotic. Most punches are thrown
wildly and miss, heads are banged against concrete, someone
throws a bottle.
In the end, it's our guys who are left standing, while Bobby's
friends stagger off. Chuckie and Morgan turn to see Will,
standing over the unconscious Bobby Champa, still POUNDING
him.
ANGLE ON WILL: SAVAGE, UGLY, VICIOUS, AND VIOLENT
Whatever demons must be raging inside Will, he is taking
them out on Bobby Champa. He pummels the helpless, unconscious

give me the skinny on every art book
ever written... Michelangelo? You
know a lot about him I bet. Life's
work, criticisms, political
aspirations. But you couldn't tell
me what it smells like in the Sistine
Chapel. You've never stood there and
looked up at that beautiful ceiling.
And if I asked you about women I'm
sure you could give me a syllabus of
your personal favorites, and maybe
you've been laid a few times too.
But you couldn't tell me how it feels
to wake up next to a woman and be
truly happy. If I asked you about
war you could refer me to a bevy of
fictional and non-fictional material,
but you've never been in one. You've
never held your best friend's head
in your lap and watched him draw his
last breath, looking to you for help.
And if I asked you about love I'd
get a sonnet, but you've never looked
at a woman and been truly vulnerable.
Known that someone could kill you
with a look. That someone could rescue
you from grief. That God had put an
angel on Earth just for you.  And
you wouldn't know how it felt to be
her angel. To have the love be there
for her forever. Through anything,
through cancer. You wouldn't know
about sleeping sitting up in a
hospital room for two months holding
her hand and not leaving because the
doctors could see in your eyes that
the term ""visiting hours"" didn't
apply to you. And you wouldn't know
about real loss, because that only
occurs when you lose something you
love more than yourself, and you've
never dared to love anything that
much. I look at you and I don't see
an intelligent confident man, I don't
see a peer, and I don't see my equal.
I see a boy. Nobody could possibly
understand you, right Will? Yet you
presume to know so much about me
because of a painting you saw.  You
must know everything about me.  You're
an orphan, right?"|speech

Personally, I don't care. There's

puts a code on my desk, something
nobody else can break. So I take a
shot at it and maybe I break it. And
I'm real happy with myself, 'cause I
did my job well.  But maybe that
code was the location of some rebel
army in North Africa or the Middle
East. Once they have that location,
they bomb the village where the rebels
were hiding and fifteen hundred people
I never had a problem with get killed.
(rapid fire) Now the politicians are
sayin' ""send in the Marines to secure
the area"" 'cause they don't give a
shit. It won't be their kid over
there, gettin' shot. Just like it
wasn't them when their number got
called, 'cause they were pullin' a
tour in the National Guard. It'll be
some guy from Southie takin' shrapnel
in the ass.  And he comes home to
find that the plant he used to work
at got exported to the country he
just got back from. And the guy who
put the shrapnel in his ass got his
old job, 'cause he'll work for fifteen
cents a day and no bathroom breaks.
Meanwhile my buddy from Southie
realizes the only reason he was over
there was so we could install a
government that would sell us oil at
a good price. And of course the oil
companies used the skirmish to scare
up oil prices so they could turn a
quick buck. A cute, little ancillary
benefit for them but it ain't helping
my buddy at two-fifty a gallon. And
naturally they're takin' their sweet
time bringin' the oil back and maybe
even took the liberty of hiring an
alcoholic skipper who likes to drink
seven and sevens and play slalom
with the icebergs and it ain't too
long 'til he hits one, spills the
oil, and kills all the sea-life in
the North Atlantic. So my buddy's
out of work and he can't afford to
drive so he's got to walk to the job
interviews which sucks 'cause the
shrapnel in his ass is givin' him
chronic hemorrhoids.  And meanwhile
he's starvin' 'cause every time he
tries to get a bite to eat the only
blue-plate special they're servin'
is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker
State."|speech

up gas prices, bomb a village, club
a baby seal, hit the hash pipe and
join the National Guard? Christ, I
