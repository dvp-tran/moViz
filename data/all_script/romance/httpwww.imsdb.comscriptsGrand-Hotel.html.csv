Season is March.
Action of the picture takes place in approximately 36 hours.
Picture commences at approximately 12:35 in the day.
Time: The Present.
EXTERIOR REVOLVING DOOR
Show general natural action of people going in and people
coming out but in it is the definite inference of people
arriving and people leaving the big hotel.
MOVE INSIDE THROUGH THE REVOLVING DOOR -- very quickly. CAMERA
PAUSES ON THE THRESHOLD like a human being, seeing and
hearing.
DISSOLVE OUT.
DISSOLVE INTO: Clock. It is twenty minutes to one -- and
then moves slowly into the crowd of busy mid-day business
jumble.
CAMERA pushes through crowd and passes by the foot of the
steps that lead up to the restaurant. In its journey, it
passes Kringelein looking up. He is not pointed.
THE CAMERA then saunters -- getting a slow profile movement
across -- near Senf's desk. Senf is very busy. THE CAMERA
now passes -- profile -- the desk of Senf. General action.
Senf stands before his background of slots and keys. WE
PROCEED until we are facing the elevator.
At that moment the elevator is opening. Among the people who
emerge is Suzette, who moves too quickly for us to distinguish
who she is.
THE CAMERA PANS quickly with her and in the distance we hear
her saying to Senf:"|stage direction
3|SUZETTE|"Madam Grusinskaya will not want her
car."|speech
4||"This line is only just above the general clatter of action
but it is picked-up sharply first by Senf then by Bell-Captain --
and as the CAMERA SLOWLY TURNS AROUND, we see the boy going
towards the door and we hear the voice in the distance,
saying:"|stage direction
5|VOICE|Cancel Madam Grusinskaya's car.|speech
6||"The CAMERA now backs away from the scene into the BAR. (a
section.) It backs to the back of the bar and proceeds -- in
profile -- behind the backs of the barmen. A mixed crowd of
people drinking before their lunch.
We pick up the Doctor, leaning his head upon his hands,
looking into space. The woman next to him, a noisy blonde,
is laughing. The doctor glances up at her -- she glances at
the doctor. She and the audience see the scarred side of his
face -- the laugh dies on her lips and she turns suddenly to
her companion, who is the Baron. We do not get much of a
chance to see him because at that instant he is glancing at
his watch, his shoulders are turning away from THE CAMERA
and he moves out towards the lobby.
BACK UP a few feet and LAP DISSOLVE as you move into the
main aisle of busy room in restaurant. Great activity of
waiters. The bustle and activity of fashionable lunchtime. A
string orchestra is playing.
Among other things, we pick up the smiling face of the pompous
Maitre d'hotel, he has apparently just shown someone important
to a table.
THE CAMERA watches his face and follows him. His face just
as CAMERA reaches service table. The pompous Maitre d'hotel
now becomes a thing of drama as he demands of a waiter:"|stage direction
7|MAITRE D'HOTEL|Where is that gentleman's soup?|speech
8||"The waiter, frightened and perspiring, doesn't bother to
argue -- he tears off quickly (CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM) to
another service table. The waiter seizes buss-boy's arm:"|stage direction
9|WAITER|Where's that soup?|speech
10||"Boy goes off at great rate of speed, CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM,
into service room of kitchen. Boy stops at soup chef's
counter. He is not the only waiter wanting soup at that
moment. He pushes his way to the front and puts his ticket
forward."|stage direction
11|BOY|Quick -- come on -- come on...|speech
12||"The soup chef, used to impatient waiters, makes no exception
of the young man. He looks at him as much as to say: ""I'll
slap you on the mouth."" At the same time he is pulling over
a cauldron of soup."|stage direction
13||CUT TO:|unknown
14||"CAULDRON OF SOUP being pulled over -- it dislodges a small
cauldron that is near the edge. We see the soup fall and
hear the scream of a woman before showing her agonized face --
She has been scalded. General steamy confusion. The chef has
filled the plate. WE PROCEED the buss-boy out. Half way down
the aisle, the waiter takes it from him.
THE CAMERA follows the waiter who places the soup before Mr.
Preysing. Preysing has been waiting, with his serviette
carefully tucked in his collar. His spoon is in his hand. A
horrible man, ready for action. The soup is in front of him,
he tastes it, pushes it away, frowns, we feel he is going to
tear the place down."|stage direction

told a thing like that. All sorts of
things run through your head. I am
going to stay here in Berlin. I am
never coming back to Fredersdorf.
Never! I want to get something out
of life, too. You plague, and bother,
and save -- and all of a sudden you
are dead. Heinrich... You don't say
anything. I am in the Grand Hotel,
do you understand, the most expensive
hotel in Berlin? I'm going to get a
room here. The very best people stay
here. Our big boss, Preysing, too. I
saw him -- not five minutes after I
was here. Sometime, I'd like to tell
him exactly what I think of him.
Listen, Heinrich -- I have taken all
my savings; my life insurance, too;
I cashed in all my policies, the
sick benefit fund, the old age
pension, the unemployment insurance,
the burial fund and everything...
What's that, miss?... Hello, Heinrich.
I have to hang up now. I have to pay
three times overcharge. Just think,
Heinrich! There's music here all day
long. And in the evening, they go
around in full dress... Yes, sometimes
I have pain, but I can stand it.
Everything is frightfully expensive
here. You can imagine, the Grand

the restaurant converted -- the tall figure of the Baron --
he proceeds through the door of the restaurant --
Note: Question here as to whether Yellow Room will be the
restaurant converted, or not. In which case it will be
necessary to add scene of Baron walking through corridor
upstairs -- giving sense of distance.

Preysing seating himself upon his balcony -- Radio loud

GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY
The Baron knows he is trapped, if he jumps onto Preysing's
balcony, Preysing is the man that will cause the alarm.
Quickly he moves across the room -- tries the door -- it is
locked securely. He looks for skeleton key and then remembers
refusing it from the chauffeur. He is trapped in an absurd
way.
As he moves back from the door, he knocks the telephone off
of the table. He watches it for a moment, realizing that the
operator must now know that there is someone in Grusinskaya's
room.
He picks up the telephone, replaces the receiver, wipes finger
prints off with his handkerchief.
He is moving back to window when telephone starts to ring
suddenly. The thought crosses his mind they they will want
to know who is in the room. He lets the telephone ring.
Crosses to the door again.
Above the din of the telephone we hear the chambermaid's
voice singing an absurd song.
He listens. She is coming in.
The key turns in the door.
Quickly he hides behind the curtains.
Slowly and amusingly the chambermaid, tired and dragging,
enters the room.
He is looking for an opportunity to dash through the door.
After all, this maid should be an easy person to get around.
We have a feeling he wishes to dash through the door.
The chambermaid might be singing the same tune that we hear
from Preysing's radio.

is in fact, ballet.
Quite calmly, Grusinskaya finishes the notes on the table.
She folds it up and places it in a prominent place on the
table, or hangs it over the telephone.
She crosses to the window pulls back the curtains -- the
Baron has been hiding behind a few minutes before.
We see the Baron watching. He glances at the door quickly.
""No, there is not time."" She is returning calmly. She crosses
to the dressing table and takes the veronal out of a drawer.
She looks at it thoughtfully, her lips are trembling a little.
She moves to the radiator as if to seek warmth.
She sinks into a chair and her head droops over her folded
hands which contain the veronal, she seems to pray.
The Baron comes from the closet -- now is his chance, he
looks at the door but can't make it. Looks on the floor for
the key which Grusinskaya has previously thrown there, his
eyes fall upon the note on the telephone -- he reads it.
It is a death farewell note to Suzette -- do not insert it.
At this moment she has finished, the Baron returns to his
hiding place. She makes the sign of a cross and goes to her
bed.
She looks around nervously, apprehensively -- like a deer
who has heard something, then reassured. She places the
veronal on the night table beside the glass of water. She is
quiet and deliberate. She arranges the pillows under her
head and lies down. She reaches for the bottle of veronal
and empties it generously in her hand. She has to lean away
upon one elbow, from the Baron's position, in order to balance
herself.
The Baron steps like a cat from his hiding place. He goes to
the bedside noiselessly and stands there.
She reaches for the glass-her hand stretches out for the
glass. The Baron takes her wrist suddenly.
She turns quickly looking at him. The glass falls to the
floor with a crash and breaks. As she moves, the veronal
falls out of her hands upon the bed. She struggles up to a
sitting position."|stage direction

coming out of a trance. Again she wants to jump from the
bed."|stage direction
753|BARON|"Careful -- there's broken glass on
the floor."|speech
754||"Now she becomes conscious of almost nakedness. She draws her
kimono tightly around her, glances across the wide expanse

is now a woman again -- a woman of the earth -- it would be
a silly movement."|stage direction

was lying across the back of a chair.
Her first movement is not one of alarm but of -- shame. She
draws her robe more closely around her and looks at the Baron
puzzled. She thinks, dreamily, ""What is this?"" She glances
back at the veronal and the bed showing us plainly that this
man must have watched her preparation for bed. We get a sense
of relief with her. She is trembling.
The Baron has controlled his nerves perfectly. He senses his
danger. He is caught red-handed with five hundred thousand
marks worth of pearls in his pocket. He is wondering if she
will ring the bell. For an instant he thinks of escape. He
could dash for the balcony. He could strike her dead or
silence her with threats. There is in the room an intoxicating
sense of romance and danger. (It should be in the scene.)"|stage direction

distinct contrast to Kringelein, whose soul is warmed for
the first time by alcohol.

his head jauntily. The carnation is in his buttonhole.

his bed.
He puts the carnation in the glass, having filled it with
water and then his eyes fall upon his small group of medicine
bottles.
His demeanor changes. He immediately becomes a thing of pain.
He glances at his watch -- it is long past his medicine time --
his spirit droops -- he might almost be in pain.
He picks up a small bottle and carefully counts eight drops
into the glass. He is about to take it, he smells it, a sudden
impulse of well-being surges over him. He flings the medicine
away.

Baron shuts door and pauses. In front of him is the door of
the woman he loves. Down beyond is his own empty room. In
his pockets nothing. In his CLOSEUP he makes the audience
feel his problem with him.
This man who has lived and whistled and love through the
play becomes a tragic, lonely, harrassed figure. The Baron
has broken. His fists dig into his eyes -- he brushes his
hair back.
Over this comes with almost an impertinence, a tiny whistle.

Flaemmchen stands there, a small black bag in her hand. The

themselves. Yet, each about to involve themselves tragically
for the want of a little money.
FLAEMMCHEN'S ROOM
Flaemmchen enters her room cautiously. Except for one lamp
burning the room is in darkness and empty. From the adjoining
door to Preysing's room a thin stream of light. She puts

from her angle.
Preysing stretched on bed flat, his stomach a mountain and
on it the magazine that he has been reading with Flaemmchen's
picture. He is looking at the ceiling. She knows he is awake
because a thin stream of smoke comes from his cigar in his
hand.
FLASH OF FLAEMMCHEN
An idea occurs to her. She could possibly sneak into bed and
he would go to sleep and there would be nothing that night.
CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she tiptoes to her room. She closes
the door noiselessly and listens. She throws off her hat and
takes off her coat. Opens her bag and takes out night dress,
lingerie, etc. The lid of her bag falls suddenly. She starts
at the noise. ""Has it awakened him."" She looks off.
SHOT AT BATHROOM DOOR
The thin stream of light is filled suddenly, the door of the
adjoining room opens and back-lighted from the other room
the huge form of Preysing appears. In this odd lighting he
is a little more than Preysing. He comes forward. He speaks
hoarsely, quietly."|stage direction

Shadow crosses again. ""Who can be in his room?"" He moves
forward and peeps through the window. One side of the French
window is closed. From his angle we see the Baron furtively
searching the room. He is now wearing an overcoat, the collar
is turned up. Business ad lib. He finds Preysing's wallet.

Door opens behind him.
Flaemmchen, with a dressing gown on, light, filmy thing,
crosses and looks down at the Baron, without a word. Preysing
seizes her.
Her hand goes to her head, her eyes roll; for a moment we
think she is going to faint right on top of the Baron. She
is trying to collect her senses, it cannot be true. We can
hear nothing but the heavy breathing of Preysing and the
traffic below.
Suddenly a motor horn in the street below sounds strident,
it is the first time we have been conscious of it.
With a swift movement, Flaemmchen dashes towards the door.
