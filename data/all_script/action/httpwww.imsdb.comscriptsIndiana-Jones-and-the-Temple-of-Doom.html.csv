3||"A Chinese GONG SOUNDS and the glittering doors of an art Deco pa-
poda slide open to reveal a mammoth silver stairway down which
rows of beautiful women start descending   (BEGIN MAIN TITLES)
The lovely ladies are a mix of races and they sing a strange,
haunting melody -- one might think them a heavenly choir, if it

5||"From the ethereal beauties, we cut to a street urchin's dirty
face: SHORT ROUND is a ten-year-old Chinese kis wearing a beat-
up American baseball cap.
Sneaking into the club, Short Round weaves past the fancy gowns
and silk suits, heading toward the music in the main ballroom."|stage direction

7||"Short Round enters and stares across the smoky nightclub.  On the
stage, he sees a giant paper-mache dragon laying curled around
the pagoda.
Now, the dragon's eyes light up, its nostrils exhale smoke and
its enormous jaws open.  Out of the dragon's mouth walks the star
of the stage show:
WILLIE SCOTT, a dreamy beauty singing a sultry solo white the or-
chestra wails the accompaniment.
But Short Round's not here to ogle crooning dames.  He surveys
the rich Chinese, American and European revelers.  Jewels flash
and champagne flows.  Short Round finally spots a table of
somber-looking Chinese men in suits.
Short Round chews gum and stares at the men.  Then he turns to
go.  WU HAN, a waiter with a scar across his cheek, watches Short
Round leave."|stage direction

9||"As Short Round hurries toward the exit, he bumps into a man in a
tuxedo entering the club.  Short Round looks up at the man, but
we don't see his face.
Then Short Round is grabbed by the scruff of his neck and a door-
man hustles him out the door, Short Round yelling insults all the
way.
A maitre d' apologizes to the man in the tuxedo and two hat-check
girls smile at him familiarly as he continues into the ballroom.
We notice something incongruous:  the man in the tuxedo is wear-
ing work boots caked with mud."|stage direction

11||"The man in the tuxedo stops to watch Willie Scott singing sexily
on the stage.  Then he looks around and sees the table of somber
Chinese men that Short Round spotted earlier.
As the man in the tuxedo walks toward the table, he removes a
cigarette from a silver case.  He arrives at the table just as
the chorus and orchestra reach a crescendo --
And on the stage, a glistening, muscular slave swings a huge ham-
mer toward an enormous brass gong --
The man in the tuxedo leans to receive a light from a cigarette-
girl and, as the GONG BOOMS, the match flares to reveal his face
for the first time:
It's INDIANA JONES.  Elegant in a tuxedo -- dressed to kill.  The
TITLES END and over this a legend appears on the screen:"|stage direction

heap."|stage direction
23|LAO|"For this special occasion, I
ordered champagne and caviar."|speech
24||"Indiana looks at the pile of caviar on the plate in front of him

Lao's smiles dies with it.
There's applause as Wille Scott finishes her song.  At the
table, Lao stares at Indiana with a strange intensity."|stage direction
25|LAO|"So, it is true, Dr. Jones?  you
found Nurhachi?"|speech

night I had a little trouble.
Somebody tried to slit my throat."|speech
27||"Indiana looks across the table at Lao's son, CHEN, who resembles
a bulldog and snarls like one now."|stage direction
28|INDIANA (Cont'd)|"It was dark, but I think one of
your sons tried to get Nurhachi
without paying for him."|speech

mutters and stands angrily -- Lao barks a command in Chinese and
Chen sits down again."|stage direction

table.  Indiana glances at it."|stage direction
34|INDIANA|"As I recall the deal was consid-

see Willie Scott.  Lao kisses her hand.  Willie is unaware of the

us?"|speech

now."|speech

were always funny little men

he slips the pistol back into his pocket."|stage direction
52|INDIANA|"Now I suggest you pay me what you
promised -- or your girlfriend
here is going to be squealing a
new tune."|speech
53||"The ritzy patrons at the tables nearby are unaware of the tawdry
drama quietly unfolding at this table.
Willie eyes the blade and whimpers.  She looks imploringly at Lao
and he slowly reaches into his pocket.  He puts ten gold coins
next to the cash on the table.
Indy leans forward to look at the gold coins -- so intently that
he fails to notice Kao Kan spilling some powder into Indy's cham-
pagne glass!"|stage direction
54|INDIANA|"Try again Lao -- the deal was
more."|speech
55||"The knife pokes Willie and she whimpers again.  Lao reaches into
another pocket and brings out a folded piece of rice paper -- he
opens it and a large diamond and ruby spill out onto the table."|stage direction
56|INDIANA (Cont'd)|"Bingo...you see, Lao, with a
but of persuasion, even you can
be an honest fellow."|speech
57||"Indy smiles and jabs the knife into the middle of the table.
Then he lifts his champagne glass in a toast to Lao -- who
watches expectantly as Indiana moves the glass toward his lips --
Suddenly Willie stands angrily, jostling Indy's arm so that he
doesn't drink his champagne."|stage direction
58|WILLIE|"Look at this!  He put a hole
in my dress from Paris!"|speech

lie --"|stage direction

glass to seal the deal --"|stage direction
62|LAO (Cont'd)|To your health, Dr. Jones.|speech
63||"Lao sips hs champagne and watches hopefully as Indy picks up his
glass and this time Indy does drink the champagne. Then he
reaches for the cash --
But Chen grins and puts a silver snuff bottle next to the cash,
gold and jewels -- he tips the little bottle over and some white
powder spills out of it --"|stage direction
64|INDIANA|What's that?|speech
65|LAO|"A bonus, Dr. Jones.  That is
poison.  You just drank the
rest of it."|speech
66||"Indiana examines his champagne glass and sees a residue at the
bottom of it.  He swallows and feels sick, wondering it it's fear
or the poison already taking effect."|stage direction
67|LAO (Cont'd)|"There is an antidote for this
poison.  You give me Nurhachi --
I give you the antidote."|speech
68||"Indiana is sweating.  Willie looks at him and sees Indy's hand
shaking."|stage direction
69|LAO (Cont'd)|"The poison works fast, Dr. Jones.
Where is Nurhachi?"|speech
70||"Indiana finally reaches into his pocket.  Next to the cash, gold,
jewels and poison, Indiana sets down a beautiful small box.  Lao
and his men stare hypnotically at the exquisite gold and enamel
box."|stage direction
71||(nervously)|unknown
72|WILLIE|This Nurhachi's a very small guy.|speech
73||Nobody pays any attention to her as Lao reaches for the box.|stage direction

hachi -- the first Emperor of the
Manchu Dynasty."|speech

powder inside."|stage direction
76|INDIANA (Cont'd)|"Now what about the antidote,
Lao."|speech
77||(holding the box)|unknown
78|LAO|"At last I have the ashes of my
sacred ancestor!"|speech
79|WILLIE|"So, what's the big deal?  Let
me see it --"|speech
80||"Qillie grabs Lao's arm and some of the precious ashes spill out
of the gold box.  Stunned by this desecration of his ancestor,
Lao grabs Willie by the wrist and twists her arm --"|stage direction
81|LAO|You fool!|speech
82|WILLIE|"Ow, you're hurting me, you miser-
able little hood!"|speech
83|INDIANA|"Let go of her, Lao.  And give me
the antidote."|speech
84||"Lao just laughs evilly -- until a waiter moves up behind Lao and
the crimelord suddenly stiffens.  He lets go of Willie's wrist
and raises his hands off the table.  Chen stops collecting the
money and jewels.
Kao Kan tenses and Indy smiles at Wu Han, the Chinese waiter with
the scar, who is standing behind Lao.  Wu Han has a towel over
his hand  --  under it, he has a pistol pressed against Lao's
spine."|stage direction
85||(smiling at Wu Han)|unknown
86|INDIANA (Cont'd)|I like the service here.|speech
87||(puzzled)|unknown
88|WILLIE|Hey, he's not a waiter...|speech
89|INDIANA|"No, Wu Han's an old friend I
brought along."|speech
90|(to Lao)|"So, the game's not over. Put
the antidote on the table, Lao."|speech
91||"Lao carefully reaches into his pocket and puts a small glass vial
of liquid next to the cash, gold, jewels, poison and sacred box.
Indy looks relieved as he reaches for the vial of antidote --
then he hears a muffled report!  And another!
Wu Han groans and sways.  Indy starts to stand but Chen immedi-
ately turns the smoking pistol with the silencer that he used to
kill Wu Han -- Indy sees it pointed at him now and he remains in
his seat.
Kao Kan stands and grabs Wu Han, easing the phoney waiter into
the chair he just vacated.  The muffled shooting hasn't attracted
any attention.  The nightclub activity continues an Indy speaks
emotionally to his dying friend."|stage direction
92|INDIANA|"Wu Han  --  listen to me  --  I'm
going to get you out of here."|speech
93||In pain, Wu Han looks at Indy and struggles to speak --|stage direction
94|WU HAN|Not this time, my friend...|speech
95||(smiling bravely)|unknown
96|WU HAN|"I followed you on many adventures --
but into the great Unknown Mystery,
I go first, Indy..."|speech
97||"Wu Han dies and slumps forward.  Indiana is shattered by the
death of his old friend."|stage direction
98|LAO|"Don't be sad, Dr. Jones -- you
will soon join him."|speech
99||"Indy's gaze shifts from his dead friend to Lao's sneering face.
Then Indy sees the murderous Chen giggling perversely.  Indy's
anger is compounded by the poison burning in his gut and his vis-
ion of Chen's ugly face blurs into a double image --
Indy stands up unsteadily.  Chen assumes he's about to keel over
from the poison -- but Indy suddenly turns and grabs a real wai-
ter at another table.  The waiter holds a long skewer of roasted
pigeons that he's just set afire --
Indy grabs the skewer of pigeons flambee and hurls is across the
table!  Chen fires and misses -- and screams as the skewer stabs
into his chest and the burning pigeons flame in front of his hor-
rified face!
This the other tables definitely notice.  There are screams and
all hell breaks loose.  Indiana shoves past Willie and reaches
for the vial on the table --"|stage direction
100|INDIANA|The antidote -- !|speech
101||"But he's grabbed from behind by Kao Kan.  Indy elbows the punk,
reaches back and grabs his head -- and somersaults Kao Kan onto
the table!
As nubmer two son crashes into the table, the impact sends the
Emperor Nurhachi's ashes billowing into Lao's stricken face!
Indiana yells as he sees the vial of antidote rolling across the
table -- and falling!
Indiana dives and catches the antidote just before it hits the
floor -- then Indy's hand is brutally stomped on by one of Lao's
henchmen and the vial rolls away.
Indiana angrily raises his head, smashing it up into the hench-
man's groin -- the man howls like a banshee and hobbles away.
Meanwhile, Willie watches Lao grabbing for cash from the table.
Willie lunges past the pigeon-skewered Chen to snatch the jewels,
but unfortunately Kao Kan knocks them off the table as he leaps
to attack Indy.
Indiana scrambles on his hands and knees after the rolling vial.
People keep kicking it -- he almost has it when Willie runs into
him, trips and lands on her back."|stage direction
102|INDIANA|"Look out, damn it, I need that
antidote!"|speech
103|WILLIE|Who cares?  Where's that diamond!|speech
104||"Gunfire explodes and they both scramble in different directions.
Indy dives through the fleeing nightclub patrons and slides be-
hind a water-spewing fountain.  Water kicks up as Indy is shot at
by Lao and his henchmen.
Indy sees the vial of antidote kicked again and it spins across
the marble floor -- feeling the poison, Indy shakes his head
groddily and splashes water on his face.
Meanwhile, Willie is chasing her diamond, shoving through the
panicked crowd.  She spots the diamond!  Another elegantly
dresses soman is bending to pick it up --"|stage direction
105||(acidly polite)|unknown
106|WILLIE|"Excuse me, but I believe that's
my diamond!"|speech
107||"Willie smiles and suddenly kicks the woman in the butt!  Willie
reaches to get the diamond but not before the other woman tackles
her.
Behind the fountain, Indiana makes a break -- he runs and dives
on top of a serving cart.  The wheeled cart hurtles toward an un-
suspecting gunman, crashes into him from behind and sends him
flying head first into a row of ice buckets.
Nearby, Willie slugs the other lady in the jaw and grabs for the
elusive diamond just as the ice buckets showers ice across the
floor -- which camouflages the diamond!"|stage direction
108|WILLIE|Aw nuts!|speech
109||"Searching desperately for the jewel, Willie sees the vial of
antidote spinning across the floor --as it slides by, she grabs
it."|stage direction
110|INDIANA (O.S.)|Hey,doll!  Don't move!|speech
111||"She sees Indy speeding by atop the serving cart.  Lao and his
gunmen rush out to block the way.  Indy rolls off the cart and
slides behind a potted palm as Lao's men open fire again."|stage direction
112||(shouting to Willie)|unknown
113|INDIANA (Cont'd)|Hey, don't go away!  I need that!|speech
114||"Willie smiles meanly as she slips the vial down the front of her
dress, thumbs her nose at Indiana and walks away."|stage direction
115|INDIANA (Cont'd)|If I wasn't dying, I'd kill her...|speech
116||"Hiding behind the palm tree, Indiana looks around and spots a gi-
ant statue at the side of the stage.  Indy makes a break for it.
As the gunmen open fire, Indy springs onto a chair -- jumps onto
a table -- and leaps onto the stage.  He grabs the golden broad-
sword from the Chinese warrior statue!
As bullets smash into the statue, Indiana hides behind it.  Then
he jumps out and swings the large sword toward the enormous brass
gong.
The crimson cord holding the gong is SLASHED!  Indy slings the
sword at his assailants and gives the three-meter-high gong a
helpful shove --
The giant gong rolls and echoes as it crashes down the marble
steps.  Indiana ducks behind it as it gains momentum and rolls
across the dance floor.
Using the gong as an enormous shield, Indy evades the gunfire ex-
ploding -- bullets ricochet off the rolling brass gong as Indy
runs behind it.
Ahead, Willie hurries toward an exit -- she hears something and
turns -- her eyes go wide as she sees the mammoth gong bearing
down on her!
Willie yells as Indiana grabs her arm and pulls her behind the
gong with him --
Lao watches amazed as he and his gunmen dodge tables trying to
get better firing positions -- and more henchmen come into the
club now and start firing machine guns!
As bullets clang against the gong, Indiana and Willie run behind
it.  Willie hollers as they head directly for a towering, floor-
to-ceiling window!
Indiana grabs Willie around the waist and, after the huge gong
crashes through the stained-glass window, they both fly after it!"|stage direction

118||"In a shower of sparkling glass, the enormous gong sails out and
crashes down a sloping green-tiled roof.  Indiana Jones and Wil-
lie Scott hurtle into the night air after it!
The gong rolls down the roof and they hit the tiles behind it,
Indiana holding onto Willie as they roll one-over-the-other
toward the edge -- Willie screams as they fall into thin air!
Their entwined bodies plummet three stories:  ripping through a
third-floor awning, crashing through an old man's mattress on a
second-floor balcony --
Finally they smash through the convertible top of a parked Duesen-
berg and fall into the back seat!"|stage direction

passengers are boarding.  The Duesenberg squeals to a stop and

catches a glimpse of the stranger's pale face and dark hollow
eyes.  Then the robled apparition seems to disappear.
Meanwhile everyone watches respectfully as the Maharajah unfurls
the whip for his first attempt.  He flings the whip but it flies
back and snaps  -- biting his own  cheek.
There's a stunned silence -- then Short Round laughs  at the
little prince who is holding his wounded cheek.  The incensed Ma-
rahajah suddenly flashes the whip as Short Round.
Short Round grabs the end of it and pulls hard -- the whip is
tugged taut between the two hostile boys.  As they draw near each
other, Short Round sees something weird:

softly in a strange voice.  Nobody else sees or hears the bizarre

chaise, Short Round sleeps through it all!
Gasping futilely for air, Indy sinks slowly to his knees  - his
eyes bulge and he stares at the tiny, smiling skulls at the ends
of the death-cord wrapped around the assassin's fists.
Indiana sinks lower and then feels something -- desperately he
grabs a brass pot on the floor by the handle and swings it with
his last strength, smashing it up into the assassin's head with
a skull-crushing clang!
The assassin is stunned and Indiana curls forward pulling him
into a somersault and sening him flying over his back.  The ass-
assin crashes on his sping next to the chaise.  Short Round still
doesn't wake up.
Indiana rips the cord from around his neck and gasps for breath.
He sees the assassin pulling a knife.  Indiana dives as the knife
flies through the air and slams into the wall.
Indiana grabs his whip, rolls and lands on his feet.  As the ass-
assin tries to retreat, Indy unleashes his whip -- it CRACKS and
wraps around the killer's neck.
The big man struggles, pulling on the whip, trying to release it
from his throat -- and Indiana holds fast, watching the killer
gasping for air now as his face turns red.
Suddenly the assassin does a full-blown backward sommersault
which rips the whip out of Indy's hand.  The assassin has an in-
stant to grin victoriously --
Until he sees that the whip handle is arching toward the ceiling
where is gets caught on the revolving fan!  The surprised assass-
in it tugged upwards -- and the whip twists around the ceiling
fan like fishing-line around a fishing-reel--
And like a doomed flounder, the assassin is slowly reeled up and
dragged toward the ceiling, his toes lifting off the floor.

his death throes -- and below him, Short Round finally wakes up.

Naked to the hips, Kali's hair falls about her four arms.  In her
hand, she holds a sword, in the second the severed head of a
giant.With her other hands she encourages her worshipers, who

Ram's red-rimmed eyes glare from the sunken sockets in his

up from his emaciated body and suddenly there is a scream!
All heads turn toward an unfortunate, struggling Indian begin
dragged out by priests.  The man's face and body are wildly
painted.  He screams again as he's tied onto a square iron frame
laying atop a large flat stone.
Mola Ram steps forward to the stretched-out victim and the Indian

away from the cogwheel mechanism --
Indy suddenly kicks the dagger from Chattar Lal's hand slugs him
in the stomach and dives toward the cogwheel mechanism.  He grabs
a iron rod and throws it into the gears --
the gears mangle the iron rod but finally grind to a stop.  Indi-

grabs it and swings it over onto the platform.  He looks at Wil-

Willie moans and moves her head.  Indy pulls her off the frame

bridge.  Behind them a dark tunnel runs back into the mines.
What's in front of them is hardly more reassuring --
The rope bridge across the gorge is a century old and defintely
wasn't built by army engineers.  Laying across the two bottom
rope-spans, worm-eaten and moldy boards offer risky footings.
Vertical side ropes connect the bottom rope-spans to the two up-
per ropes that constitute the dangerous hand-railings.
Short Round steps tentatively out onto the bridge.  It holds him
and he turns and smiles at Willie --"|stage direction

before he falls into the abyss!  Looking pale and less cocky,
Short Round starts out again and Willie follows his carefully.
They continue stepping across the bridge cautiously, a feat made
more difficult by the bridge's constant swaying and the hear-
stopping up and down movement.
Behind them, Indy finally pulls himself up from under the bridge.
He stands up and sees Willie and Short Round halfway across
already.  Then he hears something and turns quickly -- he takes
his whip out and ducks to the side of the tunnel as two Thuggee
guards rush out.
Indy cracks the whip, catching the first guard around the neck --
the guard spills forward and trips the second guard.  The first
man tries to stand but Indiana kicks him in the head.
The second guard gets to his feet and seings his sword -- Indy
ducks, slams him in the stomach and dives for the first guard's
sword.  He grabs it and rolls aside quickly as the second gaurd
attempts to slice him in two!
Indy gets to his feet and immediately finds himself about to en-
gage in a sword duel with the enraged Thuggee guard.  Indy looks
at the unfamiliar sword, hefts it, and tries to quickly decide
the best way to use it --
Suddenly the guard shouts and charges.  Indy decides shouting
must be the ""de rigueur"" technique and shouts back loudly -- the
two swords CLANG and spark as the duel erupts.
Indy flails and feints and the Thuggee guard lunges and slashes.
Indy finally gains the upper hand and dispatches the Thuggee
guard who slumps defeated into the dirt.
Keeping the sword, Indy starts out onto the bridge, walking as
quickly as possible across the rickety span.  He hears shouting
ahead and looks worried then temple guards appear at the far end
of the bridge.
The guards suprise Willie and Shorty as they finally get across
the bridge.  Struggling   futilely with the guards, Willie shouts
at Indiana --"|stage direction

guards approaching from both sides, and nothing but heaven above
and the rocky gorge hundreds of feet below!
A wind comes up and the High Priest, Mola Ram, appears on the far
end of the bridge.  He stands with the guards who hold Willie and
Short Round.

ropes --!
Immediately Mola Ram's guards start to flee in panic -- too late!
Indiana swings the sword again and the two ropes on the other
side are severed --
The rope bridge is sheared in two!  It breaks in the middle and
both halves fall apart!  The guards scream horribly in the air as
they plunge down into the rocky gorge!
Willie and Short Round cling to their established footholds and
fall with the bridge toward the wall of the gorge.  Mola Ram
spills forward, clutching desperately at the ropes and slats --
Below them, Indiana has latched onto a rope and swings with the
bridge as it hits the gorge wall and hangs vertically now, dang-
ling from its moorings at the top.
There's an instant of suspended animation as all who remain alive
realize they are alive.  Short Round and Willie cling near the
top of the now vertical bridge.
Below them, Mola Ram clutches onto one of the main ropes while
directly above him the last of his guards holds on for dear life.
Short Round and Willie struggle upwards, clutching ropes and
stepping on slats.  Finally, Short Round heaves himself up onto
solid ground and turns to help Willie up.
Meanwhile, dangling below on the bridge, Indy reaches up and
grabs Mola Ram's leg.  The High Priest kicks and tries to break
Indy's grip.  He kicks again and smashes Indy in the face.
Indy won't let go.  Suddenly the High Priest reaches up and grabs
his own Thuggee guard and yanks his down by the front of his
shirt --
Mola Ram shoves the luckless guard down onto Indy, trying to
dislodge him by sacrificing the screaming Thuggee.  Indy manages
to hang on.  The Thuggee is less fortunate and falls screaming to
his death.
Then Mola Ram looks across the gorge and yells.  Indy sees a dozen
of the last Thuggee guards streaming out of the tunnel -- only
to be stranded on the far side of the now bridgeless gorge.
Indy starts climbing up after Mola Ram again.  He grabs at the
back of Mola Ram's robe and pull him down.  Slipping, Mola Ram
turns and it's Indy's chance to punch Mola Ram in the face.
Mola Ram's eyes are glowing yellow and he's shouting incoherent-
ly.  He grabs the strap of Indy's shoulder bag and stamps on In-
dy's hand -- Indy falls!
Indiana slips downward, scrambling to catch hols of something --
meanwhile, Mola Ram now has the bag with the Sankara Stones.
Indy finally stops his downward slide and dangles dangerously
near the bottom of the bridge.
Across the gorge, the Thuggee guards run up a path to a small
gove of trees growing on a plateau above the gorge.  The guards
have bows and arrows and take firing positions --
At the top of the bridge, Mola Ram keeps climbing until rocks
start poundinghim from above -- Willie and Short Round pely him
with rocks which he tries to block with his arm.
Indiana starts to climb again, using all his strength.  He
reaches for a wooden slat -- suddenly a flaming arrow smashes
into the wood!
Indy turns in amazement and sees more flaming arrows rocketing
across the chasm directy for him!
Across the gorge, by the grove of trees, a Thuggee priest yells
orders to the archers who continue to launch the flaming arrows.
Indiana crawls up as the bridge starts to burn from the continu-
ing bursts of fiery arrows.  At the top, Mola Ram reaches up des-
perately for a hand old -- Willie smashes his hand with a rock!
The High Priest yells in pain and slips down to where Indy slugs
him again in the face!  They struggle as the fire burns up from
beneath them.
On the cliff above the fallen bridge, Willie watches the fire
rising toward Indy and Mola Ram as they fight.  Short Round turns
and sees something --"|stage direction

As the battle above the gorge continues, Indy and Mola Ram fight
below on the dangling bridge --
Indiana sees the High Priest's eyes begin glowing and he hisses
insanely.  Mola Ram's hand thrusts out toward Indiana's chest and
Indy yells in pain --
Indy looks down and writhes terrified as he sees Mola Ram's hand
starting to enter his chest (as it entered the victim's chest
during the temple sacrifice)!
Mola Ram's finger are inching into Indy's body --  Indy clutches
at Mola Ram's piercing hand, trying to keep the deadly fingers
away from his heart.
Slowly, Indy is able to push Mola Ram's hand away and his fingers
withdraw from Indy's chest.  Indiana suddenly slugs the High
