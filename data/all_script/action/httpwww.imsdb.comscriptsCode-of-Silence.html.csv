elevated train SCREECHES through the city awakening. As it
races north across the river past ancient factories giving

dawn, we see the complex business of bringing a city to life
in the morning.
On the Near North Side an assortment of revelers are winding
up their night on the town.
The pressmen loiter outside the Tribune loading docks, and
fishing boats are outbound through the Chicago River locks.
A streetsweeping crew moves through the Fulton Market,
Chicago's central meat and produce distribution center.
At the Merchandise Mart platform the elevated train picks up
two old cleaning ladies wearing babushkas."|stage direction
