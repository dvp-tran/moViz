A line at a time, the following quote appears over a black
screen.
Every blade of grass has its Angel
that bends over it and whispers,
""Grow, grow.""

FADE IN:
1987
1   EXT HARLEM STREET ­ DAY                                          1
A COLD WIND blows a bright red scarf tangled high on a street
lamp.
An iron waste bin is blown sideways into an intersection. A
stray dog investigates it briefly, urinates and then moves on.
A book bag drops onto the pavement.
Visible from the waist down, a LARGE YOUNG WOMAN in a
disintegrating leather jacket turns the waste bin upright and
then maneuvers it onto the sidewalk.
Once finished, her thick hands wipe each other until they
stop abruptly.
Here, for the first time, we see her PLUMP, YOUTHFUL, VACANT
AFRICAN AMERICAN FACE. It is 16-YEAR-OLD PRECIOUS JONES.
Something inside the bin has caught her attention.
Precious gazes down upon a soiled and tattered paperback book
as the breath from her nostrils steams. The title of the book
staring back up at her is unintelligible.
She pushes debris aside to get to it.
The book plunges deeper into the trash, as if trying to flee.
The sound of an ONCOMING CAR approaches.
Precious pins the book against the bottom of the bin as the
sounds of the oncoming car close in.
Precious finally comes up with the book. Its title is still
unintelligible. When she flips it over, however, the letters
on the cover, which are facing us now, make sense. They read
CRYSTAL STAIR: SELECTED WORKS BY LANGSTON HUGHES.

The car sounds incredibly close.
Precious looks sharply to her left.
AN EERIE SKID precedes an eerier THUD! Precious, almost hit,
falls back on to the pavement as her book skips across the
intersection and down into a drain.
She lays on the sidewalk pressed against the base of the
street lamp with her eyes closed.
The car reverses, skids, stops for a sec, shifts and
SCREECHES off.
The garbage bin, overturned yet again, rocks side to side
until settling, to a stop.
An ambulance eases up to the intersection.
When the stoplight changes, the ambulance motors past
Precious in no hurry. A moment later, its sirens BLARE and it
speeds off into the distance.
The stray dog returns, re-investigates the garbage bin, and
turns to Precious. He licks her face. Tom Cruise walks up to
her.
Precious' still vacant eyes finally open to see Tom, and the
red scarf falling from the street lamp towards her. Tom gives
her a hand up.
TOM
(flirtatious)
What's your name girl?
Precious blushes.
TOM
What's your name?
Precious still blushing, looks on the ground.
FADE TO BLACK.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)
My name is Precious Jones. I wanna
take tap dance lessons. Mama said
we can't afford it.

Precious sits in the last row behind 26 children half her
size, 3 years younger and mostly African American. Noise and
projectiles fill the air.
MR. WICHER -A FRAIL MAN IN A BOW TIE AND TWEED COAT, stands
at the head of the class trying to establish order.
MR. WICHER
Class, would you please turn to
page 122 ...Class! 122!
Precious' book stays closed as the other students find the
page.
TWO BOYS in front of Precious giggle boisterously at some
private joke.
Mr. Wicher looks annoyed but accustomed to this.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)
I like maff but I don't say nuffin'
-don't open my book even. Just sit
there.
The giggling boys continue their shenanigans.
MR. WICHER
Boys?
The boys finally open their books.
MR. WICHER
Page 122 please.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)
Everyday I tell myself something
gonna happen, like I'm gonna break
through or somebody gonna break
through to me -I'm gonna learn,
catch up, be normal, sit in the
front ...someday.
The giggling flares up again. Precious sneers at the boys.
MR. WICHER
Today we are going to review
Monday's assignment. Would anyone
like to begin?
The boys get louder.

Mr. Wicher looks at them helplessly.
MR. WICHER
Boys! ! !
PRECIOUS (V.O.)
I like Mr. Wicher. I pretend he my
husband and we live in Weschesser,
whereever that is. I can see by his
eyes Mr. Wicher like me too. I wish
I could tell him all the pages in
my book look the same to me, but I
can't..
BOY# 1
Excuse you?!
The entire class cries, ""OOOOOH"". Mr. Wicher looks scared.
BOY # 1
Nobody 'spect us to learn nuffin no
way. Now I'm tryin' to have a
motherfuckin' conversation back
here if you don't mind Mr. Bitcher,
I mean, Mr. Wicher.
The boys fallout slapping hands.
The class turns to Mr. Wicher in unison to see what he will
do.
MR. WICHER
I want to see you boys after class.
BOY# 2
Sorry Mr. Wicher but you ain't my
type. Grow some tits.
MR. WICHER
Just be quiet.
Mr. Wicher tries to carry on throughout the boys' unrelenting
defiance. Other students are continually distracted by the
boys. Precious looks bothered the most as Mr. Wicher's soft
voice loses the battle.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)
I feels sorry for Mr. Wicher. He do
his best but he ain't got no voice.
He scared too. I feels sorry for
him.
The boys break out in RIOTOUS LAUGHTER until ...

CRASH! A desk slams against the floor. The boys whirl around
to see two large hands take hold of them and snatch them out
of their chairs.
Precious has had enough.
PRECIOUS
Shut up motherfuckers, I'm trying
to learn something! Hard enuff
wiffout you stupid clowns carryin'

BOY# 1

...sorry Precious.
BOY# 2

We cool.
Precious shoves them down in their seats and huffs.
PRECIOUS
Stupid asses... Go on 'bout cha
lesson Mr. Wicher. They ain' gonna
give you no more trouble today.
Precious turns her desk upright and sits back down. Mr.
Wicher looks grateful.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)
I'm like the polices for Mr.
Wicher. Tha's why I can't be late
to maff.
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. Someone is outside the classroom.
Mr. Wicher waves her inside.
MRS. LICHENSTEIN, A SKINNY WOMAN IN HER THIRTIES WEARING A
DARK SKIRT SUIT enters, squints to find Precious, points
briefly and then whispers something to Mr. Wicher. Precious
rolls her eyes.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)

IRENE
Hello and welcome to our Tuesday
night beginner's meeting...My name
is Irene. I am an incest
survivor...
Precious looks utterly amazed. Her jaw drops. From here, the
women's voices are so faint that they are barely audible as
we hear Precious' thoughts.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)                             IRENE
This girl look like a movie       It started when I was about 4
star and she in here too?!        or 5 years old with him
All kinda women in here.          fondling me. By the time I
Princess girls, big girls,        was 12, he was having
old women, young women, white     intercourse with me 3 or 4
women, lotta white women.         Times a week...
A montage of other women standing and speaking follows. As
the women talk, Precious' face fills with the wonder of
seeing the world through the window of a spacecraft headed
for re-entry.
CANDACE, SIXTIES, WHITE speaks next.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)                       CANDACE
What am I hearing?! What in       ....I didn't remember what my
h
the world?! One hour and a        father did to me for so many
alf women talk. How can this     years until after he died...
happen to so many people?
CAITLIN, 20's, WHITE speaks.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)                       CAITLIN
And these is just the ones        ...I am a proud lesbian. But
that come out to the meeting.     it's the only thing I'm proud

pass them in the street and       mental institution for 14
do not know?                      years....
Finally, Precious stands.
She looks around as if seeing from the top of a mountain.
Finally she clears her throat and then ...
PRECIOUS
I was raped by my father and beat
by my mother ever since I could
remember anything at all. Raped and
beat by both.

RITA
(to Precious)
Do you want another hot chocolate?
Precious smiles and shakes her head no. Rita gets up.
Precious watches her go as Miriam and Lisa chat.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)
Rita ask me do I want another hot
chocolate. I do but I don't want to
be greedy, even if her boyfriend do
give her money.
Precious looks around at all of the other girls.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)
I'm alive inside. A bird is my heart.
Mama and Daddy didn't win. I'm
winning. I'm drinking hot chocolate
on the Upper West Side with girls -
all kind who love me. How does a
stranger meet me and love me?
Rita returns with two cups of hot chocolate.       She gives one
to Precious.
Precious thanks Rita with her eyes.

R141   EXT. MRS. WEISS'S WAITING AREA - DAY                         R141
Precious, wearing her new scarf and glasses, sits in the
waiting room holding a book in her hands. Abdul plays among
the little children in the kids area behind her. Crumpled
wrapping paper lays beside her. The book's first page reads:
CONGRATULATIONS PRECIOUS! I'M SO PROUD OF YOU YET AGAIN.
LOVE, MS. RAIN
Sheila and Ruby walk in and sit down beside Precious. Ruby
has a black eye. They sit in silence for a few moments,
waiting for their turn.
SECRETARY
(O.S.)
Sheila Hewitt, Ms. Rubenstein is
ready for you.

R141   CONTINUED:                                              R141
SHEILA
(To Ruby)
Go on back there!
RUBY
But there are no kids there I can
play with.
SHEILA
Do you want me to knock your other
eye out! Just sit there and shut
up then! I'm going to talk to this
lady before my shit gets cut off!
Sheila heads up the stairs toward the offices. Precious
closes her book. Its cover reads: Chrystal Stair: Selected
Works by Langston Hughes.
SECRETARY
(O.S.)
Clareece Precious Jones!   Mrs.
Weiss is ready for you.
Precious stands up and looks down at Ruby, sulking in her
chair. She leans down, gives her a big hug and tenderly
fixes Ruby's hair.
Precious walks off toward the stairs, but stops when she
passes a mirror hanging on the wall. Within the reflection,
she sees her true self for the first time.

R141   CONTINUED: (2)                                        R141
PRECIOUS (V.O.)
One day Miz Rain ask us to write
about our ideal self...I wrote that
I would be light skinned and small
wif wavy swing-job hair.
She heads up the stairs toward the offices.
PRECIOUS (V.O.)
(beat)
Miz Rain read all that and then say
I am beautiful like I am. I never
believe her before but somehow,
today, this moment -can't say why,
I do. Just now...The inside I
thought was so beautiful is a black
girl too.

R141   CONTINUED: (3)                                          R141
Precious turns around to find that Ruby has grabbed her arm.
She then reaches up and hugs Precious tightly.
Through the embrace, Precious finds herself facing the many
mirrors on display by the old man on the folding chair. In
her reflections, she sees the skinny white girl who she has
frequently imagined herself as gradually transform into the
real Precious one by one.
142    EXT. STREET - DAY                                        142
We tilt down upon a stately pre-war building bathed in stark
wintry light.
MS. WEISS (O.S.)
Perhaps we should begin by talking
a little bit about the abuse.
143    INT. CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY                   143
Mary looks worse than ever. Her hair and clothing are
disastrous. She rocks somewhat anxiously on the edge of her
seat like a desperate salesman looking to close a deal.
MARY

Pink 'n white baby carriage, little
pink bootie socks, dresses;
