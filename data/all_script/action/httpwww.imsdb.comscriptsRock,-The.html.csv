BEGIN MAIN 'TITLE SEQUENCE:
An impressionistic montage:
A SILHOUETTED MAN in front of mirror dons his Marine dress blues.  Spit
polish shoes laced.  Medals clipped to jacket.  All in CLOSE-UP.  We
never see him fully.
The Man puts HIS HAT squarely on his head.  EYES glint.
On the man's dresser: MARINE MEMORABILIA.  Three Purple Hearts, photos
of a WOMAN (his wife), PHOTOS OF MARINES in combat locales.  TIGHTER
into the photos, we HEAR PANICKED VOICES, EXPLOSIONS, NOISES OF BRUTAL
COMBAT.
IMAGES: Through smoke, a desperate MARINE PRIVATE who knows he will
never be rescued... TWO MARINES walk up to a farmhouse door; through the
screen we see a MOTHER AND DAUGHTER who know what the news will be...
IMAGES: A MARINE COLOUR GUARD carries a COFFIN...  Now we are the coffin
as a FLAG drapes down on us. placed into a YOUNG WOMAN'S HAND.
Now we're in ARLINGTON CEMETERY.  Images of the cemetery are reflected
in wet puddles, as the SPIT-SHINED SHOES walk past images of the TOMB OF
THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER a ROW OF GRAVES comes into focus
A1G CLOSE-UP on the MARINE'S HAT, and his EYES.  Suddenly AN EXPLOSION
and we see --
A MARINE in a jungle, radioing for help: ,You gotta get us outta here
sir, Jesus, they're all over us... ! And an' EXPLOSION ends the
communication ...
