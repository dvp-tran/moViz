5||"CREDIT SEQUENCE:
The image is in black and white.
The sun disappears behind arid cliffs which cast giant
shadows on the sea.
A little boy around 8 years old -- tanned from head to toe
-- sprints along the cliffs, scrambles from one rock to
another with amazing agility.
In one hand, he carries a transparent plastic bag.  In the
other, a net bag containing flippers, mask, pants and
sweater.
The only thing that slows him down is his bathing suit --
obvious hand-me-downs -- way too big.  He tugs on them as
he goes, holding them up... Until they slide again... as
he leaps again... and pulls them up...
The little boy is JACQUES MAYOL.
End credits."|stage direction
6||EXT.  GREEK ISLAND - SUNSET|location
7||"JACQUES reaches a ledge jutting out over a deserted cove.
He spits in his mask... expertly spreads the spit with a
finger... locks his feet into the flippers... and dives.
He surfaces a long way out... adjusts his mask... and
swims away from shore.
IN OPEN SEA
The boy stops swimming -- starts to gulp air -- sucks it
in -- oxygenating his blood in a series of deep rapid
breaths -- almost hyperventilating, almost alarming if
we've never seen this before.
His gaze is glued to the ocean floor.  Clear clear water.
40 feet deep.  And intensely blue.
Suddenly, he catches his breath and dives -- into the
blue.
UNDERWATER
JACQUES touches bottom.  Clamps his legs around a rock to
hold himself down.  Unhurried, thoroughly at home, 40 feet
under... he opens the plastic bag.  A huge speckled moray
eel appears in a hole in the rock, slithers toward him.
The carnivore's jaws are bigger than the boy's head.
The boy smiles at him.  Pulls a piece of raw meat out of
his bag and holds it out.  The eel takes the morsel
delicately -- and slithers back into his hole.
Gravely, JACQUES takes another morsel out of the bag."|stage direction

Ten other divers have waited for this signal to dive.
They disappear one by one into the blue.
JACQUES uses contact lenses instead of a mask.  He puts
them in, and now, his view of the world is as distorted as
his hearing... bodies deform... sounds fade...
Already euphoric from the vast amount of oxygen in his

to empty himself out."|stage direction

gueuse.  Closes his eyes and inhales slowly.  Then he
takes a sudden last breath, nods, the technician releases
the gueuse and in one flashing movement, he disappears.
UNDERWATER
The gueuse slides down the cable.  JACQUES hangs on like a
ribbon in the wind, past a marker, 90 feet down.
Above him, the boat disappears from sight.
He moves faster and faster... through a sea that looks
like a cloudy sky.  The light fades rapidly around him.
Below, white spotlights pierce an ocean dark as night.
JACQUES reaches them in a matter of seconds.  Turns the
brakes, brings his machine to a halt, 180 feet down.
The medics are waiting for him there.  They take his
pulse.  Check his eyes... 15 seconds... normal... the
bubbles from there scuba tanks churn the water around
them...
JACQUES closes his eyes... a tap on the shoulder, he
releases the brake on the gueuse.  Plunges further, this
time into pitch black.
Below him a faint spotlight glows on the bottom.  He
reaches it and the dark diver moves to him.  JACQUES
brakes his machine.  Moving very slowly, turns his body
right side up.  Like a sleep walker, JACQUES starts to
take the plaque off the plumbline... pauses in the middle
of the gesture.
The dark diver flashes the high sign to JACQUES, thumb and
forefinger touching, fingers extended, all clear.  JACQUES
does not respond.  The diver repeats the signal.  JACQUES
does not respond.
The diver taps JACQUES on the shoulder... a beat... and
then JACQUES responds, thumb and forefinger touching okay.
Slowly, reluctantly, he wraps his hand around the handle
of the balloon.
The dark diver quickly turns the handle for him.  The
balloon inflates.  JACQUES hangs on... lets it carry him
up.
At the plague marking 210 feet, JACQUES lets go of the the
balloon.  With a burst of speed, it darts toward the
surface.
JACQUES follows slowly, undulating like a fish... He's
getting warm now... He closes his eyes.
Passes the medical control without stopping... without
even seeing it like someone asleep.
He's moving faster now, toward the warmth, toward the air.
JACQUES opens his eyes, watches the lights grow brighter.

1961||"JACQUES is lying on the bed, he is not moving anymore.  He
is breathing loudly, as if tired out.  From his POV the
room becomes very dark and blue.  The noise is unbearable.
The ceiling turns into water.
JACQUES' eyes are wide open.  His face is sweating.  The
water level, from the ceiling, comes down to him, until he
is swallowed by it.
As he falls into the water, we see a dolphin gulping air
at the surface and going back very quickly to the blue.
The dolphin meets his group, about ten of them, 250 Kg of
muscles, swimming at more than 40 km/H underwater.  They
all break through the surface to gulp air regularly.
Suddenly, one of them, leaves the group.  He crosses the
blue and seems to make sonar-like sounds.  We see a sonar
picture.  It's an image in which the dolphin will appear a
few seconds later.  The dolphin comes up like a rocket,
gulps air and goes back down.
The sonar image appears again.  Finally, the dolphin,
locates a group of fish and starts hunting them, exactly
like a war plane.  He manages to break the group in two,
then in four, and this way, he isolates his victim.
He breaks the surface to gulp air and goes back down.  He
goes full power.  The fish he is after are even more
divided.  There is only one left, totally lost and in a
panic.
The exhausted fish is swallowed.
The dolphin slows down, goes back up, breaks the surface
in slow motion.  Images becomes pale and bright.
He screams inhumanly.
Image is white, black, silence."|stage direction

JOHANA sits down a few feet away and watches him,

JACQUES takes a deep breath and grabbing hold of the

UNDERWATER
JACQUES slides along the cable, pulled by the weight of
the gueuse.  He has a beautiful smile on his face.  He is
in his element.  Night has closed in around him.  He turns
on the headlight of the gueuse, it casts a dim light

UNDERWATER
The headlight on the gueuse illuminates only a few feet
around JACQUES, as if he were standing in a circle of
light.  He stays there, patiently floating around and
around his cable... as if he were waiting for something.
A long form circles the border between the darkness and
the light.
JACQUES holds out his hand.  A dolphin comes and presses
its body against it.  Two other dolphins come out of the
night.  JACQUES watches in amazement.
A dolphin lays his muzzle in JACQUES' hand, ready to lead
him off.  JACQUES hesitates.
JACQUES lets go of the cable and lets himself be led away.
Their silhouettes disappear in the deep blue night."|stage direction
