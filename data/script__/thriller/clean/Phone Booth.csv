1||"FADE IN:
NEW YORK CITY - AERIAL VIEW OF DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - DAY
MULTIPLE STREET SCENES - DAY
The sidewalks crowded as usual.  A sea of humanity.  People
come and go -- always in a hurry.  Oblivious of one another.
A TRAFFIC JAM -- A STREET being torn up by construction
workers; A SANITATION TRUCK loading up refuse; VENDORS
PEDDLING nuts and salted pretzels; PANHANDLERS blocking a
passerby.  Intimidating.  Demanding.  Almost mocking.
We're surrounded by the teeming life of the city as we've
come to expect it -- complete with a cacophony of sound.
MULTIPLE CUTS -- Phone kiosks and phone booths on the East
Side and West Side -- uptown and down.
One frustrated caller has lost his money in the slot and he
takes it out on the equipment -- smashing the receiver
violently against the coin box until the instrument splinters
into a dozen pieces."|stage direction||
2|NARRATOR|"There are 237,911 pay telephones in
the five burroughs of the city of
New York.  Many of them are still
in working order."|speech|NARRATOR|?
3||"DOZENS OF QUICK CUTS --
NEW YORKERS on the phone in extreme close up.  We don't hear
the words.  Only the facial expressions inform us that these
are human beings under tremendous pressure.  Life in the city
is wearing them down.
MULTIPLE SHOTS - JUST MOUTHS
Lips jabbering into receivers.  Cross-cut against one
another."|stage direction||
4|NARRATOR|"Despite increased usage of cellular
devices, an estimated four and a
half million New Yorkers and two
million visitors still utilize pay
telephones on a regular basis.  At
thirty-five cents a pop... for the
first three minutes."|speech|NARRATOR|?
5||"ANGLE ON CORNER IN MID-MANHATTAN - DAY
There's a phone booth situated on the southeast side of the
street."|stage direction||
6|NARRATOR|"You're looking at the telephone
booth at the corner of 45th Street
and 8th Avenue in the heart of the
Manhattan theatrical district.  It
has been scheduled to be removed
and replaced by a kiosk.  It's one
of the few remaining phone booths
left in the city."|speech|NARRATOR|?
7||"CAMERA MOVES IN on the irate caller in the booth -- a very
well-dressed gray-haired lady -- totally conservative in
appearance."|stage direction||
8||(into receiver)|location||
9|WOMAN IN BOOTH|"You have lied to me for the last
time, you lowlife prick bastard!  I
don't ever want to hear the sound
of your fucking voice again."|speech|WOMAN IN BOOTH|?
10||(listens)|location||
11|WOMAN IN BOOTH|Yes, well fuck you, too!|speech|WOMAN IN BOOTH|?
12||"She slams down the receiver and exits.  The booth remains
vacant for a brief interval."|stage direction||
13|NARRATOR|"At least three hundred calls daily
originate from this booth.  The
coins are collected twice a day.
This booth has been burglarized
forty-one times in the last six
months."|speech|NARRATOR|?
14||"Someone is approaching the booth, fishing in his pocket for
coins.  This is STUART SHEPARD, snappily dressed, his hair
styled and his nails manicured.  Here is a man who clearly
takes excellent care of himself.  He sports a Donna Karen
suit and silk Armani tie.
He's about to step into the booth when he's accosted by a
middle-aged man in a soiled apron who's run out of a nearby
restaurant and has finally caught up with him."|stage direction||
15|MARIO|Stu, we got to talk.|speech|MARIO|M
16|STU|"Wish I could accommodate you,
Mario, but this is my busy time of
day."|speech|STU|M
17|MARIO|"How come you cross the street every
time you go past the restaurant?"|speech|MARIO|M
18|STU|"Why don't I stop in later for some
lunch?"|speech|STU|M
19|MARIO|"There's no more drinks or free
meals until the restaurant starts
showing up in the columns like you
said."|speech|MARIO|M
20|STU|"I'm doing my level best for you
people."|speech|STU|M
21|MARIO|"One lousy mention in the Post and
you expect to eat for six months!"|speech|MARIO|M
22|STU|"I got the food critic from the
Village Voice all lined up to give
you a review."|speech|STU|M
23|MARIO|"That's what you tell me last July.
And he never shows."|speech|MARIO|M
24|STU|"I was allowing you time to expand
the menu.  Wallpaper the bathrooms,
for God sakes.  You get only one
shot with these fucking critics and
I don't want you to blow a rare
opportunity."|speech|STU|M
25|MARIO|"You the one blowing it.  How long
you think you can fuck everybody?"|speech|MARIO|M
26|STU|"Hold on right there.  I've got a
very excellent reputation around
this town."|speech|STU|M
27|MARIO|"So how come you take two nice suits
of clothes from Harry and never get
his daughter on David Letterman?"|speech|MARIO|M
28|STU|"Hell, I'm not an agent.  I'm a
publicist."|speech|STU|M
29|MARIO|Mister, you're nothing!|speech|MARIO|M
30|STU|"Believe me, Valerie's on the
waiting list to audition.  Harry's
got no complaints.  He just let me
pick out this tie the other day."|speech|STU|M
31|MARIO|That Harry's a damn fool!|speech|MARIO|M
32|STU|"Mario, please let me make this up
to you.  How about I arrange for
the opening night party for this
new off-Broadway show I'm handling
-- to be held at your place with
local TV coverage on nine and
eleven?  I mean I had it promised
to another client -- who actually
pays me money.  But it isn't firmed
up yet.  And I could throw it your
way.  Maybe."|speech|STU|M
33|MARIO|What is involved?|speech|MARIO|M
34|STU|"You'd toss in the buffet for say
seventy or eighty.  The producers
would supply their own vino, of
course.  I'd deliver you a
truckload of celebrities.  And if
they like the food, they'll all
come back, naturally."|speech|STU|M
35|MARIO|What celebrities?|speech|MARIO|M
36|STU|"You want Liza Minelli?  An Oscar
winner.  Or Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.?"|speech|STU|M
37|MARIO|Is he still alive?|speech|MARIO|M
38|STU|"I saw him last night going into the
Four Seasons.  I'll bring you over
a whole VIP list when we come by
for dinner."|speech|STU|M
39|MARIO|"How come everybody wants to eat but
nobody wants to pay?"|speech|MARIO|M
40|STU|"You can't think small like that.
Hey, you still feature musicians
Fridays and Saturdays?"|speech|STU|M
41|MARIO|At least they work for their meals.|speech|MARIO|M
42|STU|"What about Harry's daughter as an
extra added attraction?  She'll
belt out five or six showtunes --
two sets a night -- and it won't
cost you a fucking nickel."|speech|STU|M
43|MARIO|How come?|speech|MARIO|M
44|STU|"Star Showcase!  Let me handle
setting that up.  And when she
eventually goes on Letterman,
she'll announce I'm currently
appearing over at Mario's fine
supper club.  Right over CBS she'll
say that, Mario."|speech|STU|M
45|MARIO|"You're full of shit.  You know
that?  All bullshit!"|speech|MARIO|M
46|STU|That's just a vulgar word for PR.|speech|STU|M
47||"(placing an arm around
him)"|location||
48|STU|"Mario, you can't hurt my feelings.
Even when I was a kid and they
hurled certain invectives my way,
it never bothered me.  Other kids
would fall apart if anybody called
them a fucking name.  Me, I just
loved the attention!  'Shit-for-
brains' -- that's what the bigger
kids named me.  And I answered to
it.  Hey, 'shit-for brains'
reporting for duty.  Everybody
loved me for that.  I could take
abuse.  After a while, I kind of
wore them down.  There was nothing
more they could say to me.  So they
stopped.  I kind of missed it."|speech|STU|M
49|MARIO|I'm sorry I even talked to you.|speech|MARIO|M
50|STU|"I'll bet your loving wife put you
up to this.  She saw me pass by and
she sent you out in the street.
But I don't hold it against you
personally -- you still serve up
superior veal chop."|speech|STU|M
51||(entering phone booth)|location||
52|STU|"Now I got urgent business to
conduct, Mario."|speech|STU|M
53||"He slides the booth closed in Mario's face.
The frustrated restaurateur glares at him through the glass
before giving up and walking off -- talking to himself as he
goes up the block.
INSIDE THE BOOTH, Stu inserts his thirty-five cents and
dials."|stage direction||
54|STU|Hello, Mavis, sweet creature.|speech|STU|M
55|MAVIS' VOICE|"Where have you been?  Do you think
I have nothing to do but wait
around for you to call?"|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M
56|STU|"I'm only a few minutes late,
loveliest individual on earth."|speech|STU|M
57|MAVIS' VOICE|"Stu, I'm so lonely.  When can I see
you?"|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M
58|STU|"Good news in that arena.  Kelly
goes into rehearsal as of Monday.
You know how dedicated she is.  By
the time she gets back from dancing
her ass off, she goes right to
sleep.  We'll have both our days
and certain nights.  Not to mention
when they take the show on the
road."|speech|STU|M
59|MAVIS' VOICE|How long is that for?|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M
60|STU|Four to five weeks -- minimum.|speech|STU|M
61|MAVIS' VOICE|"Maybe I should quit my job so we
can be together full time."|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M
62|STU|I wouldn't do that.|speech|STU|M
63|MAVIS' VOICE|"Sometimes I think if I have to give
one more fucking manicure..."|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M
64|STU|That's how you met me.|speech|STU|M
65|MAVIS' VOICE|"I never saw a worse set of nails.
Bit right down to the quick."|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M
66|STU|"I'm much better groomed since
you've been looking after me."|speech|STU|M
67|MAVIS' VOICE|I'm glad you admit it.|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M
68|STU|"Even Kelly remarked on it when I
first met her."|speech|STU|M
69|MAVIS' VOICE|"She could care less how you look.
She's only interested in pushing
her own career.  Some wife you're
stuck with!"|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M
70|STU|"The marriage is not without its
compensations.  Do you imagine I
could afford that apartment on what
I'm earning?  Not with everybody
cutting back on the publicity.  Not
to mention a million college
graduates coming into the
profession trying to cut me out.
And one thing you can't expect from
your clients is loyalty.  They get
a couple of bad notices, they dump
you.  Goodbye."|speech|STU|M
71|MAVIS' VOICE|Don't go.|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M
72|STU|"I wasn't saying goodbye to you.  I
was saying how the clients try to
give you the wave off without even
a month's notice."|speech|STU|M
73||"A conservative businessman now stands outside the booth
waiting to use it.  He deliberately glances at his watch a
few times to demonstrate his impatience.  This bothers Stu
who slides the booth open a crack."|stage direction||
74||(yelling)|location||
75|STU|"What?  Is your watch busted?  It's
twenty after eleven and I'm gonna
be occupied indefinitely with my
transaction.  So get out of my
face!"|speech|STU|M
76||"He closes the booth up again and turns his back to the
gentleman who gives up and departs."|stage direction||
77|STU|"Sorry, honey.  There will be no
further interruption."|speech|STU|M
78|MAVIS' VOICE|"Why must you always be calling me
from some booth?"|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M
79|STU|"On account of that phone records
are regularly subpoenaed in divorce
proceedings.  And I don't want some
entry showing up on my cellular
bill either.  She gets the mail.
She looks these items over.
Sometimes she even dials up a
strange number to see who it is."|speech|STU|M
80|MAVIS' VOICE|Then she suspects something.|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M
81|STU|"It's only because her last husband,
the choreographer, ran around on
her.  She can't get that out of her
head.  That's how she caught onto
him.  The phone bills."|speech|STU|M
82|MAVIS' VOICE|"She hasn't developed much skill at
holding a man."|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M
83|STU|"You know what a self-fulfilling
prophecy is?  She was so sure I was
going to find me a woman that she
finally drove me back to you.  I
thought I'd feel all guilty about
it -- but I guess it hasn't kicked
in yet."|speech|STU|M
84||(beat)|location||
85|STU|"Still, I wouldn't do anything to
hurt her.  Basically, Kelly's a
decent individual."|speech|STU|M
86|MAVIS' VOICE|"What about hurting me?  Like last
time?"|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M
87|STU|"Hurt?  You were glad to be rid of
me."|speech|STU|M
88|MAVIS' VOICE|"For a while I was, 'til I took
stock of what was around.  You're
the lesser of many evils."|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M
89|STU|"That's about the nicest thing you
ever said."|speech|STU|M
90|MAVIS' VOICE|I'll have it engraved.|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M
91|STU|"We've been up front with each other
from the beginning.  Let's keep it
that way.  How about a drink?  Say
seven o'clock?  The Monkey Bar?"|speech|STU|M
92|MAVIS' VOICE|"Meet me in front.  I don't like
walking in there unescorted."|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M
93|STU|"Yeah, you're great enough looking
to be mistaken for one of those
thousand dollar a night girls."|speech|STU|M
94|MAVIS' VOICE|It happens all the time lately.|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M
95|STU|"And wear that short black number I
bought you from Bendel's."|speech|STU|M
96|MAVIS' VOICE|"Again?  I don't know if it's me or
that dress you like."|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M
97|STU|"Have a good day.  Make plenty of
tips.  And leave the whole evening
open.  She thinks I've got Knicks
tickets."|speech|STU|M
98||"He hangs up.  Then whips a tiny cellular phone out of his
jacket pocket, flips it open and dials.  Someone answers on

last time I called you for a favor?"|speech|STU|M
102|COLUMNIST (V.O.)|The column is already full.|speech|COLUMNIST|?
103|STU|"I just need one line.  Anybody you
wanna say was seen dining out at
Mario's Stromboli restaurant."|speech|STU|M
104|COLUMNIST (V.O.)|"Maybe you don't hear so good?  I
got no space for you."|speech|COLUMNIST|?
105|STU|"Who's asking any favors?  I'm
offering reciprocal information."|speech|STU|M
106|COLUMNIST (V.O.)|"Since when were you ever a reliable
source?"|speech|COLUMNIST|?
107|STU|"Check it out.  Tony award-winning
producer Willie Beagle tossed his
wife back into rehab again
following her third attempt at
diving off the terrace at their
plush eighteen room residence at
the San Remo.  I got it from the
doorman."|speech|STU|M
108|COLUMNIST (V.O.)|"I got it from their maid yesterday.
It's in the paper today.  Or don't
you bother to read my shit?"|speech|COLUMNIST|?
109|STU|"Louis, my intentions were entirely
honorable."|speech|STU|M
110|COLUMNIST (V.O.)|"I'll drop your item in sometime
next week.  If you promise not to
call me for a month."|speech|COLUMNIST|?
111||"He hangs up.  Stu looks pleased as he folds the cell phone
and tucks it away.
Then he starts to vacate the booth.  The phone rings.  And
rings.  Curious, he picks up the receiver.  There's a voice
on the other end of the line.  A DISTINCTIVE MALE VOICE."|stage direction||
112|VOICE|"Don't even think about leaving that
booth."|speech|VOICE|M
113|STU|What?|speech|STU|M
114|VOICE|"Stay exactly where you are and
listen carefully."|speech|VOICE|M
115|STU|I've got a heavy day, mister.|speech|STU|M
116|VOICE|You know better than to disobey me.|speech|VOICE|M
117|STU|I don't know you at all.|speech|STU|M
118|VOICE|Are you absolutely sure?|speech|VOICE|M
119|STU|Who is this?|speech|STU|M
120|VOICE|Someone who's watching you.|speech|VOICE|M
121|STU|Get lost!|speech|STU|M

black tie makes a nice combination."|speech|VOICE|M

He looks around nervously."|stage direction||

Check them out."|speech|VOICE|M
128||"Indeed that street corner is surrounded by high rise
buildings and hotels."|stage direction||
129|STU|Okay, you had your little joke.|speech|STU|M
130|VOICE|"I'm not sufficiently amused.  Not
yet.  We have more to talk about."|speech|VOICE|M
131||"Stu knows he should simply hang up but something tells him
not to.  Perhaps it's the strange tone of the man's voice."|stage direction||
132|STU|"Do me a favor.  Call up somebody
else."|speech|STU|M
133|VOICE|"But it's you I'm interested in.
You know how many people use that
booth every day?"|speech|VOICE|M
134|STU|Why don't you tell me?|speech|STU|M
135|VOICE|"Better than two-hundred people on
average."|speech|VOICE|M
136|STU|Is that what you do?  Count them?|speech|STU|M
137|VOICE|"What else do I have to do?  It's
interesting watching people.
Trying to guess who they are.  And
what they're up to."|speech|VOICE|M
138|STU|"What are you -- a shut-in of some
kind?"|speech|STU|M
139|VOICE|"You might say that.  I can't go
out.  I might be seen."|speech|VOICE|M
140|STU|Somebody's looking for you?|speech|STU|M

out on child support?"|speech|STU|M

146|STU|"Frankly, I could care less.  You
had your fun.  Now goodbye."|speech|STU|M
147|VOICE|"It's not in your best interests to
hang up on me.  That would make me
angry."|speech|VOICE|M
148|STU|Isn't that just too bad?|speech|STU|M
149|VOICE|For you.|speech|VOICE|M
150|STU|"There's ten million names in the
phonebook.  Pester somebody else."|speech|STU|M
151|VOICE|"I never talk to people I can't see.
I need to study their reactions."|speech|VOICE|M

I doing right now?"|speech|STU|M
153|VOICE|"Scratching your forehead with your
left hand.  Now you're brushing
your hair back."|speech|VOICE|M
154|STU|"Okay, okay, you got me in your
scrutiny.  So what?"|speech|STU|M
155|VOICE|So let's talk.|speech|VOICE|M
156|STU|Only I got nothing to say.|speech|STU|M
157|VOICE|"Oh, you will.  You'll do a lot of
talking before this conversation is
over.  And it'll only end when I
want it to."|speech|VOICE|M
158|STU|"Is that a fact?  Well if you watch
closely, you will see me hang up."|speech|STU|M
159|VOICE|I don't think you will.|speech|VOICE|M
160|STU|Why not?|speech|STU|M
161|VOICE|I interest you.|speech|VOICE|M

creep who gets his jollies spying

167|STU|Why me in particular?|speech|STU|M
168|VOICE|Because you're so afraid.|speech|VOICE|M
169|STU|Ha!  What've I got to be afraid of?|speech|STU|M
170|STU|"Just about everything.  You have so
much to hide."|speech|STU|M
171|STU|How do you figure that?|speech|STU|M

perfectly good cellular bother to
make calls from a pay booth?"|speech|VOICE|M
173|STU|That's my business.|speech|STU|M
174|VOICE|I've made it mine.|speech|VOICE|M

give explanations to you?"|speech|STU|M
176|VOICE|In explicit detail.|speech|VOICE|M
177|STU|"What is this?  Some kind of candid
camera gag?  Or like that thing on
HBO where the cab driver is taping
what goes on in the back seat?"|speech|STU|M
178|VOICE|"This is not showbusiness, my
friend.  This is reality."|speech|VOICE|M
179|STU|"Your reality.  Not mine, you
lowlife fuck."|speech|STU|M
180|VOICE|"Stu, you'll be made to suffer for
your attitude, so let's dispense
with the vulgarities."|speech|VOICE|M

you.  Could that be any clearer?"|speech|STU|M

to do you harm."|speech|VOICE|M
183|STU|"Oh yeah.  Right.  Can you see how
I'm trembling?"|speech|STU|M
184|VOICE|You will be.|speech|VOICE|M
185|STU|"Shit, this is a new one.  Fucking
threatening calls in a goddam phone
booth.  When are you going to start
with the heavy breathing."|speech|STU|M
186|VOICE|"I'm not the degenerate.  You are,
Stu."|speech|VOICE|M
187|STU|You don't know anything about me.|speech|STU|M
188|VOICE|"Infinitely more than you know about
me."|speech|VOICE|M
189|STU|Like what?|speech|STU|M
190|VOICE|"Like the number you dialed when you
first entered the booth."|speech|VOICE|M
191|STU|How would you know that?|speech|STU|M
192|VOICE|"I'm watching through a scope and I
could clearly read the buttons you
pushed.  I have another extension
here by the window.  Shall I dial
that same number back for you?
Would that convince you?"|speech|VOICE|M

nice hotel room with a great view.

told me to wait by the phone --
because you'd be calling me in a

said what would he be doing in any
phone booth?"|speech|KELLY'S VOICE|F

harm to somebody.  And then they
try their best to forget it."|speech|VOICE|M

I've done, there's no reason to
take it out on her."|speech|STU|M

get to you?  You claim you love
her."|speech|VOICE|M

status as an honorary asshole."|speech|VOICE|M

decent.  I never laid a hand on any
of them, even when provoked.  And I
always let them down easy."|speech|STU|M

fuck can you do about it -- up in
your fucking high window with your
goddam binoculars?"|speech|STU|M

I said I had a highly magnified
telescopic image of you that
brought you up so close I could see
where you nicked yourself under the
chin shaving this morning."|speech|VOICE|M
372|STU|"Oh -- while you're at it, have a
look up my ass."|speech|STU|M
373|VOICE|"I may very well do that, Stu.  In
the meantime, think about what kind
of device has a telescopic sight
mounted on it."|speech|VOICE|M

375|VOICE|"A high-powered .30 calibre bolt
action Remington 700 with a carbon
one modification and a state of the
art Henzholdt tactical sniperscope.
And you're in the cross hairs, Stu."|speech|VOICE|M
376|STU|I'm supposed to believe that?|speech|STU|M
377|VOICE|"There's only one way I can prove it
to you.  Hang up the receiver and
find out.  At this range, the exit
wound ought to be about the size of
a small tangerine."|speech|VOICE|M
378|STU|"And you're just going to kill me
for no reason?"|speech|STU|M
379|VOICE|"For plenty of reasons!  Because you
hung up.  For years I hated people
hanging up on me.  Ex-girlfriends.
Women I didn't even know.
Prospective employers."|speech|VOICE|M
380|STU|"I get hung up on all the time.  You
get used to it."|speech|STU|M
381|VOICE|"Or else you don't.  I worked for
months getting people to switch to
MCI -- being insulted at and being
hung up on hundreds of times a day.
The ones that cursed me out for
invading their privacy never
bothered me as much as those that
clicked off without even bothering
to reply."|speech|VOICE|M

them?"|speech|STU|M

myself peddling ""Term Life.""  I
Would never be rude to a fellow

If I drop down on the floor of the

393|VOICE|"Oh yes you are.  Can I crawl out
using the booth as a shield?  Can I
crawl to that Chrysler illegally
parked only three or four feet
away?  The shattering glass may cut
me, but it'll only be superficial.
Otherwise, this lunatic will never
let me out alive."|speech|VOICE|M

1172||"Stu's arm goes up in a supreme act of willpower.
His fingers run along the two clouded plastic sheets that
cover the roof of the booth.  It raises up easily at the
middle where two sheets join.
TIGHT INSERT SHOT
The space between the roof of the booth and the sheets of
clouded plastic.  We see the fluorescent lighting fixture
covered with dust.  The solitary object -- a cruel-looking
weapon.
Now Stu's fingertips protrude into the small space.  He
touches the gun, brushes back and forth, feeling the
roughness of the grip.
TIGHT SHOT - STU'S FACE
as below he continues to hesitate -- it's agony --
The sweat pours down his forehead and his eyes are squeezed
tightly shut.  He can already imagine the police bullets
tearing into him.
A POLICE SNIPER IS MOVING INTO POSITION."|stage direction||

Still the cops do not open fire.
Then Stu starts shooting.
Not at the police, but at the high rise buildings across the
street.
At the thousands of windows that look down upon him.
He gets off two shots before a solitary rifle shot rings out
in response.
RACK FOCUS TO THE POLICE SNIPER
He has fired.
ANGLE ON STU
The remaining glass on the south side of the booth shatters.
Stu tumbles forward, sprawling out of the booth onto the
pavement.

paid off.
