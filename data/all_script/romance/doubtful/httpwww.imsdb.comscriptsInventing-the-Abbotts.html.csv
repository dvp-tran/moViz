INVENTING THE ABBOTTS
FADE IN:
1EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET (HALEY, ILLINOIS) - DAY                 1
(LATE SPRING, 1957)
OPENING CREDITS ROLL over a TENT MONTAGE -- ASSORTED
ANGLES of a group of men hard at work erecting a large
striped ""big-top"" style canvas tent, INCLUDING: The long
steel stakes being sledge-hammered into the lawn,
practiced hands rapidly rigging the lines, the tall
center poles being leveraged upright, the heavy rolled-up
sections of canvas being maneuvered into position, and
ENDING WITH the canvas being hoisted up the poles as the
tent assumes its full and finished form.
NEW ANGLE - TENT
-- on the front yard of the Abbott mansion. The
residence is on Main Street, four blocks from where the
commercial district begins. The mature, over-arching
trees makes this street of prosperous houses a grand
promenade.
2EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY                                   2
JACEY HOLT and DOUG HOLT walk along the sidewalk on their
way to school. Jacey is seventeen; he's as handsome and
seemingly self-confident as his younger brother is
rumpled and impulsive. Doug is fifteen, a popular
culture chameleon who takes on the colors and
affectations of whomever his ""hero"" is at the moment
(which presently happens to be Elvis Presley).
Jacey stops and stares with open-faced misery at the tent
on the Abbott's front yard (the installation of the tent
indicates that the Abbott's are having yet another of the
many parties they throw every year).
DOUG
Didn't get invited, huh?
JACEY
Go to hell.
DOUG
Who cares? I'm not going and I
got invited.
JACEY
Who invited you?

DOUG
Pam, I guess. I don't know.
Didn't open the envelope. I mean,
come on, every time an Abbott girl
gets her period they have some
party.
JACEY
Oh, shut up.
DOUG
Kotex parties, Kotex party hats,
pin the Kotex on the...
JACEY
Shut up!
Jacey swats Doug's school books out from under his arm --
Doug charges his brother to retaliate but they are rudely
interrupted by a CAR HORN. They scurry out of the way as
LLOYD ABBOTT pulls his 1957 Cadillac out of the driveway
and cruises down the street. Lloyd is a well-dressed-
and-fed man in his mid-forties. A Midwestern burgher, he
exudes the status he enjoys as one of the preeminent
pillars of this community. Doug is embarrassed by
Lloyd's passing, but Jacey evidently experiences a deeper
humiliation -- he gives Doug a glance of betrayal, turns
and walks down the block.

4INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER)                      4
ELEANOR ABBOTT gathers some books from her locker.
Eleanor is sixteen, outgoing, sarcastic, and very
popular. She is the middle of the three Abbott
daughters. Eleanor closes her locker, turns and
discovers Jacey standing behind her. He follows her down
the busy hall.
JACEY
I tried to call you last night but
the line was busy.
ELEANOR
No it wasn't.

JACEY
It was busy all night.
ELEANOR
Maybe you had the wrong number?
JACEY
Are you mad at me?
ELEANOR
No.   Are you mad at me?
JACEY
No.   Who said I was?
ELEANOR
I did.
JACEY
I just wanted to talk to you last
night.
ELEANOR
We can talk tonight at the party.
JACEY
I wasn't invited.
ELEANOR
Yes, you were.
JACEY
No, I wasn't.
ELEANOR
Well, now you are. But if you're
mad at me you don't have to come.
She gives him a sultry smile, turns and glides into a
classroom as the BELL RINGS. The corridor is quickly
vacated by all but Jacey -- he savors the aftertaste of
Eleanor's smile.
5      EXT. HOLT HOME - EVENING (MAGIC HOUR)                          5
ESTABLISHING ANGLE of the modest two-story clapboard
house in a working class neighborhood. A home-made ping-
pong table takes up so much room in the detached garage
that it forced the eviction of the family car, a 1950
Plymouth coupe, which is parked nearby on the driveway.
The garage doors are open and the garage light is on.
We hear (V.O.) DOUG SINGING bits and pieces of
""Heartbreak Hotel"" in his best Elvis fashion.
INVENTING THE ABBOTTS - Rev. 3/20/96                  3A/4.
6   INT. HOLT HOME - BATHROOM - EVENING (MAGIC HOUR)             6
Doug stands in front of the bathroom mirror (wearing a
coat and tie) still singing ""Heartbreak Hotel"" while he
carefully draws sideburns on his face with a wide-nib pen
and a bottle of India ink. Jacey's reflection appears in
the mirror behind Doug -- he's wearing a coat and tie too.
Jacey does a pained take on Doug's handiwork:
JACEY
Oh, Christ!
7   INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING (MAGIC HOURMINUTES LATER)         7
HELEN HOLT is seated at the dining table. She was
grading a stack of spelling tests with a red pencil when
Jacey and Doug came in to ask her to adjudicate the
matter at hand. She is an attractive but unostentatious
woman without interest in appearing to be anything other
than what she is: a forty-one-year-old widow raising two
teenage sons on a school teacher's salary. (She teaches
second grade at Haley Elementary School.)
JACEY
He has to wash it off, Mother.
You cannot let him go to the party
unless he washes it off.
DOUG
It'll look worse if I wash it.
It's India ink, it'll turn gray,
it'll look like dirt.
JACEY
He looks like such a clown and he
doesn't even know it! He doesn't
get how things work in this town.
I thought you weren't even going
to the party?
DOUG
Changed my mind.
HELEN
Doug, you do understand that you
may be the only person at this
party with artificial sideburns?
DOUG
Yeah.
HELEN
You do understand that your
sideburns don't look real?
Doug was hoping they didn't look that phony, but he
conceals his disappointment and nods:

DOUG
Yeah.
HELEN
That they look, really, as though
you'd drawn them on?
DOUG
(swallows, then
shrugs)
Yeah.
She looks hard at Doug for a beat, then turns to Jacey.
HELEN
Well, darling, it seems he does
understand. Why don't you just go
on to the party and ignore Doug.
Just have a good time and pretend
you don't even...
Jacey curses under his breath and storms out the front
door before his mother can finish her sermon.
8EXT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT                    8
The curb is lined with parked cars. We hear a dance band
playing ""QUE SERA"" and the sounds of the party as Doug
lopes up the sidewalk sporting his India ink sideburns
and smoking a cigarette. He flicks the cigarette into
the street with well-rehearsed ease as he turns and walks
up the long driveway towards the glowing ""big-top"" tent.
Doug trails his hand over Lloyd Abbott's Cadillac,
caressing it from hood-to-trunk as he ambles by.
9INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - NIGHT                                        9
Doug enters the tent and surveys the gathering -- a
tuxedoed ten-piece band plays on the bandstand.
Despite his mother's advice, a nauseated grimace falls
over Jacey's face when he sees that his younger brother
has arrived. He is dancing with Eleanor.

They dance past a group of young men on the sidelines
(Jacey's senior classmates), they are all edgy with envy,
waiting like predators for their chance to dance with
Eleanor.
ELEANOR
I'm going out to the lake
tomorrow. Sandy wants to show-off
her dad's new boat. Why don't you
come?
JACEY
I have to work.
ELEANOR
Well, I guess you'll just have to
write me a letter.
JACEY
What do you mean?
ELEANOR
You said you wanted to talk to me
in private.
JACEY
I meant... just... we never get a
chance to be together, alone, you
know?
STEVE (one of the envious classmates) makes his move and
cuts in on Jacey and dances away with Eleanor. Jacey
handles it with aplomb but his true irritation at being
separated from the object of his desire reveals itself as
he observes Eleanor flirting with her new dance partner.
10       INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - BUFFET TABLE - DOUG                  10
-- sampling the hors d'oeuvres. He places the ones he
doesn't like back onto the platter. PAMELA ABBOTT steps
over to Doug. She is his age (fifteen), the youngest of
the Abbott girls, and the least stuck-up.
PAMELA
Hi.
u                DOUG
Hi.
She points at Doug's chest.
PAMELA
Like your tie.

sleep a bit too little."|location

applause and AD-LIBBED toasts.

Joan whispers something to Alice -- Alice goes over to
Lloyd and (despite his mock-protest) pulls him out onto
the dance floor."|location

The guests applaud their uninspired box-step; neither
father nor daughter appear comfortable at such close
quarters.
13       EXT. ABBOTT HOME - DRIVEWAY & TENT - NIGHT                    13
The party is going full swing as Doug wanders out of the
tent and walks down the driveway. He's had enough of
high society for tonight.
14       EXT. SIDEWALK (HALEY) - NIGHT                                 14
Doug strolls along the sidewalk (in a residential
neighborhood) softly singing ""You Ain't Nothin' but a
Hound Dog."" He pauses beside a rubbish can on the curb,
strikes a wooden match, and sets the trash on fire. As
he nonchalantly continues down the sidewalk we see
several trash cans on fire in the near distance.
15       EXT. ABBOTT HOME - BACK YARD - NIGHT                          15
Eleanor necks with Steve (Jacey's rival) on the glider in
the gazebo in the distant corner of the yard. The sounds
of the PARTY can be heard in the b.g. (the band is
playing ""In Old Monterey""). Jacey stands in the shadows
of the shrubbery spying on them with pure heartache.
16       EXT. STREET (HALEY) - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)                16
Jacey walks home with his eyes brimming with bitter tears
-- past the smoldering rubbish cans along the curb.
17       EXT. HOLT HOME - SIDEWALK & GARAGE - NIGHT                    17
(MINUTES LATER)
As Jacey turns up the driveway, a light snaps on in the
garage. The garage doors are open, Doug sits on the edge
of the ping-pong table smoking a cigarette with his hand
still on the light fixture pull chain.
DOUG
Three out of five?
JACEY
Two out of three. You serve.
Jacey and Doug pick up their paddles and begin a game of
ping-pong. They are expert players and fierce
competitors.

A19     INT. BOATHOUSE (LAKE) - LATER THAT DAY                         A19
The abandoned boathouse is a dilapidated structure
situated on an isolated shore of the large lake. Doug
strikes a wooden match, shepherds the flame, leans over,
holds the match to his ass and lights a fart. The
amorphous blue flame flares and almost instantly
disappears as the gas is consumed. VICTOR, Doug's
partner in crime and best friend, is impressed. (Victor
is fifteen, too.)

You're nuts. You'll never get

DOUG
I'll get a scholarship.
JACEY
I had a four-point-0 grade average
and I couldn't get a scholarship
-- so, I say you got your head up
your ass.
Jacey skillfully manipulates the volley and wins the game
with a savage return that Doug is unable to counter.
Jacey smiles, puts his paddle down, and walks out of the
garage. Doug quickly picks up a ping-pong ball and hits
it into the back of Jacey's head. Jacey turns and shoots
a perturbed look at Doug -- Doug smiles:

It's snowing -- Doug paces to keep warm. He momentarily
forgets the cold as he sees Pam and three of her girl
friends come out of the drugstore across the street. The
girls are in high spirits as they get into Pam's car.
Two well-dressed townswomen (MURIEL and DORIS) encounter
Helen on their way into the apparel shop as she steps out
onto the sidewalk.
HELEN
Hello, Muriel... Doris.
The women pass by Helen with obvious reserve. Helen is
seemingly unruffled by their distant responses. She
observes Doug as he watches Pam and her friends drive
off.
Helen and Doug walk up sidewalk (towards the movie
theater -- the marquee reads: KIM NOVAK -- JEFF CHANDLER

Jacey idly surveys the gathering with irritable boredom.
He is only there at his mother's insistence. His eyes
settle on... Alice Abbott.
Alice tries to quiet her CRYING eighteen-month-old

Alice and she rises and carries Susan up the aisle.

What's the point?
PAMELA
You tell me, because I don't get
it! Look, I'm not rich, my father
is. And I didn't pick my father.
And if I had a choice between
having tons of money or having
another father, I'd be absolutely
delighted to be poor! But
unfortunately life is not a

Jacey was almost two and I was
eight months pregnant with you
and... well, some mornings I'd be
crying before I even woke up.
Then you were born. And Jacey
just got lost in there. I didn't
have anything for him. Mother
took him over. He'd cry or call
for me, and then I'd hear Mother
answer him, and I'd go back to
sleep.
(sighs bitterly)
I should've taken us away from
here, gone somewhere else.
DOUG
Why?
HELEN
After Charlie died Lloyd Abbott
started dropping by on his way
home from work. He felt so bad
about that bet Charlie made with
him at the lake. That foolish,
idiotic bet. Poor Lloyd -- I felt
sorry for him. He'd have a cup of
coffee with Mother and me. If a
doorknob had come off he'd fix it.
He'd carry the garbage cans to the
curb. Someone dies, people try to
be helpful. But he was by here so
often that people started to talk.
It was fairly obvious that he
wanted something more from me than
just a cup of coffee. I suggested
that he didn't need to stop by
here so often, but... then one
afternoon I was at Woolworth's,
having lunch at the counter. All
of sudden Joan Abbott was standing
there -- screaming and yelling at
me to stop sleeping with her
husband, with Lloyd. I was
speechless. She was gone before I
could find my tongue.

1529||"You didn't know your mother at all
if you think someone like me
would've ever stood a chance with
someone like her. That just goes
to show you how stupid this town
is -- that they'd believe she
slept with me. That'd make
Charlie laugh. Your old man was
my best friend. He used to call
me 'Egg-head' -- hell, everybody
did. And back then everybody knew
that Egg-head Abbott didn't stand
a snowball's chance in hell with
Helen Riley. Of course, that was
all before I became Lloyd Abbott
-- Mr. Abbott. That was back when
I still had chicken shit on my
shoes and twelve cents in my
pocket. Charlie Holt was the only
one good enough for Helen. I used
to spy on 'em -- yup, I did."|stage direction

front porch of her house -- your

1533||"And talk. I never knew what to
say to a girl. Never could just
talk. Could dance, could listen
to the radio. But I couldn't
talk... except with your mother,
except with Helen. I talked more
to her after your dad died than
I'd ever talked to any woman
before then -- or since then.
Jesus, I talked. Just like this.
Just like right now. Just pouring
out. Helen would listen and
whatever I said, she'd never make
me feel bad or ignorant or guilty.
I mean... for Christ's sake, she
never blamed me for what happened
at the lake, for letting Charlie
drive out on that ice. She never
did anything but try to make me
hurt less and I..."|stage direction

of the doorway. Lloyd fumes over and slams the door shut
in her face. He leans against the door and catches his
breath.
LLOYD"|unknown
1543||"I wanted sons -- isn't that funny?
I wanted sons and I got three
daughters. I wanted a woman I

whose ears are stuffed full of
money and Percodan. But I got the
chicken shit off my shoes."|stage direction

I could always tell by the way he
looked at me -- even when he was a
little boy -- like I owed him
something. But, goddammit, he's
wrong. That bet was your father's
idea and I never meant your mother
any harm. I would've done
anything for her -- anything. I
loved her. But the only thing she
ever wanted from me was just for
me to leave her alone."|stage direction

SIDEWALK - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)
Pamela dresses a mannequin in the display window. As she
moves behind the mannequin to fasten a garment she sees
Doug standing on the other side of the glass watching her
from the sidewalk. Doug writes a message on the plate
glass window with his index finger (printing the letters
in reverse so that the message is legible from Pam's
POV); his message reads: ""I love you.""
