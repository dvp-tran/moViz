the elegance of the bird, and the haunting echo of her lonely
call... until suddenly the bird is crisply pulled under,
silenced forever.  A lone feather surfaces and floats as:

Walt flippers himself closer, wants a closer look.  The snake
seems unimpressed.  Then suddenly, the snake lunges at him,

the snake swims off.  Walt relaxes.  A beat.  But then... he
looks around, uneasy.  He gets this feeling he's not alone down
there.  Looks about, nothing but murky water.  But he's not
alone, we can feel he's not alone.
He looks left, right... then... four snakes, swimming, hovering,
