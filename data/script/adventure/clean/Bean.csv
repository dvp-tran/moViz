12||EXT.   MR BEAN'S STREET.     DAY|location|||
13||"Mr BEAN comes out of his house, ready to face the world-
He walks up the street, tutting slightly at     a 'NO PARKING' sign he passes.
The street is totally car-free except for a     very visible lime green mini. A
policeman strolls by and glances down at a     pair of legs sticking out from
under it, next to a toolbox. He moves on,      satisfied that someone is mending
their car.
BEAN approaches the car     and whips out the fake legs he left there. He then
unlocks the big padlock     that secures the car door, pops the fake legs inside,
fiddles with something     else in the back seat, and drives away at a frightening
speed with a smug look     on his face.
The Theme Music - big and dramatic - begins, as do the rest of the credits.
BEAN gaily motors on - then unexpectedly the sweeping theme tune jumps, as if
it has hit a scratch: the cinema audience should be worried there's a sound
fault.
BEAN comes to a street full of sleeping policemen ~ he goes at them at quite a
lick - and every time he shoots over one of the bumps, the theme tune jumps
violently.
BEAN looks a little annoyed into the back seat - we now see the cause of the
problem. Instead of having a car radio, BEAN has an old record player
strapped into the back seat, playing the theme tune.
On he drives, through empty streets - then JOLT - he's reached the glorious
familiarity of Central London, Big Ben and all - but heels now in dreadful
traffic.
Heels not happy. He looks to the left and sees a very thin alleyway. He
takes out a metal comb from his pocket and, using it like a bomber's sight-
line-checker, measures the front of his car and the width of the alley. He 'S
satisfied - does a 90-degree turn - and shoots down the alley. It is such a
perfect fit that sparks fly from the door handles as they graze the walls.
But at the end of      the alley, the traffic's just as bad.     BEAN    notices he's
outside Harrods.       There's a tail-coated Security Guard at    the    'front door.
BEAN watches him      stroll a bit down the street - and takes    his    chance. He
turns and drives      straight through the double doors, into    the    store."|stage direction|||

plastic tractors - and then,      stock still, strangely in harmony actually, the
Lime Green Mini with BEAN in      it. The Guard walks straight past.
The moment he is gone, BEAN shoots off again - but, damn!, spies another Guard
and is forced to turn and drive down some very steep stairs indeed. The theme
song goes CRAZY as the record player jumps."|stage direction|||

turns sees the extraordinary sight behind him...
His office is just a tiny    corner of a massive storage room, hundreds of feet
high and long, the walls    completely full of rack after rack of stored
paintings. At the end of     the room, we can see hundreds of sculptures: busts,
modern abstracts, men on    horses, classical maidens, Rodins, the lot. It's

74||"BEAN sets off into it in his own eccentric way. He knows exactly where heels
going. He climbs a ladder, like you find in a library - then pushes himself
off, and whizzes the entire length of the room on slippery wooden runners.
He has now reached the sculpture area, but    the painting heels looking for is
on the other side. He crosses the room by     using the sculptures as a kind of
artistic obstacle course. In front of him     is the Burghers of Calais, a Rodin
statue of 5 prisoners in chains. He simply     walks across their 5 heads, like
stones in a stream.
He then comes to an abstract modern piece, which he uses as    a slide   and at the
end of which, he crawls through the hole in the next modern    thing.    He then
begins to climb up various famous ancient statues, using the    mouths   as
footholes, breasts as support, codpieces as steps and empty    eyes as   finger
holes.
After a problem getting his. foot caught in the jaw of a sculptured dog, he
walks flat along a modern sculpture, then uses a sequence of classic
sculptures as stairs - on the head of a little Degas ballerina, one step on to
the bottom of a horse, two steps onto the head of the person riding the horse,
three steps and now he's on the other side of the hall.
He then triumphantly pulls out a painting.     It's the one!,"|stage direction|||

gun sound effects. He's very      happy.-He passes the Security Guard - he draws
his gun on him - zero reaction     the Guard just raises his eyebrows and yawns.
BEAN heads on through the gallery merrily - but suddenly, his good mood is
broken, when he notices 3 schoolgirls entering a new exhibition, called The
Ultra-Human Form. This worries him - and we soon see why - BEAN heads in to
the room where all the paintings are very graphic nudes, and the 3 girls are
having a good giggle.
BEAN quickly rushes over and with his hand covers the breasts of the painting
they're inspecting.
Two girls then move on to the next painting - which unfortunately also has
breasts. BEAN stretches and just manages to cover them with his other hand.
Now the third girl    heads on, so BEAN can drop the hand on the first painting -
but now has to try    to cover the breasts on the third painting, which is a real
long stretch away.     He can't quite make it, so he takes off his shoes, which
gives him the extra    3 inches. Again, safe. Just.
Now, all three girls leave the paintings - but, to BEAN's chagrin, head over

BEAN sprints across the room, stands on a chair, and desperately tries to
cover a particularly lurid example of a gentleman's manhood.

plane. After walking right down the plane, he    is directed by a hostess back
up to first. As he walks back, we notice the'    ridiculous contrast, from
totally cramped accommodation with hundreds of   children and muzak, to the
elegance, and space of First class.
BEAN couldn't be more thrilled.    There follows a sequence of short moments
from this nightmare flight.
1/ The Old Tea-Drinking Lady is being helped with her ,luggage.    A hostess
slides it into the compartment above her head."|stage direction|||
191||"OLD LADY
Be careful.   It's for my Grand-daughter."|unknown|||
192||"The next instant BEAN comes up with his case. He opens the     same locker, and
tries to fit his case in. Doesn't quite go - so he pushes     it violently. We
hear crunching cracking sounds. Finally, it's almost there     - BEAN slams the
locker door. One final definitive, though muffled, smash.      The OLD LADY looks
at BEAN suspiciously.
2/ BEAN sits down - and who should be his next door neighbour? The Grand Man,
whose name is REYNOLDS. BEAN smiles merrily. The affection is not mutual.
Champagne comes    round instantly. BEAN takes it, along with a small bowl of
nuts, and clinks    glasses with his unsmiling partner. BEAN tries to impress
him by throwing    nuts up into the air and catching them in his mouth (a well
practised art).     No response.
BEAN then switches on the noisy overhead air blower. Then can't turn it down
again. It's very stuck. He manages however to push it away from his face -
straight into REYNOLDS' . REYNOLDS looks annoyed, BEAN guiltless."|stage direction|||
193||21|unknown|||
194||"Then 'BEAN has an idea. He takes a tissue out of his pocket, puts in his
mouth, chews it into a spitball
And rams it into the blower. Both of them are relieved. REYNOLDS picks up
his champagne to have his first proper sip. And whapp! The spitball, under
high pressure, shoots
into it, sending champagne spraying all over REYNOLDS.     Not a good start.
3/--BEAN is reading the in-flight magazine. There's an annoying sound. He
looks sideways - it is the headphones of the YOUNG BOY in the seat across the
aisle. He's fallen asleep with his headphones on. BEAN looks annoyed. Then
suddenly decides to cut his fingernails with a little pair of scissors he
carries. He holds out his hand to snip the nail - and accidentally on purpose
simply cuts the wire of the boy's headset. That's better.
4/ Night. Wide shot of the plane - everyone is asleep except one pool of
light. It's Mr BEAN still up, reading.
But even he is   wilting. His eyes close, and his body starts to waver towards
sleep. Next to    him, REYNOLDS is in a total lying position - and
unfortunately,   as BEAN slowly tips over, his mouth comes into direct contact
with REYNOLDS'   flies.
From across the compartment, a hostess sees what's happening. She's shocked,
comes over and taps BEAN on the ,,shoulder. He shoots up, and nearly
strangles her in shock. She calms him down, shows him how to put his chair
back - and leaves him to sleep. CUT ON....
5/ REYNOLDS still asleep. With BEAN asleep completely on top of him.
Completely. His hand is spread on REYNOLDS' face. REYNOLDS' eyes open.         He
sees what's happened. His arm goes up and rings for the Hostess.
6/ Morning has broken. REYNOLDS is still trying to sleep - BEAN is wide
awake. The Hostess approaches, and the MOTHER of the YOUNG BOY says her son
isn't very well.
BEAN decides to cheer him up. He mimes an aeroplane which makes the boy feel
more ill. Then does a rather good lizard impersonation by sticking bits of
paper to his tongue and eye-lids and fluttering them.
He then brings out a scrunched up bag of Dolly Mixtures and does his trick of
throwing a sweet in the air and catching it in his mouth. The boy is too ill
to be impressed.
BEAN tries to cheer him up with his imaginary gun pretending to be a cowboy
and then a tough American Cop. Nothing. Then he has an extremely fun idea.
He empties the Dolly Mixtures from the paper bag and pockets them."|stage direction|||

he sees it's got a hole in it. No fun.
Meanwhile, the Boy has taken out his sick-bag. BEAN is delighted - yes,
that's perfect. He turns away for a split second to scrunch up the useless
bag, while, unseen to him, the boy vomits into his bag. BEAN turns, grabs the
bag from him - blows into it, puts it right into REYNOLDS' face at arms
length, and smacks his hands together. CUT at just the right moment."|stage direction|||

blast of warm air. Annoyingly, it's also rather too high. He tries jumping
and bouncing to get his waist to the right height. It's not going to work.
Brainwave! He climbs up on two sinks. Now the drier is blowing in exactly
the right place. BEAN sways to let the air cover the whole area. It's
working excellently.
5/ At which moment, one of the men exits from         a booth and sees him in the

where it's tucked into the MIME's trousers - and heads away. As he moves
off, the MIME touches h' on the shoulder. BEAN turns and the MIME starts a
mocking gun duel. He draws his guns. BEAN is pretty unimpressed.
The MIME turns his back and walks the 10 paces to draw. 4 He turns ....
But now BEAN decides to settles it once and for all. In a brilliant piece
of big mime, he puts together the biggest gun ever seen outside an Arnold
Schwarzenegger movie. He sets up a pedestal - opens a case ~ lifts out a
hugely heavy gun - then the 7 bits that click on that gun. Then opens
another case, and takes out the huge artillery shell to load it.

throbbing noise ... He gets out of the car to investigate.
BEAN swiftly locates the throbbing sound. The e-empty convertible has its
engine running. BEAN notices the keys in the ignition. How stupid of
someone. He turns off the engine and takes out the keys. There are several
people returning to their cars with groceries. BEAN offers the car keys to
them as if to say: ""Are these yours?""
[The following should take place at quite a speed, real drama.]
Then suddenly, A ROBBER dashes towards BEAN from the direction ' of the Mall,
weaving in and out of parked cars, with a small white carrier bag, assumedly
full of money. He wears jeans, a black polo-neck and, much to BEAN's delight,
a PRESIDENT CLINTON face-mask.      As far as BEAN's concerned, this is his old
friend, the MIME.
ROBBER throws the bag of money on to the back seat of the convertible and gets
in - but he cant find the keys to start it. He frantically searches all his

rubs it on the face of Mrs. Whistler. The solvent effortlessly removes the

liquid did not stop with removing the stain. It is now busy removing
Whistler's Mother's face entirely. As Bean watches-in frozen horror,

BEAN thinks for a second - and then has a desperate thought.     Removing the pen

free, he puts the y-fronts on his head, and wedges the torch into them, like a
head-lamp. He then takes a poster of Whistler's Mother and replaces it with
the rolled-up Tennis Ball Girl. He unrolls the Whistler and places the 4
encyclopaedias on its corners to hold it down.
He separates the yokes from the eggs, mixes the whites with clear nail varnish
and varnishes the-poster with it. Dries it off with the hair drier.
,With the now stiff poster, he heads up elevators and escalators to get to the
Whistler Room itself, all the time chewing gum frantically. Once there, he
unlocks the final cupboard with David's plastic key, takes the Whistler down
and removes the destroyed Mother from its gilded frame, and its wooden support
frame. He uses the chewed gum to stick the new one down to the old frame.
He then puts the very convincing forgery back into the security cupboard and
relocks it with DAVID's key card.
