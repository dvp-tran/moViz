BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM
Ali walks into the dressing room. Sits down in front of her
mirror. Across the room, Nikki is sitting at hers. Ali looks
at Nikki in the reflection of her mirror. Their eyes meet.
Then Nikki nods. And Ali nods back. For the first time, a
mutual respect.
All the other girls begin to pour into the dressing room.
Chatting, gossiping, changing their clothes. The legs, boobs,
fishnets, etc. Things back the way there were, and the way
they'll always be.
ON ALI. She looks at herself in the mirror. Picks up the make-
up brush Tess gave her. Dips it in water. Then applies a line
on her eye expertly. She smiles to herself. MUSIC UP: A heavy
bass drumlin beat which takes us to..."|speech|ALI/TESS|?|

1414|ALI/TESS|"A SPOTLIGHT. MOVING down the smoke-filled shaft of light as--
A FIGURE RISES into view at the back of the stage. Over the
contemporary BEAT, we HEAR a beautiful classic opera
(Carmen?) REVEAL...it's NIKKI! She sings a line or two in an
amazing operatic voice that totally blows us away. Then ...a
DANCE BEAT KICKS IN as COCO comes into view, and sings
another line. Then Jessie. Then Scarlett. And FINALLY...
Ali RISES into view, wearing a diamond studded Gaultier-type
harness top and sequined hot-pants. This song (to be written)
is a contemporary dance song about BURLESQUE with a vintage
feel to it. Nikki and the Burlesque Girls, in similar
costumes, back Ali as she SINGS her big finale. CAMERA MOVES
through the packed house as we SEE Georgia, Sean, Mark (the
DJ) and Tess, who double-takes at MR. ANDERSON (the
Businessman) who sees her and smiles.
ON STAGE, ALI and the entire company explode in a surreal
whirl of dancing. Turning. Kicking. Arched backs. Legs
overhead. Rhinestones. Garters. Fishnets. The entire company,
band and bartenders join in an all out BOLLYWOOD FINALE.

CAMERA MOVES INTO THE CLUB as music CROSSFADES with the
SOUNDS of people TALKING. Glasses CLINKING. All the
background sounds of a busy nightclub. A LOUD DRUM ROLL takes
us to...
A LOW CAMERA moving across a black stage as we MOVE IN ON the
footlights which become a MILLION BRILLIANT LIGHTS blasting
into camera, blinding us until they form letters reading:"|speech|ALI/TESS|?|
