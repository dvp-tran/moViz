FADE IN:
1   EXT. LAFAYETTE CEMETERY (NEW ORLEANS) - NIGHT               1
An empty breeze blows across a deserted cemetery. We
hear the sound of FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING, then nineteenth-
century boots ENTER FRAME. We FOLLOW them strolling past
the headstones and mausoleums. The sound of a HORSE and
CARRIAGE ECHOES in the distance.
VOICE (V.O.)
There comes a time for every vampire
when the idea of eternity becomes
momentarily unbearable...
As we REACH an old stone tomb, the boots leap up and OUT
OF FRAME. PAN UP to reveal:
A FIGURE stands steadily atop the roof of the tomb,
silhouetted against the moon like a large, black bird.
VOICE (V.O.)
The wounds suffered from love and
failed friendships don't heal like
a human's, but seem to only gape
larger. The longing to be mortal
returns, a longing for finiteness.
A beat as the indistinct figure gazes out at the night...

4   EXT. TOMB - CONTINUOUS ACTION                               4
The figure enters an alabaster tomb and closes the door.
VOICE (V.O.)
In 1883 I suffered such a spell
and decided to cease feeding on
blood. Just lie in the earth and
let time return to its natural
state...
As the WIND PICKS UP, the LEAVES of a fledgling vine
growing up the side of the tomb begin to RATTLE FASTER
and FASTER, until curiously, time seems to speed up.
Night passes to day and back to night. Shadows from the
sun and moon drift across the tomb. As days and months
fly by, the vine winds and grows in circuitous patterns
all around the tomb.

VOICE (V.O.)
I had hoped the sounds of the
passing eras would fade out, and a
kind of death might happen. A
kind of forgetting where I would
be healed from my wounds.
The CLIP-CLOP of HORSES and the SQUEAK of PERAMBULATORS
DISSOLVE INTO the THUMP and SCRAPE of INDUSTRIAL ENGINES.
VOICE (V.O.)
But as I lay there, the sounds
didn't fade but grew with the
world.
The BUZZ of PROP ENGINES MELT INTO the sound of a JET
STREAMING overhead. CARS, MACHINES, RADIO BROADCASTS
MERGE INTO a medley of MUSIC from this century -- JACK
BENNY, MUDDY WATERS, ELVIS, HENDRIX, SEX PISTOLS.
VOICE (V.O.)
And gradually the world didn't
sound like the place I had left,
but something different...
better...
As we DRAW CLOSER TO the now vine-covered tomb, SOUNDS of
the '70s, '80s, '90s PERSIST...
VOICE (V.O.)
A new fearless attitude had
possessed the world, brave and
Godless. I began to wonder if it
was not time to resurrect. But
the thing that eventually brought
me back -- the decisive thing
really -- came like a bolt out of
the blue.
GUITARS STRIKE, DRUMS CRACK and the MUSIC SLAMS OUT, raw
and dark.
5   SERIES OF GLIMPSES                                            5
Slender hands with long, painted nails, Gothic rings, and
a half-pound of silver bracelets play their instruments.
Long hair, body piercings, Celtic tattoos, and brightly- colored
nylons show a lot of pale, smooth flesh. In the
confusion of glimpses, it's hard to tell who's a boy or
girl, but they're all young and beautiful. Breaking in
on the CACOPHONY of MUSIC COMES ONE GUITAR CLOSER and
LOUDER than the rest.

Many of the references could only
be derived from years of research
in the Bibliotech de Paris, which
seems unlikely for a young rock
star in his early twenties. Plus
there are historical details
dating back hundreds of years
Lestat describes that don't exist
anywhere... except in our library.
He refers to Marius, the great
white lord, who ruled over a group
of islands off the Bay of Naples
in the late 18th Century. What
I'm trying to say here, and maybe
I'm not doing the best job of it,
is that Lestat may be the oldest
and most powerful vampire ever
documented!"|unknown

It doesn't make any sense. Why

vampires hold sacred is keeping
their kind a secret. You never
name other immortals, tell where
their lairs are. They'd be hunted
down.

Right. That's the best part.
Lestat's not afraid to piss them
off. He wants mortals and
immortals to know he's there, to
know he exists. I don't know
why...

wears a swollen bite. Another flash of lightning

wound as he sees...
An indistinct shape of a man dressed in draping red
velvet, sitting asleep in a chair across the room. An
easel stands before him, holding an unseen painting.
Lestat rises out of the bed and grabs his clothes from a

ancient Roman garb, like the god Mars, complete with his
blond hair and fiery blue eyes. Unable to help himself,
he approaches the painting, completely fascinated by his
own image, when suddenly...

Couples dance cheek to cheek, rotating like figures on a
music box. Another couple is necking hot and heavy in
the corner. Jesse stares at the patrons of this vampire
coven. Many of the faces are unnaturally pale, gaunt.

her King, ENKIL. We recognize Akasha from the sketches
