2||EXT. FOREST - DAY|location
3||"DISTANT GUN AND MORTAR FIRE
Muffled by the wet green forest.
The very earth seems to tremble.
A RABBIT
Darts out of a log, lifts itself on its hind legs and sniffs
the air.
LOBBED GRENADE EXPLODES
VOICES and SHOUTS, closer now, mix with the rumbling WAR
SOUNDS in a veritable symphony of violence and confusion.
A DEAD AMERICAN GI lays splayed out, careless in death.
A pair of SOLDIERS flash among the trees, running hunched
over and low, and disappear into the gray blooms of SMOKE.
For a moment the forest takes a breath.
Nothing but trembling leaves. Then - The RATTLE of a Jeep
Coming closer in fits and starts, GRINDING through low gears.
A Willys MB appears, CRASHING through the undergrowth.
It's driven by Private First Class KELLY ERNSWILER.
Eighteen, if that. Not much meat on him. His insignias
indicate he's in the 29th Infantry.
His face might be attractive, under other conditions.
He pauses and pulls a map from the pocket of his M41 standard-
issue field jacket."|stage direction
4|KELLY|Where the hell are those Krauts?|speech
5||"To give himself courage, he SINGS Tommy Dorsey's ""I'll Be
Seeing You [in all the old familiar places]"" while maneuvering
the Jeep through the bushes and rocks.
He drives straight for a fallen LOG, GUNS the engine and
tries to go over it.
The Jeep's FRONT WHEELS catch on the log.
The BACK TIRES spin.
Kelly gets out. Takes off his M1 combat helmet and wipes his
face. Assesses the situation.
He grabs a BRANCH. Jams it under the wheel, trying to lever
the Jeep free. When --
The STUTTER of a nearby MACHINE GUN startles him.
The branch SNAPS against Kelly's weight. He slips and falls
in the mud."|stage direction
6|KELLY|Shit.|speech
7||"Determined, he grabs his pack and carbine and sets off on
foot through the forest."|stage direction
8||EXT. CLEARING|location
9||"Kelly strides purposefully out of the woods. Pauses against
a split-rail fence beneath the innocent sun.
Across the clearing stands a seemingly abandoned BARN.
But not for long, as TWO GERMAN INFANTRYMEN appear around
the corner of it.
Kelly moves behind a tree to assess the situation.
Unaware, the Germans smoke and talk. Kelly's too far away to
hear them but he watches their every move.
They're relaxed, not as on guard as they should be. Their
Karabiners rest slung across their backs."|stage direction
10|KELLY|Bingo.|speech
11||"AGAINST THE TREE
Kelly focuses himself.
Then he shoulders his carbine.
Pulls out his dog tags and kisses them grimly."|stage direction
12|KELLY|"""And so they buried Hector, breaker
of horses."""|speech
13||"He takes his Smith & Wesson 1917 PISTOL from his pistol belt
and steps out into the SUNLIGHT FIELD in plain sight of the
guards.
Surely he knows they can see him. He must want them to see
him.
But they don't. Too busy passing nudie wallet photos.
Halfway across the open grass, Kelly raises the pistol but
does not aim it.
Just strides steadily closer, arms spread out, making himself
an easy target.
Crazy as it seems, Private Kelly Ernswiler is trying to get
himself killed."|stage direction

downright angry."|stage direction
159|KELLY|"Let me guess. Happy Meals for the
wavy gravy wellness center?"|speech
160||"Abe grabs two pieces of bread from a loaf. He looks kind. A

wet"" comes to mind."|stage direction

Finished canvases hang from the walls and lean in piles
against it. All of them are portraits of animals. Some have
on hats or clothes.
Kelly's mom EVE shows grandmother XIOU-XIOU a few strokes

attention to Kelly."|stage direction

lots of pastels, very abstract.
Mao looks at her quizzically."|stage direction

to put in more cacti?"|speech

Simplicity is best."|speech

Eve rolls her eyes."|stage direction
196|EVE|"Oh boy. I'm not having this battle
with you again."|speech

way to pay for it yourself then, I

SARAH, the night cashier, stands at her register. She's plain-
looking now but she'll be beautiful later when she figures
out who she is.
Not another soul in the store. Sarah wanders over to Kelly's
aisle as if pulled by a magnet."|stage direction

dodging cans."|stage direction

As he twirls the combination and opens it, he notices LANCE --
short and wide, built like a tank, prematurely balding, and
his girlfriend BRIDGET embracing a few lockers down.
They kiss raunchily, their tongues darting in and out of

thought it was a free preview of the
Spice Channel."|speech

bad about that?"|speech

hard time making eye contact with Tabby."|stage direction
