Gordon Stewart Northcott was hanged on October 2, 1935
In exchange for his cooperation and a guilty plea, Sanford
Wesley Clark was sentenced to the Whittier State School for
Boys for five years. Upon being released in 1934, he returned
home to Canada, and was never heard from again.
Upon returning to duty after his suspension, Captain J. J.
Jones was demoted to Lieutenant and subsequently sued by
Christine Collins in civil court. He was found guilty and
fined $10,800 (equal to $125,000 in 2006 dollars). He never
paid.
One year after the City Council recommended the removal of
the Los Angeles Chief of Police, James E Davis resigned from
office and was replaced by Roy E. Steckel.
CHANGELING A True Story                                  139.
Davis reclaimed that office in 1933, where he created the Red
Squad, notorious for attacking Communists and their offices,
but was forced to resign a second time under a cloud of police
corruption.
In the aftermath of the City Council hearings, the criminal
justice system in California was revised to prevent women
from being incarcerated or institutionalized for the crime of
disagreeing with a male police officer. Strict medical
procedures were set in place to prevent future abuse.
In November 1929, Los Angeles Mayor George E. Cryer was voted
out of office after three terms. He was later found to have
been the front man for the Crawford Organized Crime Syndicate,
which ran prostitution and gambling rackets throughout Southern
California.
For the rest of his life, Reverend Gustav A. Briegleb used
his radio show to expose police misconduct and political
corruption. He also published ""The Layman's Handbook of
Daniel.""
The California community of Wineville, near Riverside, became
synonymous with the infamous Northcott Murder Ranch. In order
to shake free of the scandal, the residents changed its name
to Mira Loma.
Christine Collins never stopped searching for her son.
The fate of Walter Collins remains a mystery. If he was able
to escape the Northcott Ranch, he would be 86 years old today."|stage direction
