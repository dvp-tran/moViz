Blue sky through shabby windows.
Run down walls. A paint splashed pine floor.    Tens of paint
brushes soaking in stained jars.
An artisan's hands - weather-worn, swirling a paint brush
in dirty water that sways at the bottom of one of the jars.
A canvas - the sketched face of a woman - blonde, blue eyed
as the artisan strokes paint into her features - a poster
girl for 18th century portraiture. (We will later
recognise her as ELIZABETH MURRAY)

EXTREME CLOSE UP: a small figure being dressed by someone -
a shoulder, an arm, little hands. We do not see a face.

Against a stone floor, a child's feet are laced into boots.
A starving dog barks , darts between tradesmen, sailors.

6||"A CHILD'S POV as the door opens. We see a gentleman in
ceremonial naval dress - CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY,
aristocratic, handsome...alarmed at the sight before him.
His eyes close with some sad, internal pain and as they re-
open...We see what he sees...
A fragile girl...around six years old stands in shabby
surroundings. Her terrified eyes stare back, leaving
LINDSAY at a loss. He takes in her features - delicate
with a full mouth that underlines her ethnicity.
She is DIDO ELIZABETH BELLE...part black, part white.
2.
He speaks quietly- words almost as fragile as she is.
CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY
Hello little girl...Little Dido.
(pause)
I am your father.
Silence. Then a tear rises to the surface and as her
confused tears spill, so too do LINDSAY'S.
His POV: a POOR BLACK WOMAN oversees DIDO from afar.
CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
(re. Dido)
How lovely she is. So much of her
mother.
(his eyes sting)
I tried...but how...how could I
separate a mother from her child?
(he restrains tears)
And now nature has deprived me of
such a dilemma.
He composes himself - feeling futile...
CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
Thank you..for taking her.
He reaches into his pocket, holds out money to the woman.
CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
You may leave us.
The WOMAN hesitates, scurries to DIDO, placing her lips to
the child's head in a prolonged kiss. Then she is gone.
DIDO is left frightened and stunned!
CAPTAIN SIR JOHN LINDSAY (CONT'D)
Do not be afraid sweet thing. I
am to take you to a good life.
The life you were born to.
He takes out a cube of chocolate, shows it to her. She is
reluctant. He takes a bite - delicious! DIDO moves
forward. He puts the chocolate in her hand. She tastes
it. Sweet cocoa and sugar..and now her tiny mouth is
filled. It makes LINDSAY laugh out loud."|unknown

A constitution can never be finite

too must its laws. And frankly I
