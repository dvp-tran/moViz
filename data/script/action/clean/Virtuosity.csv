1||"Two men bolt recklessly through a downtown street. Hunters
hot on the trail of their prey in an urban jungle.
The sidewalk is crowded with people. So is the street. Too
many people, not enough cement. Los Angeles, 1997.
Summer, probably August. 103 degrees. Heat shimmers off the
horizon. Making the sky look peculiar.
The men keep running. Passed a GUY sitting at a bus stop,
watching a television in his lap. YOU HEAR the NEWSCASTER."|stage direction|||

almost bored by it. Like this kind of news is commonplace. Or
he's got more important things on his mind.
Everybody is sweating. Including the two men struggling to
swim upstream in the river of pedestrians.
Their uniforms are freshly pressed. Their shoes just recently
shined. Hair tightly cropped. Faces perfectly shaved. Clearly
men proud to wear the badge of the Los Angeles Police
Department. The guy in the lead is"|stage direction|||

you'd still be jealous."|speech|PARKER BARNES|M|
7||"His partner is JOHN DONLEY, late 20s, eager to prove himself.
He struggles to keep up with Parker. John accidently knocks
over several pedestrians. They give no reaction, except to
pick themselves up and continue on their way.
Parker and John keep charging. Their conversation breathless:"|stage direction|||

13||"Parker spots Sid 6.7 across the room. Without hesitation the
hunter chases his prey.  Gun out and firing. NOT what you
would call Standard Police Procedure.
Bullets riddle Sid 6.7's table as he dives from his chair. He
lands next to a bowling ball bag, which sits beneath his
table.
John charges from the other direction until a WOMAN gets up

CRASH! They tumble to the floor.
In the same movement, Sid 6.7 removes a gun from inside his
jacket and shoots John in the shoulder before he can fire.
John's gun flies from his hand. Sid 6.7 advances toward him.
Parker struggles to his feet. Aims his weapon. Sid 6.7 does
the same, but without looking. BOOM! Parker gets a bullet
through his shooting arm. His wound IDENTICAL to John's.
Parker's weapon tumbles to the floor as his arm goes limp.
Parker charges him wildly, but Sid 6.7 brutally kicks him in
the stomach. In perfect rhythm with the symphony playing in
the background. Parker doubles over, gasping for breath.
Another kick drops Parker to his knees."|stage direction|||

Parker charges through SOUS CHEFS chopping vegetables, who
work undistracted. The Vegetables look plastic.
Parker turns a corner, stopping fast. At the other end of the
aisle stands Sid 6.7, who presses his gun against the head of
a frightened BUSBOY. Sid 6.7 holds the Busboy's body in front

Sid 6.7 stares at Parker in disbelief. Blood is now visible
flowing from a bullet hole in Sid 6.7's shoulder, which was
caused by the same bullet. Sid 6.7's arm dangles uselessly.
His gun lies on the floor."|stage direction|||

over something. Sid 6.7's bowling bag. Blood flows through
its zipper. You now realize the object inside is NOT a
bowling ball.
Beside the bowling bag lies John's body, which is convulsing.
His hands have been tied to bare electrical wire. John is
being electrocuted. Parker kicks away the wires, but not in

very eyes. We PULL BACK TO REVEAL what you are seeing is
ON A MONITOR
The scene continues seamlessly. Sid 6.7's skin heals over his
shoulder wound once his internal parts are back in their
proper places. No scar whatsoever.
His clothing also returns to perfect condition. Literally, as
good as new. This is known as AUTOMATIC RESETTING.
The previously dead Busboy also Auto Resets. His wound
healing by itself. We PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal the monitor
is one of several
INSIDE THE LAW ENFORCEMENT TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT CENTER
a/k/a LETAC. The facility is a converted aerospace research
building in Pacoima. Funded by government black book dollars.
The look is a mixture of industrial grime and high-tech
sparkle. Banks upon banks of computer equipment. Wires,
cables, conduits, connectors everywhere you look.
In complete disarray to the uninitiated. But to those in the
know, this is the most advanced facility of its kind in the
world.
The building is partitioned into dozens of stations. At each
station, a leading engineer in his field is frantically
readying a prototype for demonstration. Each new technology
designed to help fight the new Cold War... the War on Crime.
The atmosphere is competitive. Voices are loud. Tension,
anticipation in the air. Only a lucky few will have their
inventions approved for production.
LETAC is, quite simply, Los Alamos from 1940 meets Sega from
1994.
At a station in the middle of the room, TWO UNCONSCIOUS
BODIES lie on narrow beds wearing form-fitting skull caps
made of polyurethane.
Each skull cap has 100 acupuncture needles stuck through it
at points designated as neural primes. Each needle is
directly connected to the participant's nervous system.
The tail end of each needle is connected to a fiber optic
wire which leads to one of numerous interconnected computers
surrounding the beds.
Each of these components isn't much to look at on its own.
But together, with the rest of the apparatus, are part of
something very new —— a revolutionary law enforcement
training device whose name you read:
VIRTUAL REALITY CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION SIMULATOR
To be perfectly clear, the events you just witnessed
involving Parker, John, and Sid 6.7 took place within virtual
reality, not the real world.
Dozens of small character modules, similar to today's
Nintendo game cartridges, are plugged into .the system's main
console.
Each of the modules bares a name and number, such as MAITRE
D' 1.7 and SHEILA 3.2. There is no character version number
greater than 4.0. Until you see the module labelled SID 6.7.
The simulation timer stops at: 17 hours, 52 minutes, 11
seconds. A clock reads: 3:04:32 PM.
Four observers, two men and two women, watch virtual reality
monitors positioned around the station. One of the men wears
an L. A. P. D. uniform. His name is WILLIAM COX, 40S. His
nameplate reads CHIEF OF POLICE.
One of the women sits by herself in front of a monitor.
Intently following the action on screen. Studying it
clinically. Her name is DR. MADISON CARTER, late 30s.
She is beautiful, and charming, but those qualities take a
back seat to her intelligence. She is one of the country's
foremost authorities on criminal psychology. Her concerns are
empirical. Her quest is knowledge. She has little in common
with the other observers.
The other man is FREDERICK WALLACE, 5Os, Chairman/CEO of
LETAC. Expensive suit. Commanding, powerful. But not as
commanding, or powerful, as ELIZABETH DEANE, 605, the
Presidentially—appointed Crime Czars
Elizabeth Deane is solely responsible for the funds allocated
to LETAC. As well as which prototypes will move on to
production."|stage direction|||

46||"LAB ASSISTANTS remove the polyurethane skull caps from the
two unconscious bodies. The acupuncture needles remain in the
caps. You can now see the faces of the participants:
Parker and John.
Parker lies calmly, his eyes fluttering as he gradually
returns to consciousness. He looks very different than his
virtual rendering:
His hair is long and ragged. His face is unshaven. A scar
across his cheek. A hoop earring in one ear. His outfit a
filthy prison uniform.
John's outfit matches Parker's. Physically, he looks as
clean—cut as his virtual rendering. Except that he is
convulsing. Violently.
His flailing appendages repeatedly hit the apparatus around
him. Like an epileptic having a grand mal seizure. It's ugly.
Frightening."|stage direction|||

paramedics inject him. Fibrillate him. Repeatedly.
The simulator's designer, DARYL LINDENMEYER, 40s, high—
strung, intense, and brilliant beyond words, stands by the
equipment protectively. He is far more concerned for the
safety of his machines than he is for John's life.
John's body goes limp. His vital signs flat. The Paramedics
record the time of death and cover the body with a sheet.
They begin to assemble a gurney to wheel him out."|stage direction|||

stitched lapel, his gold watch, and his diamond-studded
cufflinks, she exits. Wallace follows after her quickly. You
now notice that the chair Dr. Madison Carter had occupied is
now empty. She left a while ago.

Parker is six inches shorter and 60 pounds lighter than Red.

From both newspaper ARTICLES and news FOOTAGE, the following

Grimes was an expert at media manipulation. He delighted in
publicly humiliating anyone who stood in his way. The Mayor
of Los Angeles, Bob Bennett, who offered increasingly higher
rewards for Grimes' capture, was Grimes' primary nemesis.
L.A.P.D. Special Investigations Division Officer Parker
Barnes managed to stop Grimes from killing Mayor Bennett.
Grimes retaliated by repeatedly humiliating Parker with false
leads and lawsuits.

pinned to her clothing. The note reads: ""HEY, PARKER, THIS
ONE'S FOR YOU.""

Pandemonium erupts throughout the Hollywood Bowl. Audience

The members of the orchestra bolt for their very lives, but
keep their instruments with them. Even the oboist.

Madison crumples to the street.
