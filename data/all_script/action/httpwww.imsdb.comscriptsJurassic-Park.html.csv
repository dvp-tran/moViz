as THE CAMERA EXAMINES air bubbles and crystalline patterns.
MOVING UP AND OVER this amber abstraction, the CAMERA FINDS unusual
shapes and imperfections caught in the glassy stone:  flecks of dirt,
hairs, cracks.  STILL MOVING.  STARBURSTS OF LIGHT ricochet off the
different surfaces of the stones.
CAMERA TURNS along a creamy stretch of amber.  IT TURNS IN DEEPER,
abstracting the picture further only to find A TINY BLUR that suddenly
RACKS INTO FOCUS - a bug, a mosquito lodged within an amber tomb.  It is
folded on its back.

drill continues, stopping just before it touches the tiny body.
A SHINY PAIR of thin needle-nose pliers reach in the borehole and
extricate the mosquito remains.  These are dropped on a brightly lit
glass slide.  A conveyor belt starts, and the slide moves along.
arriving under a long-lensed microscope.
IN MICROSCOPIC PERSPECTIVE, a thin needle pierces the bug and delicately
removes a fragment of tissue.
PINCERS snare the fragment, dropping it into a narrow tube.  The tube
SPINS, faster and faster until it is a BLUR on the screen.
THE SCREEN FLOODS with an INFRA-RED LIGHT.  Gray, oval shapes rock in a
neutral mist."|stage direction

Lodged in the cracked earth are the partially-exposed fossilized remains
of A VELOCIRAPTER, a carnivorous dinosaur.  WIDEN OUT to a SWEEPI
NG
PANORAMA of a dinosaur dig, a major excavation filled with workers
shoveling earth and stone, making measurements, taking photographs,
scribbling notes, and conferring with each other.
The center of all this activity is one man.  In a roped-off area that
circumscribes the exposed bones of the raptor, is DR. ALAN GRANT, head
paleontologist.  Good-looking, late 30's, with a think beard.
Grant lies on his belly, completely absorbed in a small piece of bone.
A GROUP OF TWELVE STUDENTS, notebooks in hand, await his next sentence.
CLOSE ON - the tiny bone.  Grant's nose touches it.
Grant brushes the bone with a toothbrush.  Then he decides on a quicker
way to clean it.  He licks it.  Excited by his discovery, he gets to his
feet and addresses his students, who listen raptly."|stage direction

12||"Grant looks up.
DR. ELLIE SATTLER, late 20's, sharp-eyed, tough if she wants to be, runs
like a gazelle across the arid land.  Exuberant, she leaves a trail of
dust behind her.
She zips by A STUDENT guarding the cordoned area.  He tries to stop her."|stage direction

20|ELLIE|"Right as rain, Ellie.  Now, why did she
jump?"|speech
21||No answer.  Ellie gives it a try.|stage direction
22|ELLIE|"A defensive posture against a vicious,
blood-thirsty T-Rex?"|speech
23||(nodding)|unknown
24|GRANT|"Perhaps.  Or maybe to select the smaller,
more tender leaves in the higher branches
with which to suckle her young?"|speech
25||Ellie jumps up.|stage direction
26|ELLIE|I bet is was a mating ritual.|speech
27||Students laugh.  One student eyes Grant's self-conscious smile at Ellie.|stage direction
28|GRANT|"The science of paleontology can't answer
these questions.  Novelists and artists
who dream a vision of the Jurassic period
can attempt these questions with their
imaginations.  What we scientists can say
is considering the mass and kinetic

we're late.  There's the car."|speech
33||"She points.  On the horizon, a limousine speeds toward them, leaving a
dusty wake.
Grant sets the rules for his departure, giving instructions individually
as Ellie pulls him away, carrying their bags."|stage direction
34|GRANT|"Jim, you keep making up the plaster
batches.  Whatever ratio you're using,
it's perfect.  Nora, no digging after
five - when the temperature drops, those
bones are just too brittle.  Bill, I
don't want any tourists walking over my
raptor - I don't care if the Governor of
Montana is with them, just you guys."|speech
35||Grant and Ellie continue walking.  She interrupts his continued barrage.|stage direction

thousand dollars to observe some resort

55|MOUTH|Five hundred thousand is peanuts!|speech
56||"He tosses another peanut and misses his open mouth.  This is DENNIS
NEDRY, a 40 year old computer programmer.  He's fat, with greasy hair
and a permanently wrinkled suit.  His slovenly looks are wildly out of
place on the rich leather sofa where he reclin
es.
Across a gleaming granite coffee table is BILL BAKER, businessman.  A
smooth meticulous dresser, Baker is disgusted by Nedry's sloppy
appearance and voracious consumption of food and drink.
Nedry finishes a coke.  Over his shoulder is an impressive skyline view."|stage direction

59|NEDRY|You think I'm a scumbag, I know.|speech
60||"Nedry chuckles, lines up three peanuts on the table.  One after the
other, he throws them in the air.  He gulps down two, misses one. It
skids across the glossy floor.
Baker's head involuntarily cocks as he looks disgustedly at Nedry."|stage direction
61|NEDRY|"Look pal, you make a career in biogenetic
industrial espionage, and you're bound to
run across a scumbag or two.  Guaranteed!
Part of the job description.  Look, who's
to say, who is the real scumbag?  After
all, I know what you guys need so bad.
I've heard of reverse engineering."|speech
62||As Nedry continues he shovels nuts into his mouth and CHOMPS and SPEAKS.|stage direction
63|NEDRY|"Let the other guy put in all the work,
all the R and D.  You take the finished
product, work backwards, breaking it down
to reveal its genetic code.  Presto!  In
a few measly months you have know-how
that took researchers ten years to
determine.  You know how much Hammond has
invested of his own personal wealth?
Over five billion dollars!  And if you
guys get the jump on his - in no time,
the market's wide-open."|speech
64||Nedry starts the LAUGH as he EATS and TALKS.|stage direction
65|NEDRY|"But, boy, he's really got his product!
Oh yes siree, massive, gargantuan, money-
making, never-heard-of-profit-like-that
product.  It is a sight!  Yes, indeedy!"|speech
66||"Nedry LAUGH
S explosively.  He begins to choke, COUGHING and GASPING.
Baker is repulsed.  He stares out the window as the sun sets.
Nedry, in true distress, clutches his own throat.  He clumsily runs
toward Baker, toppling chairs as he goes.  Nedry grabs Baker's hand and
squeezes it tightly, imploring Baker for help.  Baker coolly shakes his
hand loose and shoves Nedry to the floor.  Baker looks down at the prone
and desperate Nedry."|stage direction
67|BAKER|"Scumbag.  We have a deal.  That deal is
not open to renegotiation.  Or even re-
evaluation."|speech

69|BAKER|The deal stands.  Take it or leave it.|speech
70||Baker glances at his watch.|stage direction
71|BAKER|I'll give you a few minutes to decide.|speech
72||"Nedry makes a superhuman effort just to nod his head.  Baker nods back
and SLAMS his fist into Nedry's solar plexus.  It works.
Nedry sucks in a huge gulp of air.  He sits up
, rubbing his belly.  As
Baker leaves the room:"|stage direction
73|BAKER|"Make sure the eggs are on that supply

DONALD GENNARO, handsome,  meticulously dressed, paces the highly
polished, glassy corner suite.  His boss, ROSS, is seated.  He's a
powerful black man who waves a prosthetic arm."|stage direction
75|ROSS|"We can't trust Hammond anymore.  He's
under too much pressure.  There's the
EPA, he's behind schedule, and the in-
vestors are getting nervous.  There have
been too many rumors, too many accidents.
We can't screw around with this."|speech

site inspections every week for the next
three weeks."|speech

80|ROSS|You know him.  Do you believe him?|speech
81||GENNARO|unknown
82|ROSS|"No, I don't.  I spent a lot of time with
him five years ago when we raised the
capital.  And it was a wild ride.  He's
unpredictable, a dreamer."|speech
83|ROSS|"Potentially dangerous.  We should never
have gotten involved.  What's our position?"|speech
84|GENNARO|The firm owns five percent.|speech
85|ROSS|General or limited?|speech
86|GENNARO|General.|speech
87|ROSS|We should have never done that.|speech
88|GENNARO|"It seemed wise at the time.  We all
wanted the park to happen.  It was in
lieu of fees."|speech
89||In any case, I agree an inspection is|unknown
90|ROSS|overdue.  Who are your site experts?|speech
91||Gennaro tosses a list on Ross' desk.  He check it out.|stage direction
92|ROSS|Will they tell the truth?|speech
93|GENNARO|"I think so.  That guy Grant's a hotshot
in his field, always goes his own way -"|speech
94|ROSS|- Good.  You're making all the arrangements?|speech
95|GENNARO|"Hammond asked to place the calls himself.
I think he wants to pretend the park is
not in trouble.  That it's just a social
invitation, showing off the island."|speech
96|ROSS|"All right ... Good.  But let's be very
clear about one thing.  I don't know how
bad this situation actually is, Donald.
But if there's a problem on that island -
don't be afraid to screw Hammond and burn
Jurassic Park to the ground."|speech

awkwardly with Ross and leaves.  Ross paces.  Fed-
up, he whispers to himself."|stage direction

CAMERA MOVES IN on spinning globe as we HEAR the ROTOR BLADES of a
helicopter and DISSOLVE TO:
INT/EXT  HELICOPTER IN SKY - DAWN
On the helicopter tail is a little blue logo that reads: Isla Nublar.
INSIDE, Grant, Ellie and Gennaro are in the right back row.  Ellie
dozes, her head occasionally dropping onto Grant's shoulder, to his
discomfort.  Gennaro looks at papers, trying not to look through the
clear plexi-bubble at their feet.  Next to THE PILOT, Nedry chews a
candy bar.  He offers candy to the back row.
Grant loses himself, looking out the window.
GRANT'S POV - the aquamarine blue of the ocean.  Below the waters there
are the shadows of ample marine life.  Dolphins leap in the air.
Suddenly the clear scene becomes obscured by clouds.
There is turbulence.  Ellie wakes, glances at Grant, then out the
window.
There is mist and she absently traces her finger in it, shaping
a dinosaur figure.  Now land comes into view and for a moment, the
island below them eerily fits right into her doodling."|stage direction
100|PILOT|"That's Isla Nublar.  Buckle up, the
descent is a little hairy."|speech
101||"Gennaro cinches his belt tightly and half-shuts his eyes.  Nedry takes
out a sandwich and cockily loosens his belt.  Ellie looks every way."|stage direction
102|ELLIE|This is exciting!|speech
103|GRANT|What is, Ellie?  Where are we going?|speech
104||"Grant looks out his window. The helicopter rushes forward, low to the
water.  Ahead, Grant sees the island, rugged and craggy, rising sharply"|stage direction
105|GRANT|Looks like Alcatraz.|speech
106||The pilot coughs and rubs his goggles with the back of his hand.|stage direction
107|PILOT|There's bad wind shear on this peak.|speech
108||"Grant nods.  Gennaro sweats, watching the pilot tighten his own belt.

111|ELLIE|How the hell is he landing this thing?|speech
112||"No answer.  Grant dimly discerns green branches of pine trees through
the mist.  Some are very close.  Ellie's hands grasps her seat cushion."|stage direction
113|ELLIE|This is not fun.|speech
114||"Grant looks through the plexi-bubble at his feet.  He sees the giant
glowing fluorescent cross below.  Lights FLASH at corners of the cross."|stage direction
115|GRANT|"Relax, Ellie.  I'm sure they wouldn't
land if it weren't safe."|speech
116||"The copter suddenly SHAKES violently.  Ellie grabs Grant's hand.
Gennaro sits straight up, eyes squeezed shut."|stage direction
117|GRANT|"Gennaro?  This guy knows what he's doing,
Right?  Hey, Gennaro?  I'm talking to you!"|speech
118||"Another violent shake.  Grant squeezes Ellie's hand back.
CLOSEUP - Nedry's hand crushes a
packet of crackers.
Gennaro is soaked.  He opens one eye and looks about, very frightened.
He speaks a mantra."|stage direction
119|GENNARO|No problem.  Relax, relax.|speech
120||"The pilot whispers to himself and corrects slightly.  The copter sails
sharply the other way."|stage direction
121|GRANT AND ELLIE|Whoa!!!!|speech
122||"CLOSE ON - the pilot jerks back the stick.
THE COPTER zooms upward.  Grant's beverage flips to the ground, pours
across the floor.
Nedry's lunch does flying.  Sandwich, candy, and cracker crumbs hang
suspended in the air.  Now it all FREE-FALLS onto Nedry's lap.
Grant and Ellie lean tightly into each other,"|stage direction
123|ELLIE|I don't like this feeling ...|speech
124||"The pilot swings his gaze, left then right, looking at the pine forest.
Trees are close, then far, then close.  The helicopter drops rapidly.
Ellie and Grant shut their eyes.  They brace themselves for the worst.
IN AND OUT OF THE MIST, the copter descends.  Tail raised high, nose
low, fo
r a moment it looks like a strange bug-eyes prehistoric animal
bucking in its pen.  In a flash, it corrects itself.  The copter touches
down on a heli-pad.  The SOUND of the rotors fades and dies.
For a second, no one moves.  Grant lets out a great sigh of relief.
Gennaro mouths a silent prayer.  The pilot stretches his fingers.
Grant and Ellie self-consciously shake their hands free of each other.
Nedry unbuckles and laughs as he brushes off his lap.  He turns:"|stage direction
125|NEDRY|Just think, Gennaro -|speech

they dig up dinosaurs!  It's wonderful,
isn't it?"|speech
128||Nedry pats Grant on his shoulder.|stage direction
129|NEDRY|Dr. Bones, you're going to love this place.|speech
130||"Nedry bursts out laughing again as he heads out the helicopter door.
A smile comes across Gennaro's face.  As he smiles he motions with his
hands he doesn't mean any harm.  Grant and Ellie stare at him."|stage direction
131||PILOT|unknown
132|NEDRY|"Come on folks.  Gotta get back, there's a
storm alert."|speech
133||"ROTORS TURN.  OUTSIDE, a man reaches the copter.  He wears a baseball
cap over short red hair and he's dressed in phony safari garb.  He
shakes Gennaro's hand.  This is ED REGIS, 35, head of Public Relations.
He throws open the copter door next to Grant.  Big, cheerful smile."|stage direction
134|REGIS|"Hi!  Ed Regis.  Real big welcome to Isla
Nublar, Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler.  Little
tough landing here, I know.  But you did
it!  Come on down, we're so happy to have
you.  Now, watch your step."|speech
135||"Ellie and Grant jump into the world of Jurassic Park.
EXT  LUSH TROPICAL FOREST - MORNING
Grant takes in the beautiful tropical terrain.  This place is the
opposite of the Badlands.  There is elaborate planting everywhere:
huge, hairy ferns; exotic, spiked flowers; berries of every color;
rushing vines.  Peeking through the thick greenery are beautiful birds
a
nd flying squirrels.  The strange, prehistoric world impresses Grant
and Ellie.  Even Nedry and Gennaro take in the vegetal wonder.
Then, the SOUND of men working, grunting from exertion.  Ahead, Muldoon
directs A GROUP OF WORKMEN.  Flame-throwers roar and machetes fight back
the abundant foliage.  As they attack a new area, Regis waves Muldoon
over.  Muldoon has a pronounced limp as he walks over to join them."|stage direction

144|GRANT|Hammond's trademark.|speech
145||"A distinct HOOTING in the distance.  Then a loud TRUMPETING.  Grant and
Ellie stop.  Nedry doesn't look up.  Regis flashes his salesman's smile."|stage direction

147||"They pass a crude sign nailed to a tree:  Welcome to Jurassic Park.
Grant cringes at the sign.  Ellie nudges him to loosen up."|stage direction

exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting."|speech
149|NEDRY|Nope.|speech
150||"Gennaro wipes his brow.  They enter a green tunnel of over-arching palm
that leads to the
VISITOR'S CENTER, a modern complex in the distance.
Ellie notices a large fence hidden in the brush.  She nudges Grant.
THEIR POV - CAMERA SLOWLY CLIMBS a fifteen foot high chain-link fence.
The needle-spiked top of this fence cuts deep into the brush.
This fence is only the prelude.
Sprawling massively above and behind it is a thirty foot high fence.
Woven throughout the fence's mesh is an intricate system of electrical
wire.  There is a prominent warning:  DANGER!  ELECTRIC FENCE: TEN
THOUSAND VOLTS - KEEP OFF!
CAMERA KEEPS CLIMBING to the top:  ominous barbed wire, curled into the
highest growth with coiled razors glistening in the sun.
Grant strains to understand.  The quickens his steps to catch the others.
They reach a clearing with an unfinished brick sidewalk and potted shade
trees waiting for planting.  A crosshatching of tiny lizards scamper off
the walk.  An empty swimming pool is being filled by A MAN with a pumper
truck.  Next to him, WORKERS water the large ferns."|stage direction

Above, MASKED WORKERS weld it on.  Sparks fly.
Grant stares up at it, thinking.  Footsteps echo behind him as Regis,
Ellie, Gennaro, and Nedry look around the unfinished building.
The Visitor's Center is two stories high, a lot of glass with exposed
girders and supports.  It's incomplete:  vines swing in the breeze where
the back wall will go and undressed cables litter the floor.  Even so,
exhibit areas are in varying stages of completion.  Behind, SEVERAL

160||"Regis smiles apologetically and pushes open a large window on one of the
finished walls.  Giant leaves and vines burst inside.
Grant studies an exhibit in progress entitled When Dinosaurs Rules the

SLAMS his hand against it, and finally, a cup drops down the chute.
Upside-down.  It pours.  Coke splashes Nedry.  He curses and exits.
THE ROTUNDA - Ellie pulls Grant over to a raised, round display with a
catwalk.  In this unfinished display, a skeletal T-Rex and a Raptor are
locked in combat.  Scaffolding is up around it, and painting supplies
are scattered all around.

INT  GARAGE - NIGHT
Several electric land cruisers are stored in this shadowy room.  There
is a glassed-in area where Muldoon's weapons are stored:  assault
rifles, tasers, tear gas canisters.
To the side of the garage s Muldoon's red jeep.  In the passenger side
of the front seat is a rocket launcher.
Nedry storms in, wheeling his incubator.  He stop suddenly and listens.
Approaching FOOTSTEPS."|stage direction
598|NEDRY|Oh, shit!|speech
599||"INT  BASEMENT STAIRS, VISITOR'S CENTER -
Muldoon runs down a long corridor, stop with a skid and yanks open the
door to the garage.  He runs out.  His boots RESOUND on the concrete.
BACK ON - NEDRY'S PANICKED FACE as he listens to the footsteps.
Wheezing, with great difficulty, Nedry bends his knees and strains.  With
everything he's got, he lifts the incub
ator waist-height.  And holds it.
BACK ON MULDOON - Muldoon's footsteps ECHO as they come closer and closer
to the garage.  Muldoon whips down the curve in the stairs.  His jacket
catches on an incomplete section of banister. Yanks him to a stop.
CLOSE ON - Muldoon's jacket as it RIPS, stays caught.
BACK ON - NEDRY as he tries to heave higher, can't.  Beads a sweat roll
down his brow.
MULDOON FREES HIS caught jacket and then keep going.
Nedry's face drips with sweat.  The incubator slips out of his sweaty
palms.  Catches it with his knee.  Nedry curses and with one forceful
boost, he lifts the incubator shoulder height.
CLOSE ON - Muldoon's feet on long stairwell. BOOM. BOOM. BOOM.
NERVOUS, NEDRY BREATHES in a labored fashion.  He looks this way and
that.  He closes his eyes and with one superhuman effort, he heaves the
incubator into the back seat of the red jeep.  Nedry exhales.
At that moment, MULDOON ENTERS the vestibule between stairs and garage.
NEDRY EYES the shadowy figure in the vestibule.
Nedry's frightened face.
MULDOON STOPS and reaches in his belt.  He pulls out his pistol.  He
takes out long, shiny cartridges.  He loads the pistol.
NEDRY LEAPS in the front of the jeep, pushing aside the rocket launcher,
and zooms into the night.
A moment later, Muldoon enters the garage.  He sniffs at the exhaust
that still hangs in the air.  He looks over and is surprised to see his
jeep gone.  He bends and inspects fresh tread marks. He looks up, his
face straining to understand.
EXT  PARK ROAD - NIGHT
Nedry's red jeep flies down the park road.
CLOSE ON - Nedry's wheel as he turns it.
His tires skid sideways, then regain traction.  The jeep bolts up a
smaller access road.  He skids to a stop at the top of the hill.
Nedry jumps out and looks up.  His high beams illuminate a huge electric
fence prominently labeled:  DANGER!  10,000 Volts!
Two safety fences separate Nedry from the electric fence.  He races to
the first one, pulls out a key chain.  He tries one key, then another,
and another.  It f
its.  Nedry unlocks the gate, swings open the door.
Nedry runs to the second gate.  He slips in the mud.  He slides to the
ground, dropping keys in a muddy pool.
CLOSE ON - Nedry's hand frantically fishing for the key chain in the
muddy water.  Got them!   Unlocks the second gate.
He races to the electric fence.  RAIN PELTS him now.  Water beads on his
face.  Lightning flashes on the 10,000 volts warning.
He grabs the gate with his bare hand and swings it open.
Nedry heads back to his jeep, his fat body strobed by its high beams.
He jumps in the jeep and drives through.  Behind him, the open gates
move recklessly in the stormy night.
BACK ON GARAGE
Ellie and Harding pull in, in their own gas-powered jeep.  Muldoon is
waiting for them.  Now there's a rifle slung over his shoulder.  Harding

ferocious face of the Spitter, the sides of its bright poisonous gills
spinning to a stop.
The breathing gets closer and closer.  The children huddle together in a
corner of the gift shop.  They SCREAM.
It's A RAPTOR, lean and ferocious.  More like a cyborg than a hunter, it
studies the kids from just outside the gift shop entrance.  His eyes
flick back and forth between the two pieces of meat.

steel burners to the chopping blocks to the potwashing area.  The kids
dart and duck from one area to the next, taking shortcuts under tables,
crawling behind counters, scattering pots and pans behind.
Relentlessly, with a casual speed, the raptor stalks them.  It avoids
their obstacles with a casual grace and when it cannot fit through their

Automated drills whir as Tim and Lex crash through, knocking equipment

magnetic tape as the kids race by.

The kids slide int

incubators and display cases of chemicals.  They look back and see -

been in this room, their place of refuge, the whole time.
CLOSE ON - The raptor's glistening eyes register the children.
He begins to stalk.  The kids SCREAM.  This time there is nowhere to go.
The raptor closes in on the kids.  Timmy feebly stands in front of his
younger sister.
CLOSE ON - The raptor licks its lips, lizard-like.
At the other end of the room, GRANT ENTERS quickly.  He surveys the
situation.  Quickly, he grabs an egg off a table.  He reaches into one
of the chemical cabinets with POISON WARNINGS prominently displayed.  He
comes out with a syringe and a vial.
The raptor is almost on the kids.  Grant coughs conspicuously.  The
raptor whirls, studies Grant.  He looks back at the children.

up, swallowing it whole.
The raptor turns back to the kids.  He takes two steps toward them,
tenses to pounce - and keels over.  DEAD.

tools off the scaffolding as they go.  The raptor is just one beat
behind, and his snar
ling face is splashed with red paint as he chases.

rubs and hurl them back at the raptor.  The raptor is undeterred,
closing the gap on the kids.
