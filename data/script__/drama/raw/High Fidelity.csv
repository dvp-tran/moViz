Not a minisystem, not a matching set, but coveted audiophile
clutter of McIntosh and Nakamichi, each component from a
different era, bought piece by piece in various nanoseconds
of being flush."|stage direction
5|ROB (V.O.)|"What came first?  The music or the
misery?  People worry about kids
playing with guns and watching violent
videos, we're scared that some sort
of culture of violence is taking
them over..."|speech
6||"RECORDS
Big thin LPs.  Fields of them.  We move across them, slowly...
they seem to come to rest in an end of a few books... but
then the CD's start, and go on, faster and faster, forever
then the singles, then the tapes..."|stage direction
7|ROB (V.O.)|"But nobody worries about kids
listening to thousands -- literally
thousands -- of songs about broken
hearts and rejection and pain and
misery and loss."|speech
8||"It seems the records, tapes, and CD's will never end until...
we come to ROB -- always a hair out of place, a face that
grows on you.  He sits in an oversized beanbag chair and
addresses us, the wall of music behind him."|stage direction

was miserable, or was I miserable
because I listened to pop music?"|speech

11||"Group of bags huddled next to the door.  Not the go-on-
vacation set, but the clothes-to-coffee-maker moving out
variety.  Rob stares at them, his face unreadable, his head
gripped by a big pair Boudokan headphones.  We hear what he
is hearing, something foreboding and upbeat at the same time.
LAURA, Rob's girlfriend, enters the room, and he immediately
pulls the headphones off.  She clocks him for a moment,
catching him in what seems to be an old and repeated moment
of nonpresence.  She begins to heft the bags, Rob goes to
her, a little tardy for his big goodbye.  Laura begins to
cry a bit."|stage direction
12|LAURA|I don't really know what I'm doing.|speech

might as well, you know..."|speech
16|ROB|Well stay for tonight, then.|speech
17||"Laura shakes her head, lifts the last small bag, and backs
out the door.  A strap catches on a handle and the two of
them wrestle with it a bit, while trying to keep the door
open, until Laura awkwardly disappears from view and the
door shuts behind Rob.  He stays right there staring at the
shut door for a long moment, listening to the fading sound
of Laura and her dragging bags.

Rob's left hand cranks the volume knob while his right
switches the CD changer to something loud and adrenal.  He
addresses us again."|stage direction

Can you see your name in that list,
Laura?  Maybe you'd sneak into the
top ten, but there's no place for
you in the top five.  Sorry.  Those
places are reserved for the kind of
humiliations and heartbreaks that
you're just not capable of delivering."|speech
24||"He adjusts the angle of the TV, stuffs a creepy family
portrait into a drawer."|stage direction
25|ROB|"That probably sounds crueler than
it's meant to, but the fact is, we're
too old to take each other miserable.
Unhappiness used to mean something.
Now it's just a drag like a cold or
having no money."|speech

39|ROB (V.O.)|"It would be nice to think that since
I was fourteen, times have changed,
relationships have become more
sophisticated, females less cruel,
skins thicker, but there still seems
to be an element of that afternoon

me since.  All my other romantic

On the walls are bagged 45's you will never hear unless you
commit your life to the losing proposition of listening to
every noodling of Jah Wobble and Glen Glenn and other people
you've never heard of.
But as Rob opens the door, enters, and flips a switch causing
the fluorescents to sputter, we see in his eyes the reverence
and earnestness of a football coach gazing across an empty
field or a priest drawn at midnight to his empty church."|stage direction

next to the door, as if bracing for a street fight.
The SOUND gets closer, then stops.  The door swings open to
admit VINCE and JUSTIN, two fifteen-year-old skate punks.
Vince's hair is post-apocolyptically hacked to different
lengths, Justin's in uniformly shaven with leopard spots
dyed browse.  Rob follows them, watching their every move.
Dick counters from his perch, getting another angle.  Barry
cracks his knuckles threateningly.  Vince and Justin do their

Debacle is that you gotta punch your
weight.  Charlie was out of my Class:
too pretty, too smart, too witty,
too much.  What am I?  Average.  A
middleweight.  Not the smartest guy
in the world, but certainly not the
dumbest.  I've read books like The
Unbearable Lightness of Being,
Angela's Ashes, and Love in the Time
of Cholera, and understood them, I
think -- they're about girls, right? --
just kidding -- but I don't like
them very much.  My all time top
five favorite books are Johnny Cash's
autobiography, Snow Crash by Neil
Stevenson, Zen and the Art of
Motorcycle Maintenance, The Trouser
Press Guides to Rock, and, I don't
know, probably something by Kurt
Vonnegut.  I look through the New
Yorker when my neighbor's done with
it, and I'm not averse to going down
to the Fine Arts to watch subtitles
films, although on the whole I prefer
American films.  Top five being Blade
Runner, Cool Hand Luke, the first
two Godfathers which we'll count as
one, Taxi Driver, and The Shining.
I'm okay looking, average height,
not skinny, not fat.  My genius, if
I can call it that, is to combine a
whole load of averageness into one
compact frame.  You might say there
were millions like me, but there
aren't, really: Alot of guys have
impeccable music taste but don't
read, alot of guys read but are really
fat, alot of guys are sympathetic to
women but have stupid beards, alot
of guys have a Woody Allen sense of
humor but look like Woody Allen.
Some drink too much, some drive like
assholes, some get into fights, or
show off money, or do drugs.  I don't
do any of these things, really.  If
I do okay with women it's not because
of the virtues I have, but because
of the ugly flaws I don't have...

I do.  I will."|speech
1667|ROB|Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.|speech
1668|LAURA|"I mean, maybe you're right.  But
were you really expecting me to say
yes?"|speech
1669|ROB|"I dunno.  Didn't think about it,
really.  It was the asking that was
the important thing."|speech
1670|LAURA|Well, you've asked.|speech

1673||INT. ARTFUL DODGER - NIGHT|location
1674||"TWO TURNTABLES
with the mixer in the middle. ""Just Begun"" by Jimmy Castor
spins on turntable #1.  A hand reaches in, and begins to
draw the slides down, quieting the music.
Rob looks up from behind the deejay table, set up amongst
the instruments.  The place is packed with people, and
everyone seems to be having a great time.
Almost everyone -- Rob sees Barry, who pretends to nod off
when Rob catches his eye, and Justin, who looks back at him
and mocks a bulimic act.  Rob gives him the finger.  He sees
Laura, and she beams at him.  He comes to the front of the
stage, and taps a microphone."|stage direction
1675|ROB|"Uh, thanks for uh, coming out tonight.
I hope you have a good time.  And I
hope you like the record.  The one
by the Kinky Wizards.  The record
that we're having this record release
party for."|speech
1676||(hoots from the crowd)|location
1677|ROB|Thanks.  Listen to it first, though.|speech
1678||(laughs)|location
1679|ROB|"Okay.  We'll get to that later.
Right now, I'd like to introduce..."|speech

1681|ROB|Sonic Death Monkey.|speech
1682||"Good-natured applause.  Rob steps down and bee-lines to Laura.
Barry and his crew mount the stage.  Rob takes a big gulp of
beer."|stage direction

1684|ROB|"I'm an idiot.  I should have played
the record first.  This place is
about to get burned down."|speech
1685|LAURA|"It's gonna be fine.  These people
are ready for anything."|speech
1686||(dubious)|location
1687|BARRY|Yeah, well...|speech
1688||"Barry stands in front of the mic, surveying the crowd with a
smile.  He and the band all wear suits and ties."|stage direction
1689|BARRY|"Thanks for the enthusiastic intro,
Rob.  We're not called Sonic Death
Monkey anymore, though, ladies and
gentlemen.  We might be on the verge
of becoming the Atavistics, but we
haven't decided yet.  But tonight,
we are... BARRY JIVE AND THE UPTOWN
FIVE!  ONE TWO THREE --And they launch
into Marvin Gaye's ""Got To Give It
Up,"" almost flawlessly faithful to
the original.  Barry is transformed --
shuffling footwork, a wide smile,
and when the intro winds up, an almost
perfect falsetto.  The crowd goes
nuts, filling the floor.  Rob is
stunned, begins to smile.  Laura
takes his hand and leads him out
into the crowd..."|speech
