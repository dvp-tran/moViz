on TV. As CAMERA CIRCLES the room, we glimpse THE MOVIE;
an injured soldier calls for help amid shocking gunfire.
TRACKING BEHIND THE TV, we see Chris' wrought face and a
household bustling around him. COLTON carries party
plates outside, MCKENNA fights to get cowboy boots on and-
TAYA CALLS to him from the kitchen but we can't hear her
until the CAMERA TRACKS to HER POV-- the gunfire is gone,
the TV IS OFF. That war movie is playing in his head.
TAYA
Chris...?
He finally looks up, slick with sweat, affecting calm."|unknown

set up birthday decorations. The family dog, A PYRENEES
SHEEPDOG, bounds about. TAYA AND CHRIS, on back steps.
TAYA
--his game is Saturdays. He's the tallest
kid on the team. The doctor said he could
be six-four. I can't wait for you to see
him play. Maybe you could even coach?
Chris looks past his kids, looking a thousand yards out.
TAYA
McKenna's about to lose that tooth and
I'm worried she's going to swallow it.
She said she'd let you pull it. But only
you.
His head falls. When he looks up--
COLTON'S BIRTHDAY PARTY UNDERWAY
6 YEAR OLDS and PARENTS mill around but all WE HEAR--

TAYA (VO) (CONT'D)
I wish you'd talk to me, Chris.
COLTON AND TWO FRIENDS chase each other around the yard.
TAYA (VO) (CONT'D)
I just feel this dark space between us
and I don't know how to reach you.
THE SHEEPDOG jumps on the back of COLTON'S FRIEND. The
boy goes down hard, gets up crying, running from the dog.
The Sheepdog does it again. THE BOY FALLS AND HIS CRYING
is cuts into scene. THE BOY'S MOM runs over. His back
clawed up.
BOY'S MOM
Get him off! Get away--
Chris rips the dog off by its collar. The dog snaps at
him and in an instant he whips out his .45 to shoot it.
TAYA (OC)
No! He's a puppy. He doesn't know!
Chris looks up, bent with animus, and he's looking at the
face of his children, their friends, and their parents--
They look at him, terrified. He releases the dog. Lost."|unknown
