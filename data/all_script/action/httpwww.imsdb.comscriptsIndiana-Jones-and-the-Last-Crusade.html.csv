Riders on horseback cross the desert. From this distance they appear to be a
company of Army Cavalry Soldiers.

this is a TROOP OF BOY SCOUTS, all of them about thirteen years of age. The

FOUR MEN digging with shovels and pick-axes. They have broken into one of the
pueblo's SECRET CHAMBERS... called ""Kivas.""
The men are ROUGH RIDER (his name describes his dress), ROSCOE (a Bowery
Boy bully of 14) and HALFBREED (with straight black hair that cascades over his
shoulders).
And the fourth man wears a LEATHER WAIST JACKET and BROWN FELT
FEDORA HAT. He has his back turned to us, but we would be willing to bet
anything that this is INDLANA JONES.
However, when the man turns, and his face is illuminated by the lantern's glow,
we are shocked to discover that it is someone else.
We'll call him FEDORA."|stage direction

puts the Cross in his belt.
INDY PREPARES TO JUMP into the saddle. Hesitates. Then... he JUMPS. But
the horse moves exactly at the wrong moment and Indy lands flat on his feet in a
standing position. The impact sends a shock wave up his body that rattles his
back teeth. Indy stands up and successfully mounts his horse.
FEDORA AND HIS MEN ARRIVE at the roof's edge in time to see INDY climb into

more gang members). Now we glimpse...
THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT
The passenger in the car. His face is concealed by the hat's wide brim. His arm
is out the window, however, and we see an olive-colored hand protruding from

with his horse... they begin to squeeze in on it.
Speeding Autos. Thundering hooves. Rushing wind. Flying dust. INDY crouched

pumping.
INDY VEERS OFF in a new direction—toward a RAILROAD TRACK."|stage direction

109||"The train is barreling down the track. INDY rides up beside it. He glances over
his shoulder and sees the car and truck gaining on him. No other choice... he
LEAPS FROM HORSE TO TRAIN.
He clings to the side of a BOXCAR, as HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER leap from
the truck onto the train.
HALFBREED tries to grab INDY, but Indy leaps onto another boxcar. Halfbreed
runs after him but Indy leaps from the boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked
on a flatcar.

running after him, Indy enters the trap door of..."|stage direction

113||"Then, HALFBREED ENTERS through the trap door—followed by ROUGH RIDER.
Halfbreed grabs hold of INDY's feet, but Indy kicks at him and he loses his grasp.
INDY crawls away, toward an opening on the opposite side. HALFBREED grabs at
Indy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we SEE large bins of squirming snakes.
The combined weight of the three people is more than the catwalk was intended
for, and the BOLTS BEGIN TO RIP FROM THE CEILING.
Everyone holds their breath, afraid to make another move. Too late. SEVERAL
BOLTS TEAR FREE. HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER SCREAM... but it's Indy's
end of the catwalk that DROPS DOWN... PLUNGING INDY to the floor of the car.
He lands hard, with a SPLASH into a vat of water... where he finds himself eye-
to-eye with an—
ENORMOUS ANACONDA
The head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a Tyrannosaurus Rex."|stage direction

rolling from side to side, coming perilously close to rolling right off the edge.
Things get even more serious when Roscoe PULLS A KNIFE.
IN THE BOXCAR BELOW
... THE FEROCIOUS BLACK RHINO is becoming extremely agitated by the
commotion going on atop his cage. Finally, he raises his head and THRUSTS HIS
HORN THROUGH THE ROOF.
BACK TO THE ROOFTOP
as the horn SMASHES through the wood only inches from INDY's head. Indy and
Roscoe stare at the horn in amazement as they continue to struggle.
SMASH! The horn comes up again—RIGHT BETWEEN INDY'S LEGS."|stage direction

In an instant, he calculates his approach—times the distance—and LEAPS for
the tank's WATER SPOUT."|stage direction
136||CONTINUED:|unknown
137||"He catches it perfectly... but his velocity causes the water spout to ROTATE A

144||Ohhh!|unknown
145||"INDY's eyes take a moment to adjust to the dark. A bit of sunlight leaks in
through the cracks between the boards.
Then INDY sees it. At the far end of the boxcar. Rising slowly to its feet... an
AFRICAN LION. The Lion ROARS. The boxcar walls shake. Indy gasps. Dust
swirls up into the shafts of sunlight.
And INDY has one more surprise in store: The Cross of Cortes has been dislodged
from his belt during the fall...
INDY glances around, sees a coiled LION TAMER'S WHIP hanging on a nail. He
carefully takes it down by the handle. The Lion sees this and GROWLS SOFTLY.
INDY swallows hard and gives the whip a try. It unravels awkwardly, its TIP
flying back and HITTING INDY IN THE FACE... CUTTING his chin.
The Lion GROWLS LOUDER. Indy quickly gathers up the whip, wets his lips, and
tries again. This time—success! The WHIP CRACKS SHARPLY. The Lion
BELLOWS and SWATS the air... and steps back.
INDY looks amazed and delighted. He CRACKS the whip again. The Lion backs
away even more. Indy inches forward—bends down (never taking his eyes off
the Lion)—picks up the Cross—and steps back again, sweat pouring down his
face.
But now... how to get out?
He looks up at the opening through which he fell and sees FEDORA LOOKING
DOWN AT HIM. Fedora extends his hand."|stage direction

It's NIGHT. RAIN POURS down. We're in the middle of a violent STORM AT SEA.
Thirty-foot waves crash across the deck.
The TWO PORTUGUESE SAILORS (who have Indy's arms pinned behind his back)
propel INDY across the deck toward the rail.
As they pass a BUNDLE OF FUEL DRUMS, INDY uses the Two Sailors as leverage
to KICK UP HIS FEET and break open the CLAMP on the metal bands that hold
the drums together.
INDY jabs his elbows into the stomachs of the startled Sailors and rushes toward
the MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT.
PANAMA HAT sees INDY coming and hurries toward the ladder that leads up to
the bridge. Indy withstands the force of waves crashing on the deck and makes
his way to where Panama Hat is climbing the ladder. He pulls him off the ladder
from behind the two men fall down on the deck. Indy takes the cross back from

sailors who attack him from the sides.
INDY sees that the Cross is about to be swept overboard. He lunges for it.
He SNATCHES UP the Cross only to be knocked down to the deck by a giant wave.

avoiding a huge wave behind him. He jumps into the rollicking ocean, still
holding onto the cross. On the ship, a giant fuel drum rolls wildly, falling directly
onto a crate of TNT. The crate explodes, causing the entire ship to blow, sending
an enormous orange fireball into the sky.

turns his horse completely around, 180 degrees. The tank starts to follow.
POV THROUGH THE VIEWING PORT
VOGEL watches the ground turning 180 degrees as he tries to catch up with
INDY.
Cleverly, INDY has turned the tank directly into a head-on
collision course with some of the pursuit vehicles and a Kubelwagon.
The tank and the Kubelwagon smash into each other, the German military sedan
becoming lodged between the treads while blocking the front view and any use of
the six-pound cannon on the turret.
INDY, meanwhile, leans down on his horse, scooping up a stone from the wall of
a culvert. He reigns his horse, paralleling the tank, as everyone scurries about
inside, looking through viewing ports, trying to figure out exactly where Indy is."|stage direction

alignment shift that betrays the trick. Indy throws some dirt on the bridge and
he crosses it like the first Crusader from the painting over Henry's desk.
Indy crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff and enters a Temple.
A vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this small Temple. Perhaps a
hundred or more. Many sizes, many shapes, some gold, some silver, but they all
glitter and shine.
INDY is mesmerized by their number and their beauty. And then he realizes that
a man is praying at the altarl
He has his back turned to INDY... but he is dressed as what he is! A GRAIL
KNIGHT.
CLOSE ON THE GRAIL KNIGHT
But we can't see the Grail Knight's face. The visor of his helmet is down.
Perhaps we see his eyes."|stage direction

2069||"When the GRAIL KNIGHT sees INDY he gets wearily to his feet and, surprisingly,
prepares to give combat...taking up his two-handed broadsword...he comes at
Indy, attempting to swing the huge, heavy sword but finding the effort almost too
much. Indy dodges two or three clumsy swings of the sword, making no attempt
to fight back...until the Knight, exhausted, drops the sword and collapses. Indy
approaches him and raises the visor and we see that the Knight is a very ancient
man."|stage direction

INDY and ELSA come forward with the Grail.

down their guns and kneel.
INDY kneels by HENRY's side and tilts his head forward and holds the Grail to
his lips.
HENRY is too weak to even open his eyes.
HENRY swallows some of the water. Much of it runs down the corners of his
mouth. Finally INDY pours the water over the wound and everyone watches in
astonishment as the wound and the blood stain disappear before their eyes. The
color returns to Henry's face.
HENRY's eyes open. The first thing he sees is the Grail and they light up. Then
they shift to INDY's face—and they light up even more...
