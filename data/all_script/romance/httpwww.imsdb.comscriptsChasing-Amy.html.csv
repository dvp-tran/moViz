descendant of the black tribe that
established the first society on the
planet, while all you European mother
fuckers were still hiding in caves and
shit, all terrified of the sun. He's a
strong role model that a young black
reader can look up to, Cause I'm here
to tell you - the chickens are comin'
home to roost, ya'll: the black man's
no longer gonna play the minstrel in

father.  And in Jedi, they become

of whom!  At the end of the song, the crowd goes wild but
Alyssa's preoccupied.  She points to someone in the
crowd, and curls her finger back in a 'c'mere' fashion,
urging whoever it is to join her.  She jumps off the

shucks style.  At that moment, the Girl beside him leaps
forward.  Banky's eyes widen.  Holden looks up and is

conscious about that smell factor, and
so most of the time they just lay
there, frozen like a deer in the
headlights, right?  Not for nothing,

let her know where to go, and what the
status is.  You gotta handle it like
CNN and the Weather Channel - constant
updates."|speech

all changed.  I loosened up.  Not only

she's had sex, but not the standard

something to do with your lifestyle

853||"HANGING OUT MONTAGE BEGINS
With the requisite music, over which we hear a
conversation between Holden and Alyssa.
1) Holden and Alyssa sit in the DINER eating.  Holden's
talking.  The Waitress walks past and drops her pad.  She
bends over, to pick it up, hiking her mini-skirt up in
the process.  Alyssa stares at her ass.  Holden stops
talking and stares at her.  Alyssa looks over at him and
offers a caught smile.
2) Holden pushes a shopping cart at the FOOD STORE,
throwing various things into the basket.  Alyssa comes up
with a box of Tampons and throws them in.  Holden glances
at them, a bit flushed.  Alyssa catches him, picks up the
box, and pulls one out.  She proceeds to demonstrate
their usage, throwing one leg on the can and miming
insertion.  Holden puts up his hands in the ""I know, I
know,"" fashion.
3) In the Studio, Holden displays some of his artwork to
Alyssa, during which she pulls out a cigarette and goes
to light it.  It's a child-proof lighter, so she's having
trouble.  Holden grows a little frustrated.  Finally, he
grabs the lighter and pulls the child proof tab out with
his teeth.  Alyssa stares at him a bit taken aback.
Holden spits the tab out, and lights Alyssa's smoke.  He
then continues with his display.
4) Holden and Alyssa at the COMIC BOOK STORE.  Steve-Dave
and the Fan-Boy eye them suspiciously.  Alyssa pays for a
comic.  Steve-Dave glowers at Holden.  He gives Alyssa
her change and they exit.  Steve-Dave goes back to his
card game with the Fan-Boy.  Suddenly, a garbage can
comes crashing through their window.  Steve-Dave rips a
check off the garbage can and punches the counter.  The
Fan-Boy rubs his back soothingly,
5) Holden and Alyssa walk through a PARKING LOT, talking.
She takes his hand and pulls his arm around her shoulder.
Holden smiles to himself."|stage direction

it were the scarlet fucking letter."|speech

proportion.  We live in a more
tolerant age now.  You refer to
yourself as a dyke.  Hooper calls
himself a faggot all the time..."|speech

empowerment/disempowerment.  I call
myself a dyke so it's not too
devastating when some throwback
screams it at me as I'm leaving a bar
at night.
Same for Hooper - by calling himself a
faggot, he steals the thunder away
from the mouthy jerks of this world
who'd like to beat him to it.  But the
difference between us having it and
your friend saying it is miles wide.
We say it to mask the pain - you say
it for lack of a better expression at
any given moment.  No Holden, we do
not live in a more tolerant age.  And

You're the epitome of every attribute
and quality I've ever looked for in
another person.  I know you think of
me as just a friend and crossing that
line is the furthest thing from an
option you'd ever consider.  But I
can't do this any longer.  I can't
stand next to you without wanting to
hold you.  I can't look into your eyes
without feeling that longing you only
read about in trashy romance novels.
I can't talk to you without wanting to
express my love for everything you
are.  I know this will probably queer
our friendship - no pun intended - but
I had to say it, because I've never
felt this before, and I like who I am
because of it.  And if bringing it to
light means we can't hang out anymore,
then that hurts me.  But I couldn't
allow another 	day to go by without
getting it out there, regardless of
the outcome, which by the look on your
face is to be the inevitable shoot-
down.  And I'll accept that But I know
some part of you is hesitating for a
moment, and if there is a moment of
hesitation, that means you feel
something too.  All I ask is that you
not suppress that - at least for ten
minutes - and try to dwell in it
before you dismiss it.
There isn't another soul on this
fucking planet who's ever made me the
person I am when I'm with you, and I
would risk this friendship for the
chance to take it to the next plateau.
Because it's there between you and me.
You can't deny that.  And even if we
never speak again after tonight,
please know that I'm forever changed
because of you and what you've meant
to me, which - while I do appreciate
it - I'd never need a painting of
birds bought at a diner to remind me
of."|speech

Banky carries a bag in one arm and pulls out his keys
with the other.  He jams them into the lock, opening the

INT STUDIO - DAY
He closes the door behind him and shuffles to the
kitchenette, passing by the blanket-covered, slumbering
forms of Holden and Alyssa, who are out cold in each
other's arms.  The place looks a mess - Like a couple of
people were engaged in some tremendous fucking.  Banky is
oblivious.  He sets the bag down on the counter and pulls
out a chocolate milk.  He opens it, sticks a straw into
the top, and begins sipping and sifting through the mail.
He comes to mail that's Holden's and tosses it onto the
couch, near Holden's head.  He looks down at the sleeping
couple, then back at the mail for a couple of beats.
Then he freezes.  He looks down again, and drops his jaw
and his carton of choco.  It hits the floor with a pop.
Holden and Alyssa shoot straight up, eyes struggling to
focus.  They look at one another, then at the
flabbergasted Banky.  Banky blinks.  Then he shuffles

lot of time to think about all of
this.  And what I've come up with is
really simple: I came to this on my
terms.  I didn't just heed what I was
taught, you  know?  Men and women
should be together, it's the natural
way - that kind of thing.  I'm not
with you because of what family,
society, life tried to instill in me
from day one.  The way the world is -
how seldom you meet that one person
who gets you... it's so rare.   My
parents didn't really have it.  There
was no example set for me in the world
of male/female relation ships.  And to
cut oneself off from finding that
person - to immediately half your
options by eliminating the possibility
of finding that one person within your
own gender... that just seemed stupid.
So I didn't.  And by leaving my
options open, I was branded 'gay',
which to me was no big deal - labels
are labels, you know?  They define
what you do, not who you are, I guess.
But 		then you come along.  You -
the one least likely; I mean, you were
a guy."|speech

a ceiling on that, because you were a
guy.
Until I remembered why I opened the
door to women in the first place - to
not limit the likelihood of finding
that one person who'd compliment me so
completely.  And so here we are, I was
thorough when I looked for you, and I
feel justified lying in your arms -
because I got here on my terms, and
have no question that there was
someplace I didn't look.  And that
makes all the difference."|speech

THE BIG OL' FALLING-IN-LOVE MONTAGE BEGINS
1) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves in various
directions, shaking her head accordingly.  Then she puts
up her hands to stop.  Cut to Holden, hanging the
picture.  Alyssa gave him.
It hangs at a severely crooked angle.  He looks back to
her and shakes his head 'no'.
2) Holden and Alyssa try to play a video game.  Banky
plays as well.  Holden instructs her in the ways of NHL
'96 (turning her paddle right-side-up, pointing at things
on the screen).  She presses the reset button, over and
over.  Banky gives Holden a 'What the fuck?' look.
Alyssa sticks her tongue at him.
3) At the Video Store - Holden picks up a Disney cartoon
off the shelf.  He goes to show if to Alyssa, who's
reading the back of 'Anything But Dick', an allchick
porno.  An old WOMAN stares at her.  Holden nods to the
old Woman and takes the tape out of Alyssa's hands,
putting it back on the shelf.  He ushers her away.  The
old Woman waits until they're gone and then picks up the
tape herself,
4) Holden carries Alyssa on his shoulders through the
park, her crotch against the back of his neck.  He's
talking. She taps him and he stops and looks up.  She
begins to maneuver around so her crotch is in his face.
He pulls her off and put her down.  She's laughing.  He's
flushed with embarrassment.  The same Old Woman from the
Video store passes by with her husband.  Holden shrugs.
5) In Holden's Apartment again - Alyssa again with the
waving, then putting up her hands to stop.  Cut to Holden
again, this time with the painting hung completely upside
down.  He looks at it, then offers her a bewildered gaze.
6) In the Office Banky comes to his drawing table.  There
are penciled pages on it with a note that says ""Hanging
out with Alyssa today.  Holden"".  Banky crumples it up
and throws it across the room.
7) In Holden's Apartment - Alyssa waves this way, then
that way, then puts up her hands frantically to stop.
She settles back against the wall, a satisfied smile
crawling across her face, and closes her eyes.  We pull
back to reveal Holden on his knees in front of her,
eating her out (no, we don't see anything!).

Men need to believe that they're Marco
fucking Polo when it comes to sex -

explored new territory.  And it's hard
not to let them believe it.  I let my
boys run with it for awhile - feed
them some of that ""I've never done
this before..."" bullshit, and let 'em
labor under the delusion that they
rockin' my world, until I can't stand
them anymore.  Then I hit 'em with the

done long before you got there."|speech

me that it was that time, in that

wrong, so she's not gonna apologize.
So I tell her it's over, and I walk."|speech

1514|BOB|"No, idiot.  It was a mistake.  I
wasn't disgusted with her, I was
afraid.  At that moment, I felt small -
like I'd lacked experience, like I'd
never be on her level or never be
enough for her or something.
And what I didn't get was that she
didn't care.  She wasn't looking for
that guy anymore.  She was looking for
me.  But by the time I realized this,
it was too late, you know.  She'd
moved on, and all I had to show for it
was some foolish pride, which then
gave way to regret.  She was the girl,
I know that now.  But I pushed her
away..."|speech

MONTAGE - AN UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE
1) Holden sits at his drawing table, tapping his pencil
up and down.
2)Alyssa sits in a club, getting talked at by some women.
She's not present in the conversation.
3) Banky meets with Sloss at a restaurant Sloss shakes
the contracts at him, and Banky makes the ""I know, I
know,"" face.
4) Holden stares at the picture Alyssa gave him.
5) Alyssa with her ear to the phone.  She hangs up,
angrily.
6) Holden sits in the park that he and Alyssa walked
through.  He's staring at Alyssa's yearbook picture.  He
closes the book and sighs.  Then, an idea hits him.  He
jumps up and dashes out of the park.
INT STUDIO - NIGHT
Banky and Alyssa sit on the couch.  Holden paces in front
of them."|stage direction
1542|HOLDEN|"I know you're wondering why I asked
you both here tonight, at the same
time, knowing that we have shit to
settle between us, separately."|speech
1543|BANKY|"I just figured you wanted to kill two
birds with one stone by telling her to
fuck off with me here so you didn't
have to go through the story again
later on."|speech
1544|ALYSSA|Fuck you.|speech
1545|BANKY|Not even if you let me videotape it.|speech
1546|HOLDEN|Enough!|speech
1547||(they both look at him)|location
1548|HOLDEN|"I've been going through things, over
and over.  And I dissected it all, and
looked at it a thousand different
ways.  Banky - there's friction
between us for the first time in our
lives.  You hate me dating Alyssa and
you want me to sign off on this M-TV
thing."|speech
1549|BANKY|How perceptive.|speech
1550|HOLDEN|"Alyssa - you and I hit a wall, because
I don't know how to deal with... your
past, I guess."|speech
1551|BANKY|"That's a nice way of putting it.  I'd
have said the whole double-stuff
thing..."|speech
1552||(right in his face)|location
1553|HOLDEN|"I'm only going to say it once: shut
up."|speech
1554||(back to pacing)|location
1555|HOLDEN|"Now - I know I'm to blame one way or
the other on both accounts.  With you,
Alyssa - it's my fault because I feel
inadequate.  Because you've had so
much experience, had such a big life;
and my life's been pretty small in
comparison."|speech
1556|ALYSSA|That doesn't matter to me...|speech
1557|HOLDEN|Please.  I have to get through this.|speech
1558||(beat)|location
1559|HOLDEN|"And with you Banky - I know why you're
having such a hard time with Alyssa,
and it's something that's been obvious
forever, but I guess I just didn't
acknowledge it."|speech

1563|BANKY|What?|speech
1564|HOLDEN|"You're attracted to me.  Just as, in a
way, I'm attracted to you.  I mean, it
makes sense - we've been together so
long, we have so much in common..."|speech
1565||(getting up)|location
1566|BANKY|"Well, I've got to get home and catch
the last few minutes of 'Babylon 5',
so I'll be..."|speech
1567||"Holden grabs him, kisses him full on the lips, and pushes
him back onto the couch Alyssa reacts.  Banky - wide-eyed
and speechless - looks away."|stage direction
1568|HOLDEN|"It's something you're going to have to
deal with.  Bank.  You may very well
be gay, which explains your homophobia
and why you're so jealous of Alyssa,
and your sense of humor as well."|speech
1569|BANKY|"Just 'cause a guy's got a predilection
coward dick jokes..."|speech
1570|HOLDEN|"Bank.  Stop.  Deal with it.  You'll
feel much better."|speech

yourself the question that I've been
going over and over in my head for the
last few days: what does one have to
do with the other?"|speech
1573||Alyssa's face drops.  She subtly shakes her head.|stage direction
1574||(under her breath)|location
1575|ALYSSA|Don't.|speech
1576|HOLDEN|"And when I did some serious soul-
searching, it came at me from out of
nowhere, and suddenly it all made
sense - a calm came over me.  I know
what we have to do.  And then you -
Bank, you Alyssa, and I - all of us...
can finally be... alright."|speech

eyes nearly bug.   Alyssa's  head drops."|stage direction
1582|HOLDEN|"Don't you see?  That would take care
of everything.  Alyssa - I wouldn't
feel inadequate or too conservative
anymore.  I'll have done something on
par with all the experience you've
had.  And it'll be with you, which'll
make it that much more powerful.  And
Banky - you can cake that leap that
everyone else but you sees that you
should take.  And it'll be okay,
because it'll be with me - your best
friend for years.  We've been
everything to each other but
intimates.  And now, we'll have been
through that together too.  And it
won't have to be a total leap for you,
because a woman will be involved.  And
when it's over, all that aggression
you feel toward Alyssa will be gone.
Because you'll have shared in
something beautiful with the woman I
love.  It'll be cathartic.  A true
communion.  We have to do this.  For
me, for both of you... for all of our
sakes.  This will keep us together."|speech
1583||(beat)|location
1584|HOLDEN|What do you say?|speech

couch and lets out a huge sigh.  Then shrugs."|stage direction

this."|speech
1593|ALYSSA|You did?  What does that say about me?|speech
1594|HOLDEN|"But you've... you've done... stuff...
like this.  This should be no big deal
for you."|speech
1595|ALYSSA|You don't want this.|speech
1596||(lights her cigarette)|location
1597|ALYSSA|You really don't want this.  Trust me.|speech
1598|HOLDEN|"I need this.  This has to happen.  Why
can't you see that?  And how can you
not?  What does that say about me?
You can take it from two guys whose
names you can barely remember, but I
ask you to share an experience like it
- where it's about intimacy - and you
say no?"|speech
1599||"(inhales from her cigarette,
takes a beat)"|location
1600|ALYSSA|I can't.|speech
1601||Holden moves to her side of the couch.|stage direction
1602|HOLDEN|"You can.  I'll be there.  And when
it's over, we'll be the strongest
we've ever been because we got through
some nasty shit together.  And we'll
finally be on the same level together.
And then there'll be nothing we can't
accomplish."|speech

touches his face."|stage direction

1606|ALYSSA|"That time is over for me.  I've been
there.  I've done it.  And I didn't
find what I was looking for in any of
it.  I found that in you - in us.
Doing this won't help you forget about
the things you're hung up on.  It'll
create more."|speech
1607|HOLDEN|"No it won't.  I thought about all of
that."|speech
1608|ALYSSA|"No, it will.  Maybe you'll see me
differently from then on - maybe
you'll despise me for going along with
it, once you're in the moment.  Maybe
I'll moan differently and then you'll
resent Banky, and become suspicious of
us.  Or you'll alienate him because of
it, and then grow to blame and hate me
for the deterioration of your
friendship.  Or what if- I sincerely
doubt it, but what if - I saw
something in Banky that I never saw
before, and fell in love with him and
left you.  I've been down roads like
this before; many times.  I know you
feel doing this will broaden your
horizons and give you experience.  But
I've had those experiences on my own.
I can't accompany you on your's.  I'm
past that now."|speech
1609||"(touches his face; stares to
cry)"|location

you'd want to share me with anyone.
