monitoring his worst nightmares. Suddenly- the Tesseract
THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility. Big enough where both
Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and they're at different ends
of the facility.
The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and
louder, like a boiling pot of water. The Tesseract's energy
builds up into a BEAM much like the Bifrost Bridge, which HITS
at the end of a platform that is wired to the CMS device. The
great maelstrom beam FIRES the TESSERACT energy. The beam then
forms a VORTEX, which then opens up a PORTAL.
A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED. From the portal, the blackness of
SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars
appears and a GUST of BLUE ENERGY CLOUDS fill the room, blinding
everyone.
The Tesseract's energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the
top the facility's vacuum chamber ceiling. It's abnormally
quiet. Then... HEAVY BREATHING is heard from the platform.
SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach, weapons in hands. A figure is
kneeling on the platform, smoke coming off it. It's LOKI.
Smiling in his mischievous manner, he raises his head. The smile
dies down. He looks deep into the eyes of Fury, Barton and
Selvig. He stands up, holing the scepter."|stage direction

and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT
TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss
Loki's fired shot.
ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the
bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the
platform and ATTACKS those firing at him.
In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his
KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to
see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost
gone to shit.
Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton
raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand."|stage direction
68|LOKI|You have heart.|speech
69||"Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head. Barton's
eyes suddenly glow BLACK. The ability to control Barton's mind
is now in Loki's hand. Barton puts his piece away and stands
straight.
As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of
several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract,
placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab.Then..."|stage direction

Thor SLIDES and DUCKS under the tail. Jumping up, he throws
Mjölnir with all his strength, knocking the HULK head over
