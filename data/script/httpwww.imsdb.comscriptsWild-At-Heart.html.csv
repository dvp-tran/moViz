With a whine from hell, the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed
bump.
The motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half
as it scrapes along the full length of a Datsun Kingcab.
In the air, the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by.
The motorcycle bounces off a black ’66 Chevrolet and makes a sound like
the end of the world.
The rider hits the same Chevy a moment later.  Like a broken ragdoll
shot from a canon, the man punches through the back window blowing glass
for a block.  He stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of
blood forms out his nose.
The motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing
howl for one entire city block."|stage direction

The first thing you’ll want to know is I’m keeping the baby.
Mama wasn’t for it in the beginning but I think she’s looking
forward to it.  I’m gonna name it Pace no matter if it’s a
boy or a girl.  Pace Ripley sounds good, don’t it?  It’s
kind of hard to believe that Pace will be six years old
when you get out.
I feel like I’m kind of in prison too, but I know in six
months, it’ll be over and I’ll have a son or daughter to
show for it.  Our child!!
I love you Sailor.  I don’t know how much or what it
means though I miss you an awful bunch sometimes I know
you’re thinking about me cause I can feel it.  I miss
you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever
called me that.
Mama married Santos.  It just about drove me crazy.  My
daddy left a lot of money somehow and they’re spending
it like there is no tomorrow.  I’m going to move out as
soon as I can.
Mama and Santos said because of the baby they’re lookin’
at the two of us in a different light - whatever that
means.
Johnnie Farragut has plumb disappeared.  No one knows
where.  I miss him, but not near as much as I miss you.

What about a middle name if it is a boy after my

he is long passed.  Pace Roscoe Ripley does not sound
so bad do you think?
This place is not so pretty as Pee Dee.  Not pretty
at all.  There are boys inside these walls meaner
than Peru you can bet.  There is a Death House.  I
am getting along.  The only thing is not thinking
about the future.
I miss dancing with you, too.  I love you.  It is
