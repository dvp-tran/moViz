down the bleak boulevard. In it: JOE STEVENS, an angry, black
man in his late 20's, beside him his 10-year-old son, JOE
JR.
Joe Jr. stares out the window at passing: boarded buildings,
whores with raincoats over their heads trying to flag down a
john, a black Santa, a knot of drinkers. Breaking the silence:"|stage direction

just before entering the store, draws a handgun from beneath
his coat.
The boy gazes dreamily at the street. The lunatic Black Santa
marches by, ranting to himself (""Then the white man say..."").
The RAIN HAMMERS on the roof and windshield. Joe Jr. breathes
on the glass, fogging the scene.
From the store: MUFFLED GUNFIRE.
Joe Jr. looks that way. Another GUNSHOT, then:
His father comes out the door clutching money in one hand.
He strides toward the car with a reckless pride. He doesn't
notice:
The liquor store door opens behind him.
A SHOTGUN BLAST. Joe Stevens' guts splatter onto the car
windshield. A look of terrible amazement; he sinks to his
knees."|stage direction

who is too frightened to move."|stage direction
32|JOE JR.|Please, Mister...|speech
33||"The man dies on his feet. As he falls backward, he pulls the
trigger, the BLAST shattering the car windows.
Cop cars SQUEAL up. Uniformed cops leap out, guns drawn,
survey the scene. Then one notices Joe Jr., staring motionless

father killed when you were ten, and
you decided you wouldn't be like
that."|speech

Carver grins)"|location
111|CARVER|"I'm God, I know everything. You wanted
to be a good boy, so you became a
