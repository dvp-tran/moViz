9||"INT   CONFERENCE ROOM   TIMELESS
Overhead lamps cast pools of LIGHT down onto A CONFERENCE
TABLE, onto THE HANDS of PEOPLE assembled to observe the
video. We see NO FACES. But expensive WATCHES, sleeves
with high-ranking STRIPES, indicate wealth, power, and a
military presence.
THE VIDEO: On the wall behind MARCUS, we see SHADOWS darting
frantically. We hear VOICES rising in panic."|stage direction

the foreground. We only see it for a few video frames, but

EXT  FOREST LAND   PRE-DAWN
A DARK SKY ...and in the foreground, profiled against a FULL
MOON, A DARK FACE ...watching the heavens with piercing black
eyes, alert, though not predatory. This is CHRIS REDFIELD,
young, handsome. More than simply an outdoor type, he seems
perfectly in place, almost part of the environment.
A band of purple tints the horizon, outlining the tops of
magnificent uncorrupted hills that extend for miles. Sitting
on a ridge, squinting into that band of light, Chris sees ...
...AN EAGLE coasting on a channel of wind that cuts through
the hilltops. As the bird moves swiftly closer, it becomes
recognizable. Chris smiles and jots a note on a pad.
The regal bird lands on a high rock where ...unexpectedly...
a freshwater trout lies flapping, three-thousand feet above
the highest water."|stage direction
16|CHRIS|Take it, Goliath. It's yours.|speech
17||"""Goliath"" snaps up the fish and flies away with it."|stage direction
18|CHRIS (cont.)|See ya next year, guy.|speech
19||"Chris reaches into a water-filled bucket, pulls out another
trout, climbs efficiently, unerringly, across a precarious
Cliffside, and deposits the fresh fish on the-same high rock.
ANOTHER EAGLE, smaller, a female, appears in the sky."|stage direction
20|CHRIS (cont.)|Cleopatra.|speech
21||"Chris scrambles back to his place and jots another note.
""Cleopatra"" spots the fish, pumps her wings, and swoops down.
She's about to snap up the prize, but at the last minute, she
recoils and climbs again, hovering."|stage direction
22|CHRIS (cont.)|Come on. Come on down.|speech
23||"The eagle circles, its sharp eyes scanning. It makes another
dive, but stops short again."|stage direction
24|CHRIS (cont.)|What's the matter, beautiful?|speech
25||"The bird seems frightened.  Of what? It makes one more dive.
Gets very close to the fish... but suddenly SHRIEKS and peels,
away from the rock. Chris sees its eyes, looking crazed, as
it soars right past him, its wings brushing his hair.
Pg-3
CLOSE ON: CHRIS, concerned, as he watches the eagle disappear
over the hills.
Over his shoulder, we can see the high rock that holds the
fish. It's out of focus in the background, but the moonlight
catches SOMETHING MOVING there. Something that lets out a
sharp INHUMAN SOUND.
Chris whirls around. There's nothing on the rock. Nothing
at all. The fish has been taken.
INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   DAWN
CHRIS walks into a characterless apartment. He quietly
sheds his clothes. Even in silhouette, we can see that his
body is in perfect shape, not pumped, but lean and tight.
Moving lithely, with the natural grace of a cat, he eases
himself into a bed where...
...a beautiful young girl, JILL VALENTINE, seems to be fast
asleep. As Chris nestles in beside her, we see that her
eyes, facing away, are open. Chris gently drapes an arm
around her and lets his body relax."|stage direction
26|CHRIS|"(A whisper) Glad you're still
here, lady"|speech
27|JILL|It's my apartment.|speech
28|CHRIS|(Surprised) You're awake.|speech
29|JILL|I've been awake. Since you left.|speech
30|CHRIS|Sorry.|speech
31||"His apology goes no further. He's still troubled by what
happened in the hills."|stage direction
32|CHRIS (cont.)|There was... something wrong.|speech
33|JILL|"What, with my dinner? I never had
a mother. I'll learn."|speech
34||Chris smiles politely. He offers...|stage direction
35|CHRIS|I'll do the cooking.|speech
36||"Pg-4
...but he can't switch focus."|stage direction
37|CHRIS (cont.)|"On the mountain...there...must
have been something... prowling
around up there."|speech
38|JILL|"There are probably all kinds of
things prowling around up there.
In the middle of the night."|speech
39||Chris apologizes again, this time more sincerely.|stage direction
40|CHRIS|"I'm sorry. Really. You...have to
be there at dawn. They ride the
wind over the ridge."|speech
41|JILL|Dawn? You left at one A.M.|speech
42|CHRIS|"I had to go fishing. It's the fish
that bring them down, so I can get
a close look at them. (Enthused)
I've tracked a dozen of them, Jill.
Twelve of those big bruisers. I can
actually recognize them. I've even
given them names, over the years."|speech
43|JILL|You've been doing this for years?|speech
44|CHRIS|"Only in the early Autumn. When
they're' migrating."|speech
45|JILL|I'II set the alarm for next. October.|speech
46||Jill rolls over and faces him.|stage direction
47|JILL (cont.)|"I wish I could get excited. Really.
That's the truth. As excited as you,
over such... simple things."|speech
48|CHRIS|"Beauty... isn't simple. If it was...
I'd be beautiful."|speech
49|JILL|You are.|speech
50||Pg-5|stage direction
51|CHRIS|"No, no, no.  I'm simple.  You, on the
other hand...(nuzzling closer)...have
all that... stuff... hiding underneath
somewhere. That's what fascinates me."|speech
52|JILL|Fascination. Not love?|speech
53||"Jill is being playful. Chris, taking her question to heart,
becomes introspective."|stage direction
54|CHRIS|"I... honestly don't know. I guess
I've been... living alone too long.
You're the first, the only woman I've
ever thought of as... a real partner."|speech
55||Now Jill becomes introspective.|stage direction
56|JILL|"I've always been...afraid of living
alone. I've always had... people...
talking at me... knowing they could
wind me up and I'd do... (shrug) ...
whatever they wanted."|speech
57||Chris looks into her eyes. She kisses him gently.|stage direction
58|JILL (cont.)|"We all have... something hidden...
underneath.  Beauty may not be simple.
But it's not all that complicated,
Either.  Most of the time, you find
It... right in the middle of all the...
confusion."|speech
59|CHRIS|"I'm part Mohawk. Indians are never
confused. At least, they never let
it show."|speech
60||"They kiss again, this time more passionately. Rolling over,
they begin to make love.
EXT   FARM   DAWN
The purple horizon is turning orange, but it's still quite
dark when a crusty old farm-hand, RAKE, opens the creaking
door of a stable and, with a flashlight, leads THREE HORSES
out into the morning breeze.
Two dogs, A LAB and A SPANIEL, romp at his heels as Rake
opens a log gate.
Pg-6
Two of the untethered horses trot obediently into a large
corral. The third, a beautiful stallion, resists, snorting,
tossing its head in high spirit."|stage direction
61|RAKE|"Get in there, Lucky. Quit horsin'
around. Get in."|speech
62||"""LUCKY"" moves into the corral, strutting proudly."|stage direction
63|RAKE (cont.)|"Swear. If I didn't know you was
just an animal, I'd say you was all
full of yourself. GET IN THERE!"|speech
64||"Rake waves his flashlight, not meanly, there is clearly a
great deal of affection here. Rake shuts the gate behind
the stallion, who begins to gallop around happily inside
the fence. All seems lovely, until...
...the dogs suddenly go on point. Their ears perk. They
sniff the air...and begin to WHINE."|stage direction
65|RAKE (cont.)|What's wrong with you two?|speech
66||"KER-RAAKK! A startling SOUND. Rake turns to find Lucky and
the other horses, their eyes flaring, trying to KICK their
way out of the fencing. They seem terrified.
CUT TO :
A WIDE SHOT:  of RAKE, and the frightened ANIMALS, from
two hundred yards away. THE CAMERA MOVES IN, slowly at
first, then gaining speed... extraordinary SPEED. We are
seeing THROUGH THE EYES OF... whatever it is that's running,
charging, SLATHERING HUNGRILY...
...reaching the corral, DARTING through the fence, past the
KICKING HORSES, and LEAPING at Rake, who whirls around...and
CRIES OUT in pain as his flashlight BLINDS us with WHITENESS.
EXT   AIR BASE   DAWN
The WHITENESS becomes the GLARE of HALOGEN LIGHTS. We are
overwhelmed by the SOUND of AIRCRAFT ENGINES. We see MEN,
armed SOLDIERS, scrambling into combat HELICOPTERS.
A RADIO MAN runs right toward THE CAMERA, holding out an
open receiver."|stage direction
67|RADIO MAN|Top brass, sir!|speech
68||"Pg-7
ANOTHER MAN, in the foreground, takes the radio-phone. We
can't see his face. Only his forearm, which bears A TATTOO
of a grinning SKULL."|stage direction
69|MAN WITH TATTOO|Alpha Leader.|speech
70|VOICE ON PHONE (o.s. filter)|How long before you get in there?|speech
71|MAN WITH TATTOO|Fifteen minutes.|speech
72||"INT   AN OFFICE   DAWN
A SUIT talks on a red telephone. Once again, we see no face.
An ostentatious diamond RING kicks light as the man snips off
the end off a Monte Cristo."|stage direction
73|MAN WITH RING|"You're good, soldier. But not that
good. It's five hundred miles away.
In the backwoods of Pennsylvania."|speech
74|MAN WITH TATTOO (o.s. filter)|"We have troopers on site. A first-
strike force. Under cover."|speech
75||The flame from a wooden match lights the Monte Cristo.|stage direction
76|MAN WITH RING|"Very resourceful.  You have my
permission activate them."|speech
77||EXT   AIR BASE   DAWN|stage direction
78|MAN WITH TATTOO|"I've already done that. You have my
permission... to say that you gave me
permission."|speech
79||"THE TATTOOED MAN runs off to join the other SOLDIERS.
INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
CHRIS sleeps. JILL is awake, deep in thought, when...
...BRRRRT! It's not a ring, it's a vibration. Jill reaches
down and extracts something small and black, the size of a
box of Tic-Tacs, from one of her shoes. She gets out of bed,
checking to see that Chris is still asleep, and moves into...
Pg-8
INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   BATHROOM   MORNING
...a bathroom. Closing the door behind her, she puts the
small box to her ear, extracts a wire from it, with a tiny
microphone on its tip, and..."|stage direction
80|JILL|(Softly) Valentine.|speech
81||We can't hear the voice that speaks to her.|stage direction
82|JILL (cont.)|"If this is just another a drill,
I'll strangle you. (She listens)
Shit. Give me the activation code."|speech
83||"JILL pulls a small ENVELOPE from a toiletry bag. She breaks
open a wax seal...and takes out a thick paper on which is
printed... 29-RC-6735."|stage direction
84|JILL (cont.)|"(Gaping, not believing) Th-that's
a match. (Beat) I'm on my way."|speech
85||"Jill clicks off. She dumps something else from the envelope
into her hand... A BLUE PLASTIC CARD, the size of a Visa,
blank except for a mag-stripe. There's a small hole in one
corner, through which a chain is strung. Jill slings the
chain over head, wearing the blue card like a pendant.
INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
CHRIS is still asleep. JILL comes out of the bathroom and
looks down at him longingly.  Should she wake him?  Tell him
what's happening?  She wants to, but duty prevents it.  She
pulls herself away.
INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   CLOSET   MORNING
TCHIK TCHIK TCHIK...JILL pushes aside hangers which hold her
clothes. She types numbers into a hidden KEYPAD. A SECRET
PANEL OPENS, revealing a CLOSET WITHIN THE CLOSET, packed
with COMBAT UNIFORMS and WEAPONS.
INT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
The sound... TCHUNG... of the front door closing snaps CHRIS
awake.  His first thought is for his lover.  He reaches out
and finds that... she's not in bed.  He jumps up, rushes to
a window, looks down, from the second story, and sees...
Pg-9
EXT   JILL'S APARTMENT   MORNING
...JILL, heavily ARMED, in UNIFORM, wearing a beret that has
an insignia... S.T.A.R.S. She rushes down the front path and
jumps into A HUMMER with THREE OTHER TROOPERS on board. The
vehicle pulls instantly away...
...leaving Chris, looking through the window, puzzled, angry,
and very much wounded.
INT/EXT   HUMMER   MORNING
RUSSO drives. WILLIAMS and DISIMONE sit in the back, all
tough Special-Forces types. JILL, in the front passenger
seat, though the only female, ranks the highest."|stage direction
86|DISIMONE|Another practice run, right?|speech
87|RUSSO|"We been practicin' six months!
For what?"|speech
88|JILL|For this. This is the real deal.|speech
89|WILLIAMS|Honest to God?|speech
90|JILL|"Based on my experience, Williams,
God isn't always honest"|speech
91|DISIMONE|Where we goin'?|speech
92|JILL|In there.|speech
93||"Jill points into THE ARKLEY FOREST which lies ahead. Miles
of old growth-trees shrouded in a ghostly morning mist.
DISSOLVE TO:
EXT   THE FOREST   MORNING
DEEP IN THE HEART OF THE MIST... THE HUMMER bounces over
non-roads and stops fifty yards from...
...A PAIR OF IRON GATES, each wrought with the letter ""A"".
Beyond, the shifting fog offers momentary glimpses of...
A MANSION.  Huge.  Like Xandau.  THE TROOPERS, amazed,
climb out and approach the gates.
Pg-10"|stage direction
94|RUSSO|"If you had the jing to build a place
like this, would you build it in the
middle of fuckin' nowhere?"|speech
95|WILLIAMS|Paris.|speech
96|DISIMONE|Manhattan. Upper west.|speech
97|JILL|"(Wistfully) Some people prefer...
a quiet life. (Back to business)
Our orders are to secure the area."|speech
98|DISIMONE|"From what? This area's been 'secure'
since the French and Indian War!"|speech
99||"A deep, animal SNARL comes from the woods.  The troopers
raise their weapons as they peer into the underbrush.  The
fog keeps sunlight from penetrating.  The forest is a maze
of dark shadows. Leaves flutter.  Limbs SNAP.  Then...
DARK SHAPES can be seen moving, circling.  A half-dozen
of them.  Maybe more.  Jill whips out a transmitter and
quickly types an access code."|stage direction
100|JILL|"(Into radio) This is Valentine,
Bravo Team. We, er... we might be
in trouble, here."|speech
101||"KRITCH! Something LEAPS out of the brush. Automatic
WEAPONS SPIT reflexively.
KRITCH KRITCH KRITCH...more lunging SHAES appear. The
troopers scatter, firing, as they are attacked from all
sides. Jill dives for the shrubbery, shouting into her
transmitter."|stage direction
102|JILL (cont.)|WE ARE IN TROUBLE!|speech
103||"CUT TO :
INT   HUEY   MORNING
JILL'S VOICE stutters over a headset which is pressed against
A MAN'S EAR."|stage direction
104|JILL (o.s. filter)|"Under attack... by.. .assailants...
Unidentifi..."|speech
105||"Pg-11
Static. Hissing air. The SHOT WIDENS as the man lowers his
headset. First we see the TATTOO on his arm... a grinning
SKULL which we recognize. Then, gradually, we see his face.
Lean and mean, wearing dark sunglasses, this is ALBERT
WESKER, a hard-assed career officer."|stage direction
106|WESKER|Can you get a trace?|speech
107||The pilot, LAGUARDIA, responds.|stage direction
108|LAGUARDIA|"Lost the beacon. It just cut out.
Like it was...swallowed by something."|speech
109||Oddly, Wesker smiles.|stage direction
110|WESKER|"I do believe, gentlemen...that we're
gonna be earning some combat pay."|speech
111||"There are three other MEN on board. The closest to Wesker
is BARRY BURTON, a muscular black man, as big as a grizzly,
with the heart of a Teddy."|stage direction
112|BARRY|Damn, if you don't love a fight.|speech
113|WESKER|"Hey, if I didn't... you'd be a dead
man. (To the pilot) Call in a nine-
nine. I want Raccoon City e-vacked."|speech
114||"Wesker and the men fly from the lens.  THE CAMERA passes
Out through one of the helicopter's windows as the chopper soars
away.  When the SHOT WIDENS, we see OTHER HUEYS...black,
unmarked, keeping formation.  Three... six...ten of them.
EXT   FOREST   MORNING
GUNS BLAZE. THE TROOPERS are under assault by thrashing,
inhuman SHAPES...GROWLING, SNAPPING. JILL rolls into a
natural trench.  DISIMONE is behind her, WILLIAMS is
crawling just ahead, his legs pumping.  Jill scoots past
him and sees that...
...those legs aren't moving on their own.  They've been
RIPPED AWAY FROM WILLIAMS' TORSO and are being dragged into
the underbrush by some... BEAST... concealed in the thick
brush, so we never get a clear look at it.
OTHER BEASTS attack DiSimone.  Then Russo.  We see only
details.  Jill fires her pistol, point blank... to no avail.
RED-RIMMED EYES, SNARLING JAWS, DROOLING TEETH descend on
her as we CUT TO:
Pg-12
EXT   JILL'S APARTMENT BUILDING   MORNING
CHRIS steps out of Jill's building. Suddenly, incongruously,
camo-painted HUEYS swoop down out of the sky.
EXT   RACCOON CITY   MAIN STREET   MORNING
THE CHOPPERS land where they can. COMMANDOS leap out and
begin to cordon off the town.  Bullhorns blare.
BULLHORN
There's been an accident in the
hills nearby. A military aircraft,
carrying live weapons, has crashed...
EXT   RACCOON CITY   SIDE STREET   MORNING
CHRIS runs down a side-street into AN ALLEY, where he's
trapped by COMMANDOS, both in front and behind."|stage direction
115|SOLDIER|"Let's go, hayseed. (Aiming his M-16)
You gonna be a good boy?"|speech
116||"Chris swallows his fury. Gritting his teeth, he goes along
with the soldiers, prodded, by rifle barrels, out onto...
EXT   RACCOON CITY  MAIN STREET   MORNING
...Main Street, where there is CHAOS... an Orwellian sight,
as CITIZENS find themselves horded into helicopters and
TRUCKS from the local National Guard Post.
A sweating man, still in his pajamas, rushes up to the
SOLDIERS that are escorting CHRIS."|stage direction
117|MAN|Look here, I'm the Sheriff of this...|speech
118|SOLDIER|Step aside.|speech
119|SHERIFF|But, I'm the Sheriff! An ex-Army man, like you.|speech
120|BULLHORN (o.s.)|"There is no immediate danger, but
as a precaution, we are evacuating
the area. You will be provided
shelter until the weapons have been
removed from the crash site."|speech
121||Pg-13|stage direction
122|SHERRIFF|"That's a worn-out scenario. If
a plane crashed nearby, don't you
think somebody would have heard
it go down? Tell us the truth,
guys. What's this really about?"|speech
123|SOLDIER|I said, STEP ASIDE!|speech
124||"The soldier lifts his rifle. He's about to CLUB the sheriff
when Chris lunges, grabbing his arm. WHOOMPH! Chris kicks
the soldier in the balls. The man buckles. Chris bolts.
One of the other commandos FIRES at him, a loud BURST which
misses Chris but SHATTERS a shop window, setting off wild
PANIC on the street. Chris ducks into a building...
EXT   RACCOON CITY   BACK STREET   MORNING
...and out a rear door. He runs through a warren of back
alleyways, arriving at...
...A JEEP SAHARA which is parked behind Jill's apartment
building. He jumps in without opening the door, jams the key
into the ignition, and ROARS off.
INT   HUEY   MORNING
Still airborne, in one of the black helicopters that have yet
to reach the site, WESKER barks orders into a radio."|stage direction

Raccoon City. Assist the e-vack.
I'm going on target with Alpha Team.
All forces stand ready to support."|speech
126||"EXT   FARM   MORNING
CHRIS rumbles his jeep onto a picturesque FARM, secluded deep
in the forest. We don't recognize it immediately. It was
dark when we last saw the place.
Jumping out, Chris sees three large SHAPES lying in the grass
of a corral. Rushing over, Chris realizes...
...they're HORSES. One of them is LUCKY, his prize
stallion... DEAD, in a pool of BLOOD, with its belly torn
open and a huge chunk out of its neck."|stage direction
127|CHRIS|Aw, no... (Devastated) ...L-Lucky.|speech
128||"Pg-14
Chris hears a weak, MOANING SOUND. He turns and sees...
RAKE, lying near a water pump. Chris rushes to the man's
side and finds him brutally SLASHED, barely clinging to life."|stage direction

outta the trees, Reddy. Don't... don't

some kinda... wolves, or somethin' ..."|speech

Never even...had a chance to...turn
a gun on 'em."|speech
136||"There's a THUNDER in the sky. Chris looks up. Wesker's

altitude."|stage direction

142|CHRIS (cont.)|"I'm not gonna bullshit you, Rake.
You're...in a bad time. If there's
any way to save you, I'll find it,
I swear. You just... hang in there,
old guy. I'll be right back."|speech
143||"Chris jumps to his feet and runs into...
INT   FARMHOUSE   MORNING
...the great-room of the FARMHOUSE. Rustic. Cozy. CHRIS
snatches up a telephone. There's no dial-tone. The line
is dead. Chris rushes to a gun cabinet and pulls out an old
WINCHESTER rifle. He scoops ammo from a drawer into a
shoulder bag and runs back outside...
EXT   FARM   MORNING
...where his eyes catch MOVEMENT in the corral. LUCKY,
entrails spilling, is trying to stand."|stage direction
144|CHRIS|Oh, God, Rake. Oh, Jesus, the poor thing's still alive.|speech
145||"Chris shoulders his ammo bag, reaches inside, and quickly
reloads the Winchester. Stepping forward, he aims carefully."|stage direction
146|CHRIS (cont.)|Sorry, old hoss.|speech
147||"BLAM!  A clean shot to the horse's brain drops the animal.
It takes Chris a long moment to recover... then, he looks into
the trees. The helicopters are no longer in sight, but their
THUNDER remains.  They haven't landed yet.
Chris turns and rushes back to Rake's side, only to find...
...he has died. Chris' jaws tighten, but he has no time
to mourn. He closes Rake's eyes. Digs through the grass.
Pulls up a handful of dirt. Stuffs it into the old man's
hand, and closes his stiffening fingers over it."|stage direction
148|CHRIS (cont.)|The earth keeps us.|speech
149||"Conquering his emotions, Chris runs to his jeep and jumps in.
He shifts into four-wheel-drive and, ignoring the road, heads
straight over the field for the trees.
As the jeep disappears, THE CAMERA CRANES DOWN, ZOOMING
IN ON...
Pg-16
...one of the farm dogs. The SPANIEL. Not the entire
animal, but one of its three SEPARATE PARTS... it's front
end... CRUSHED head, BLOODY neck, and a single BROKEN paw...
...which is trying to CRAWL.
Fifty yards away, RAKE'S HAND relaxes. The earth spills out
through his fingers as the dead man's eyes... POP OPEN.
EXT   ARKLEY FOREST   MORNING
THE FIRST OF THE BLACK HUEYS drops, hazardously, into a
small clearing with barely enough space. Unable to land
on the scrub-brush, it hovers ten feet off the ground. Its
rotors CLIP TREE LEAVES as WESKER, BARRY, and TWO OTHER
S.T.A.R.S. COMMANDOS jump out, heavily armed. The chopper
lifts off, placed by HUEY NUMBER TWO.
NOT FAR AWAY, CHRIS navigates through undergrowth until he
can see THE HELICOPTERS through the trees. The THUNDER from
their rotors masks the grinding of Chris' jeep. He pulls
within a hundred yards and, leaving his vehicle in the bush,
moves closer, cautiously, on foot.
THE THIRD HUEY air-drops TWO MEN and TWO WOMEN in S.T.A.R.S.
uniforms. There are TWELVE COMMANDOS in all... ALPHA TEAM.
Wesker looks up at the Huey's PILOT, using his radio to speak

NERVOUS CHATTER. Chris watches a MONKEY sip water from a

into the lab. The thing with. the destroyed face turns toward
the invaders, stands, and shuffles toward them.

their flesh rotting, leaking pus.
The largest of them SNAPS at Chris, but its jaws catch only
a clump of his swirling hair. Chris kicks with his feet,
remaining upright, and FIRES his wet Winchester.

the shark, but barely. We can see the casing lodged in the
animal's flesh.

of his Winchester directly against the aquarium glass...
only to find himself aiming directly at...

pressure...on his ear.
A groping zombie has accidentally hooked its fingers onto the
wire that runs from the detonator to Wesker's ear-piece.
For a breathless moment, it seems like the sensor will be
popped loose. Holding the pulse-reader in place, Wesker
twists his body, lifts his hand gun, and PUMPS THREE into
the dead thing's brain.
The zombie flops over, but its fingers cling, entangled, in
the wire. Wesker plants his pistol barrel on the knuckles

through layers of fat until he reaches a bloody CAVITY.

delays the snake for two seconds.
