is a truck-stop coffee shop beside the roadway. A few 14-WHEELERS
are scattered across the big dusty parking lot. Morning sunlight
glints off their chrome stacks. It bakes the asphalt and warms the
mangy hides of stray DOGS asleep in the dirt. A HELICOPTER hovers
about the treetops like a lazy hummingbird. It's the beginning of a
perfect day.
A highway PATROL CAR slowly trolls among the trucks and dogs and
parks beside the slat and shingled building.
TWO TELEPHONE LINEMEN are scaling a power pole at the forest's edge."|unknown

to work, their bodies forming a ""Y."" One of them suddenly turns,
pointing at a nearby treetop.
FIRST LINEMAN
Lookee there!
He grabs a PORCELAIN INSULATOR from his belt, cocks his arm and
hurls it across the open stretch. It lands smack in the middle of
the tree. SQUAWK! A rattle of leaves, a rustle of feathers and a
HUGE BUZZARD comes flapping out. The lineman cackles over his
marksmanship."|unknown

face the man beside him.
MAN
That's really a beaut...really a
beaut!
The MAN is staring at the TATOO which shows below the rolled-up
sleeve of Cameron's shirt, a large American Eagle with elaborate
scrollwork and a patriotic slogan. The man pulls up his own sleeve
to show a small tatoo of an anchor.
MAN (CONT'D)
My wife still yells about this...but
yours -- that's some eagle...like a

Then suddenly, Cameron bolts, desperately springing full speed for
the back door. He flings it open. The cops are moving toward him.
One has almost got his gun out.
POLICEMAN
Cameron!   Halt! I'll shoot!
Cameron lunges through the doorway, not realizing in his frenzy the
screen door still blocks his path. He tears through it, but gets
stuck halfway.
CAMERON
(panicked)
No!...God, don't shoot!
Swinging his manacled arms like a club against the tangled mesh, he
breaks free and runs."|unknown
42||14   EXT.   REAR OF DINER|location
43||"As Cameron flies down the back steps, a COP stationed at the rear
door, caught off-guard, tries to stop him but is shoved flat on his
back. Cameron weaves and scrambles across the yard, over fences,
between the shed and the barn, rolling beneath a building, out the
other side. Behind him, distant shouts and a gunshot."|unknown
44||15   INT.   FOREST - MOVING SHOT ON CAMERON - DAY|location
45||"As Cameron runs, he moves with a skill that suggests forests are not
alien to him. He crouches low, following tiny avenues in the maze
of tree trunks, scrambling on all fours over needles and fallen
cones. Sweat pours down his face. His breath rasps in his throat.
He breaks into a clearing and FREEZES...suddenly face to face with a
MAN who crouches, blocking his path. It is one of the telephone
linemen we saw earlier."|unknown

The other lineman is halfway up the power pole. They both stare at
Cameron's handcuffs. Cameron edges back, his escape route blocked.
The man on the ground grabs a WRENCH and moves forward with the same
gleam in his eye we saw when he scared that bird from the tree.
LINEMAN
Stand right there like a good old
boy and do what I say. You wanna
try and mess with me, you've had
fair warning. I was a combat Marine
in Korea. Okay?

The lineman advances on him as Cameron backs away.
CAMERON
Korea? No shit, so was my old
man..."|unknown

Aaaaaaaargh!
The lineman jumps in surprise. Then, enraged like a startled bull,
he lunges forward with the wrench. Cameron uses the man's weight
against him, his moves those of a trained fighter. A hard knee to
his stomach doubles up the lineman. The handcuffed arms slam down
like a club between his shoulder blades driving him to the ground.
A kick thrown sideways to his head and the man is out. The other
lineman who had started to descend the pole freezes and takes one
step back up. Cameron grabs the lineman's toolbox in his handcuffed
grasp and dashes off into the forest."|unknown
49||17   MOVING SHOT - ON CAMERON|location
50||"He slides down a slope on a carpet of fallen leaves, tumbling to the
bottom and falls face forward into a running stream where he holds
his head and drinks. CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the terrain. There are no
pursuers, the forest is silent."|unknown
51||18   CLOSE UP - HANDCUFFS|location
52||"The jaws of a wire-cutter clamp down severing the chain connecting
the cuffs around Cameron's wrists. He lifts his knee from the
cutter handle. His arms are now free. He wedges a chisel against
one bracelet and swings a sledgehammer against it. We hear his
sharp outcry."|unknown
53||19   ANGLE ON CAMERON|location

intact. He buttons his shirt cuffs over the metal bands and climbs
the slope to the bright sunlight on the road above."|unknown

56||"Cameron is trudging along the old road winding down through the
mountainous pass. He crosses a bridge. Through the arches of its
low stone railing, he sees a BLACK RIVER twenty feet below rushing
toward the sea. Then, glancing back, he is suddenly alert.

57||21   CAMERON'S POV|location
58||"In the far distance, almost lost in the shimmering heat waves from
the road, is a tiny speck moving toward him."|unknown
59||22   ANGLE ON CAMERON|location
60||"He clambers down the embankment behind the railing, peering out from
this hidden vantage."|unknown
61||23   ANGLE ON ROAD|location
62||"The speck grows larger. The SOUND of the engine is faintly audible
now. Sunlight flashes from metal and glass. Cameron's apprehension
suddenly changes to wonderment, for the vehicle is not the police as
he had feared, but something else. Moving in the shimmering heat
wave is a splendid, high, humpbacked World War I vintage DUESENBERG
SEDAN with gleaming brass headlights, roaring towards him."|unknown
63||24   ANGLE ON CAMERON|location
64||"He scrambles up the embankment to thumb a ride. The Duesenberg
roars past him, filling his eyes and mouth with dust. Suddenly
there is a screech of brakes."|unknown
65||25   ANGLE ON CAR|location
66||"The Duesenberg goes into a skid and then bounces to a stop.
Running, Cameron reaches the car, pulls the front door open and
climbs in beside the DRIVER."|unknown
67||26   INT.   CAR|location
68||"CAMERON
Thanks.    I thought you didn't see
me.
The driver, BURT, is a husky, red-haired man about Cameron's age and
deeply agitated. Pounding his fist against the steering wheel, he
talks half to Cameron, half to himself.
BURT
Damn it.    Screwed it up.   Lost my
nerve.
Fishing a Vick's inhaler from his pocket and shoving it in his
nostril.

BURT (CONT'D)
Goddamn sinuses. Can't even see
straight.
Cameron looks at him, puzzled.
CAMERON
You want me to drive?
Burt whirls on him, enraged.
BURT
What the hell is that supposed to
mean?!
CAMERON
(confused)
No offense...thought you might...
BURT
Every one of you jerks is a goddamn
hotshot expert! Thanks for the vote
of confidence. If you think you can
do any better, just come and try it!
He puts his boot in Cameron's stomach and shoves hard."|unknown
69||27   EXT.   CAR|location
70||"Cameron comes flying out and lands on his back in the road as the
Duesenberg squeals forward, its open door slamming shut from the
momentum.
Stunned, the wind knocked out of him, Cameron rises to his elbows.
Before the old relic has gone thirty yards, again the brakes
screech, swinging the car into a sliding salute turn, one hundred-
eighty degrees and it is suddenly screaming back toward Cameron."|unknown

73||29   ANGLE ON ROAD - CAR AND CAMERON|location
74||"Cameron, sprawled on the road, is momentarily paralyzed at the sight
of the Duesenberg's great brass grill bearing down. His hand closes
over a rock and with the same illogical gesture that a soldier
flings a Coke bottle at a tank, Cameron hurls the rock in the
direction of the car and frantically rolls sideways. The big
spinning tires brush him as they pass. We catch a momentary glimpse
of the rock smashing against the gleam of the passing windshield.
As he stops rolling, once more face down in the dust, eyes closed,
expecting death, he becomes aware there is only silence. He opens
his eyes, climbs to his feet. The road is empty. The Duesenberg is
gone. Astonished, confused -- he walks to the side of the bridge
where the railing ends and the car might have plunged off. There is
nothing below but the rushing black water. Here and there bubbles
swirl to the surface. They could be from a sinking car or could be
caused by the current."|unknown
75||30   ANGLE ON CAMERON|location
76||"His thoughts racing. Was it the sun, has he imagined the whole
thing? Suddenly a HELICOPTER appears, hovering, almost at eye
level. Sunlight flashes through the spinning blades like a strobe."|unknown
77||31   WIDER ANGLE|location
78||"It is the same helicopter we saw in the opening sequence. It has
swiftly descended beside the bridge just beyond the railing,
catching Cameron with no chance to run or hide. FOUR MEN Can be
seen inside the plastic cockpit barely a few feet away. The man
beside the PILOT is ELI CROSS. He grabs the radio microphone and
begins speaking into it. Cameron whirls, scrambles down a bank to a
field. The helicopter drops to within a few feet of the water,
hovers. Protected from sight, Cameron runs between the tall stalks,
away from the road."|unknown
79||32   CAMERON - MOVING SHOT|location
80||"Glancing back through the stalks as he runs, Cameron sees a STAKE
TRUCK barreling toward the sight of the accident. In the back,
THREE MEN are frantically putting on black wet-suits. They look,
from this distance, like little black toys tumbling against each
other. Cameron runs on.

81||33    EXT.   BLUFF - OVERLOOKING SEASHORE TOWN|location
82||"A few hotels, like a cluster of old Victorian gingerbread, surround
a sandy cove beyond which is the sea. There is a fishing pier,
boardwalk, hot dog stands, pizza parlors, all swarming with
sunbathing TOURISTS. The town's bucolic, turn-of-the-century charm
might even survive these, if not for a monstrous yellow CONSTRUCTION
CRANE, which juts ten stories into the sky from the center of the
sandy cove. Cameron appears on the bluff."|stage direction
83||34    ANGLE ON CAMERON|location
84||"Surveying the town -- expressionless, a jungle beast going to
survive no matter what -- at least for a few more hours. He reaches
down and rips off his trouser legs at the thigh, turning them into
cutoffs a vacationing bather might wear. He pulls off his worn
boots and flings them into the brush, his eyes never leaving the
town below. There are crowds to get lost in down there. He
unbuttons his sleeve and looks at the handcuff still encircling his
wrist. Stopping beside a large rock, he smashes the bracelet
against it. It won't open. Grimacing in pain, he re-buttons the
sleeve, opens his shirt and begins descending the palisades toward
the town."|stage direction

THE ANGLE WIDENS and we realize the words are on the back of a
YELLOW HAT that jiggles as its wearer walks. It is Cameron. Beyond
him we see the tide of tourists in oils and ointments flirting with
the sun. Teenage girls at portable toilets adjusting their bikinis.
The boardwalk cops in white shirts, looking like ice cream vendors,
whom Cameron deftly avoids. Then, he looks up at the sky,
perplexed: the helicopter from the bridge is overhead, circling.
Cameron watches it warily as he walks."|stage direction

All right, people. Quiet! We're
losing the sun! This is a take!
You're welcome to watch, but please,
no flashbulbs. They'll spoil the

Cameron's world has become more ordered again. It's a film company
shooting on location -- this somehow must explain the Duesenberg.
His eyes go to the scene below."|unknown

93||"A CAMERA RIG suspended from the end of the yellow construction crane
is PHOTOGRAPHING the surf where EXTRAS in German WWI uniforms

toward the soldiers, its engine whining. From here it looks as
fearsome as Snoopy and the Red Baron."|unknown
94||37   ANGLE ON THE BEACH|location

explosion. In the flash of smoke and flame, barge, rowboats,
ammunition and people are blown sky-high. The smoke from the
exploding ammunition momentarily obscures the scene."|unknown

pleasure turns to horror and disbelief."|unknown

Mr. Bailey! Aren't you Raymond
Bailey, the actor? Would you please
sign your autograph? Write 'to

concerned. Sam looks at the others, shrugs and approaches Eli,
squatting beside him on the sand pile.

idling toward the sea. It is a perfect day, tranquil except for the
faint distant ""rumbling"" intruding into our consciousness. As it
grows louder and LOUDER, a flock of birds is frightened from the
trees, a rusty beer can by the roadside begins to tremble and roll
from the vibration.
Rounding the bend of the road into view are a half-dozen kids on
bicycles, peddling furiously, laughing and yelling and looking back
at what now appears behind them: the first vehicle of an incredible
carnival parade -- or is it a funeral procession? Long, short,
tall, fat vehicles; the stretch-out car, the cab towing portable
toilets, the tractor pulling a generator rig, the Cortez Camper
dressing rooms, the stake-bed loaded with reflectors rattling like
radar screens, panel trucks with studio emblems, a vintage German
army truck filled with soldiers, patrol cars and motorcycles, the
huge, bright yellow construction crane on its Caterpillar treads,
its pneumatic snout jutting forward thirty yards like a morning
hard-on sniffing around for some tunnel to hump -- a few technicians
straddle it having their morning Danish and coffee. In the midst of
these, on a low-slung flatbed trailer rides the Duesenberg -- the
coffin on its caisson.

gently taps. He must get Nina out of there. With determination, he
reaches for the trunk handle. Arms wearing the same costume as his
own reach in, holding the trunk closed. It is Raymond."|stage direction

his identity been exposed? His eyes widen. The technician, getting
no response, calls to Jake."|location

ON?"|speech
1424||"Cameron realizes his error, but it's too late, he's in a panic. In
his mind, he's given himself away. The road ahead is clear -- GO!

Duesenberg leaps forward, screeching wildly. In its wake -- chaos.
Everyone running, yelling..."|location

Hang on to everything, baby, we're
on our way! You okay?"|unknown
1433||"The needle hits eighty -- eighty-five. Ahead, the bridge is rushing
toward us. Now the arches of the stone railing are strobing past.
Through them, he sees the black river which he has escaped.
Triumphantly, his hand rises, middle finger extended. Suddenly the
red camera light goes on, the underwater camera behind him begins
whirring. He moves his finger behind him for a perfect close-up,

1443||"The Duesenberg drops on one axle. Metal screams against stone, as
though it were Cameron himself, screaming. Skidding, spinning,
tearing through the papier-mache railing, plunging out of control
into space, where it hovers for a brief instant and arcs downward
like a dying bird."|stage direction

Ninaaa-a-a-a-a-!!!"|unknown
1447||198   INT.   DUESENBERG - WIDE ANGLE PAST CAMERON THROUGH WINDSHIELD|location
1448||"The river rushes up and the car smashes into it with a deafening,
shattering roar, plunging beneath the surface to a dark and
soundless world -- except for a tiny red light, the whir of a camera
and Cameron's desperate cries. Tearing his seatbelt off he flings
himself toward the rear of the car, clawing at the back seat to
reach Nina. Incredibly, there is sunlight again as the car is
buoyed to the surface. There, again, is the living world - the
road, the trees. In that brief instant, through the rear window,
Cameron has a wild, tilted glimpse of a pink pinafore -- Nina,
standing by the rail looking down, Eli beside her. The car noses
downward, water rising swiftly over the rear window. The last image
on Cameron's retina is that wild, eager, little-girl excitement on
Nina's face. Then he's alone again, entombed in the darkening water
as the car plunges toward the bottom.
Cameron sits, immobilized at the realization that his betrayal is
total. Everyone, even Nina, has conspired to bring him to this --
red light glowing, camera whirring, to capture the moment of his
death."|stage direction
1449||- 150 -|unknown
1450||"Outrage galvanizes him to action. He reaches for the door handles,
to rip them open -- they snap off in his hands. Now there is a
rumbling and rending of metal as the roof begins to implode,
crushing down toward him. Under the immense pressure, the rear
window bursts inward, the river rushing in a wild torrent. The
memory of Chuck's voice...""the windows."" He lowers the front window
slowly. The water now pours in faster. The level has risen to his
chin. He gasps a final breath and the water rises over his head.
Still the red light burns. He reaches beneath the seat for the
oxygen cylinder and tries to pull it loose. It won't move. The
impact of the car hitting the water has bent the seat frame. His
groping hand finds the hose, the oxygen mask. A hope. Though every
second is robbing his chance for life, his movements under water are
as in slow motion. Pulling the mask to his face, he takes an eager
breath and chokes as water fills his mouth. The rubber tube has
broken loose from the cylinder and is floating free -- as it must
have with Burt. Pressure of the onrushing water has stopped as the
water reaches the roof. For a moment there is a strange stillness
which Cameron, his lungs bursting, swims through, out the window and
toward the surface."|stage direction
1451||199   ANGLE ON CAMERON|location
1452||"Moving upward through river slime, in a world that grows lighter, in
a desperate race to reach air.
Daylight! Gasping, half unconscious, barely able to move his arms
to stay afloat. Adrift in the current, he touches land, clawing at
the rocks and pulling himself onto the shore. His muscles, still
moving by motor reflex, driven by survival instinct, take him
crawling from the river bank through the tall grass -- still the
fugitive, the ""man on the run."" Then, he lifts his head and stops
at what he sees before him:"|stage direction

closes, must irrevocably reach Cameron."|stage direction

1456||"It's over. Without strength or will, he lies waiting for them as
though his eyes were made of glass. They see him now, but their
pace doesn't change. As they take the last few steps toward him, he
sees their shoulders, waists, knees and then only a circle of feet
around him.
Their hands roughly grab him, pulling him to his feet, shoving him
brutally about. Angry cop faced growling: ""Kill the son-of-a-"|stage direction

it!"" He feels a blow on the back, then another. They seem too
gentle. Why is that cop smiling? Some of them are walking away.
Where are the handcuffs? Why is he shaking my hand instead? Then
the jumble of voices is becoming clearer...""No matter what they pay
you, make 'em give you a raise!""...""Fantastic, my wife thinks being
a cop is dangerous -- you guys are terrific!"" It finally sinks in,
the insane, absurd, devastating, humiliating realization that it was
all just another scene in a movie that came off as planned.
He is alive and free. Is that gurgle we hear in Cameron's throat
the water that he swallowed or an unseemly giggle? Then it chokes
into laughter."|stage direction

filled with elastic bandages. How funny. Here's the helicopter

who runs to meet him. How hilarious. There's the pink
pinafore...Nina holding the skirt up to her waist as she wades
through the tall grass towards him. How sweetly absurd."|stage direction
