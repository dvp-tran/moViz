into their faces and they react. MOVE TO REVEAL -
that the bright light is coming from a futuristic
CAMERA with a small bank of lights attached to it. The
camera is a holographic recorder with two lenses and is
worn on an operator's head. There are four JOURNALISTS
clustered in front of the Turbolift -- one associated
with the camera, the others using PADDS to make
notations.
Also clustered around the door are the BRIDGE CREW of

Starship Enterprise in thirty
years without James T. Kirk in
command. How do you feel about
that?"|location
82||"The Journalist has unknowingly touched a nerve. Kirk's
eyes flash for a moment -- the longer he's on this
Bridge, the more he realizes he doesn't feel good about
it at all. He tries to shrug it off with a smile."|stage direction

send her on her way..."|location

him."|stage direction

retired?"|location

was..."|location

height."|stage direction

couldn't have been more than..."|location

for a long beat. The expression on his face changes
from shock to sadness... Something is clearly
bothering him.
Scotty moves over to Kirk, with a smile on his face."|stage direction
103||(to Kirk)|unknown
104||Damn fine ship if you ask me...|location
105||"But Kirk's mind is still on Demora. He watches her as
she moves to the Helmsman's position."|stage direction
106||You know, Scotty... it amazes me.|location
107||And what would that be, sir?|location
108||"Sulu. When did he find the time
for a family?"|location
109||"It's like you always said -- if
something's important enough, you
make the time."|location
110||Kirk nods absently. Scotty realizes something...|stage direction
111||"So... that's why you've been
running around the galaxy like an
eighteen-year-old. Finding
retirement a little lonely, are we?"|location
112||Kirk gives him a look.|stage direction
113||"With that kind of tact, I'm glad
you're an engineer and not a
psychiatrist."|location

take your seats."|location

We're caught in some kind of
energy distortion. We can't break
free... need immediate help...
It' tearing us --"|location

OFFICER checks something on his console. The
Journalist with the Holo-camera turns on his light and
pans it around to capture the action."|stage direction

transporting El-Aurian refugees to
Earth."|location

unexpected turn of  events. Kirk watches him intently.

156||"The Holo-camera light is shined on Harriman as he
shifts in his seat, hesitant to take the plunge. Kirk
is drumming his fingers impatiently on his leg.
Finally, Harriman takes a breath and straightens his
jacket a bit."|stage direction

us."|location

and engage at maximum warp."|location

that won't work."|stage direction

interference, Captain."|location

solution, but it isn't easy -- it's his first day in

It's a nightmare come true. Kirk is itching to get in

but he restrains himself."|stage direction

the warp nacelles? That might
disrupt the ribbon's hold on the
ships."|location

plasma..."|location

to twelve percent, sir."|location

delicate moment -- Harriman doesn't want to look
incapable, but at the same time, he needs help."|stage direction

any... suggestions you might have."|location
