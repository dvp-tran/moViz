impact."|stage direction

strange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the
smoke-shrouded crater.  The ominous mechanical probe floats across the
snow plain and disappears into the distance."|stage direction
5||EXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY|location
6||"A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope.  The bundled
rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a Tauntaun.  Curving
plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged
beast.
The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop.  Pulling
off his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices something in the
sky.  He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and
through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed.
The wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink
transmitter.  His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him."|stage direction

There's a meteorite that hit the
ground near here.  I want to check
it out.  It won't take long."|speech

He pats the beast on the head to calm it."|stage direction
19|LUKE|"Hey, steady girl.  What's the
matter?  You smell something?"|speech
20||"Luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when
suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind.  He hears a
monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-tall shape towering over
him.  It is a Wampa Ice Creature, lunging at him ferociously."|stage direction
21|LUKE|Aaargh!|speech
22||"Luke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white
claw.  He falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified
screams of the Tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck
being broken.
The Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him away
across the frozen plain."|stage direction

their new base.  The rider, Han Solo, swings off his lizard and pulls
off his goggles.
He walks into the main hangar deck toward the Millennium Falcon, which
is parked among several fighters.  Mechanics, R2 units, and various
other droids hurry about.  Han stops at the Millennium Falcon where his
Wookiee copilot, Chewbacca, is welding on a central lifter.  Chewie
stops his work and lifts his face shield, growling an irritated
greeting to his boss."|stage direction

can't stay anymore."|speech

If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut,
I'm a dead man."|speech

me?  Afraid I was going to leave

ask you to turn on the thermal
heater.  I merely commented that it
was freezing in the princess'

Skywalker is?"|speech

what's going on?"|speech

128||"The jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of
a Hoth day.  Luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy
stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor.  One
side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood.  He opens
his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the
gorge walls.  Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and
futilely tries to unfasten the throngs.
Exhausted, he drops back into his hanging position.  As he hangs there,
he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about
three feet out of reach.
He focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he
squeezes his eyes tight in concentration.
Just as the ice creature looms over Luke, the lightsaber jumps into
Luke's hand.
The young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts
himself loose from the ice.  He flops to the snow in a heap.  The
startled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking.  Luke
scrambles to his feet.  He swings his lightsaber and the beast screams
in pain."|stage direction

There's really nothing more we can
do.  And my joints are freezing up."|speech

course we'll see Master Luke again.
He'll be quite all right, you'll see."|speech

keeps his vigil."|stage direction

the princess."|stage direction

range is far too weak to abandon
all hope."|speech

151|LIEUTENANT|Yes, sir.|speech

series of efficient beeps."|stage direction

are seven hundred seventy-five...
to one."|speech

cavern.  Chewie lets out another suffering howl."|stage direction

make mistakes... from time to time.
Oh, dear, oh, dear.  Don't worry

Han pulls up and leaps off his mount.  He hurries to his snow-covered
friend, cradling him in his arms.  Han's Tauntaun lets out a low,
pitiful bellow.  But Han's concern is with Luke, and he shakes him
urgently."|stage direction
168|HAN|"Luke!  Luke!  Don't do this, Luke.
Come on, give me a sign here."|speech
169||"Luke doesn't respond.  Han begins frantically rubbing and slapping
Luke's unconscious face.  As he starts to lift the youth, Han hears a
rasping sound behind him.  He turns, just in time to see his Tauntaun
stagger and then fall over into the snow.
Han carries Luke to the moaning beast.  Then, with a final groan, the
Tauntaun expires."|stage direction

the walker's hull, reaching a small hatch.  Hanging precariously, Luke
cuts the solid metal hatch with his laser sword.

Chewie's back, with only his head, torso, and one arm assembled, is
Threepio.  Threepio's head faces the opposite direction from Chewie's
