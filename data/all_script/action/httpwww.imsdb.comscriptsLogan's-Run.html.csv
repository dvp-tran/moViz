PLEASE NOTE THE CRYSTAL WILL BE USED IN THE
LEFT HAND OF ALL CHARACTERS.
FADE IN:
BEFORE AND DURING  TITLES
1		EXT. - SKY NIGHT
The moon and stars are visible, but as CAMERA looks down, the SCREEN
fills with dark, billowing clouds. CAMERA moves into the clouds and
just  as they blank out the SCREEN, a distant shimmer of light
becomes visible.  Moving toward it, the shimmer becomes
2		EXT. - DOME OF GLASS - NIGHT
A glowing but not transparent structure stretching off into the
clouds  that press it. CAMERA continues to move in until the
detailed structural  webbing of the dome fills the SCREEN and then
CAMERA MOVES THROUGH IT and  we see
3		EXT. - THE CITY - DAY
Shining below the dome (which we now see as a series of dome-like
structures standing off without end) -a marvelous crystalline city
of  great openness, building clusters, green plazas, fountains...
multi-leveled  but human scale, crisscrossed by the flickering clear
tubes of the MAZE- CARS.
4		CLOSER ANGLE - ROOFTOPS
As a MAZE-CAR slides softly to a stop.
5		ROOFTOP - THE RUNNER
The hatch opens and a MAN in a hurry leaves the maze-car and runs
swiftly  along the rooftop and disappears into an open elevator
which instantly  starts to descend.
6		INT - RESIDENCE PLAZA - THE ELEVATOR
From a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down from a
great  height.  As it reaches the courtyard the RUNNER darts out,
pushes into  the crowd.
7 		OUT
8		WITH THE RUNNER
As he reappears around a corner, skirts a brimming pool and makes
for a  kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out of the
courtyard. He is  moving even faster now, glancing back as if he
fears pursuit.
9		ANOTHER ANGLE - CORRIDOR
Above, at the railing of an oval light well, dressed in black and
silver,   a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in one hand
-- and watching.  It is FRANCIS.
10		WITH THE RUNNER
Moving rapidly down the corridor, he suddenly stops as if feeling
the  presence above. He looks up, sees the SANDMAN and his face
breaks in  terror. He wheels, frantic, screaming, runs back into the
hall.
11		THE SANDMAN (FRANCIS)
Vaulting the rail, dropping lightly to ground level, weapon poised.
12		P.O.V.
The crowd melting, parting to reveal the Runner backed against the
pool.  People are YELLING, shaking their fists, terribly excited and
fearful.
13		THE SANDMAN
Emotionless. Aims. Fires.
14		THE RUNNER - CLOSE
Seeming to burst aflame in the LENS, then slipping BELOW FRAME to
reveal  Francis sauntering forward, holstering his weapon. The crowd
closing in  behind him, applauding, congratulating him.
15		THE SANDMAN
Arriving at the pool where the body lies, half immersed. He leans
over,  lifts the right hand from the water, revealing a palm with a
black  flowercrystal shape in it. He lets the hand fall back now as
the crowd   CHEERS and APPLAUDS him.
16		EXTREME CLOSE UP - HAND - IN THE WATER - (INSERT)
Closing in until the crystal fills the SCREEN.
MATCH DISSOLVE TO:
(TITLES END)
17		CLOSE UP - CRYSTAL - (INSERT)
Clear, sparkling, flower-like. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal
18		INT. - NURSERY CORRIDOR
The crystal is in the hand of a sleeping INFANT who is behind glass
in  one of many cubicles. Standing outside, looking in, LOGAN, dimly
lit in   the soft glow of the cubicle where the sleeping infant
lies, swaddled and  coccooned in the rosy auto-tender which caters
to the baby's every need.  Faint MUSIC bubbles like distant
laughter.
19		OUT
19X1		LOGAN
Logan is twenty-five, strong, virile (yet sensitive) with a kind of
austere grace.
He is somewhat manic...proud...as he peers through the nursery
window  into a kind of foam cocoon which cradles THREE SLEEPING
INFANTS. Logan is  KNOCKING on the soundless glass."|stage direction

28||"Francis starts to pry at the Panel...knowing it  will sound an
ALARM."|stage direction
29|LOGAN|Hey, cut that out !|speech
30||"Too late: There is a SOUND OF ALARM CHIMES. The area in which they

54|FRANCIS (peering|Why?|speech

But who would want to find out?"|speech
57||"One of the doorways brightens and the word ARCADE _ appears on it.
The  two men move to the spot as a maze-car stops. They enter it
through the  doorway which dims behind them as the maze-car WHOOSHES
softly off into a  kind of twilight.
21		INT. - MAZE-CAR - LOGAN AND FRANCIS
The door slides shut. They sink into seat forms which yield to them.
They   move off.
22		EXT. - MAZE- CAR
Moving through the city at terrific speed. Giving us glimpses of the
city  as it goes. slowing finally as we see:
23		THE CITY - FEATURING ARCADE
Brightly lit, garish. We get only a glimpse as the maze-car
disappears  into a tunnel.
24		MAZE-CAR STATION - ARCADE
As the maze-car stops, opens and Logan and Francis exit into   a
gathering  CROWD.
25		FULL SHOT - ARCADE
Glittering, crowded. Throngs of people moving on many levels, some
walking, some on moving platforms. It's The Great White Way, Luna
Park --  you name it. Gaudy booths and entrances, featuring every
delight -- too  much to take in at a glance.
26		WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS
As they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it
notices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good-natured
argument continuing..."|stage direction
58|LOGAN|"but you don't know, you Just
say what everyone says.  One for
one. One for one."""|speech
59|FRANCIS|"Well, why no!? That's exactly how
everything works. How else could
the city stay in balance -You have
a better idea?"|speech
60|LOGAN (laughs)|"No, but at least I wonder sometimes --
instead of doing that ""one for one"" song
of yours. You sound like a sleepteacher
With a stuck tape."|speech
61|FRANCIS|"Well the minute you get a better
idea you can stop wondering."|speech
62||(beat)|location
63|FRANCIS|"You know, Logan -- you wonder
a lot. Too much for a Sandman"|speech
64||"They are passing the facade of a Relive Shop The signs urging people
to:  RELIVE YOUR MOST PRECIOUS MEMORIES. DO IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!
REFRESH AND  RENEW ANYTIME!!
As they cross the entrance, two men come out, grinning broadly,
falling  into step just ahead of Logan and Francis. Then one of the
men stops  abruptly, almost colliding with them. He mumbles an
apology and starts  back to RELIVE.
As he disappears into the RELIVE SHOP, his friend shrugs cheerfully
to  Logan and Francis and moves on.
27		ARCADE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NEW YOU
They are moving past a shop called NEW YOU #483 when a man comes
cannonading out, thrilled and excited. He rushes over to a pretty
young  woman who has been eying Logan and Francis, plants himself in
front of  her with his hands framing his face."|stage direction
65|MAN|Well? How do you like it?|speech
66|WOMAN (critically)|"I don't know. The cheeks maybe...

around,  smiles and goes off with a passer-by.

Signs promising LOVE, FULFILLMENT, RARE DELIGHTS. People streaming
in and  out. A woman comes out looking glazed, breathing
""yes...yes..."" As she  passes CAMERA Logan and Francis emerge from
the crowd and CAMERA moves  with them."|stage direction

tonight."|speech

81||"The crowd is growing denser, funneling into a kind of passageway.
Logan  and Francis are swallowed up in the group.
29		FULL SHOT - ARCADE GREAT HALL
An immense room into which the streams of people coming from the
entertainment area are mingling. There is a general air of
anticipation  stirring the crowd as CAMERA singles out Logan and
Francis entering,  waving to friends. CAMERA closes in on them just
as they reach a  beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to see
Francis. They embrace,  and as they break:"|stage direction

111||"They laugh, but the laughter is broken as a trio of youngsters,
moving  with erratic speed of lightning, smashes between them,
almost knocking  Francis over. He reels, Logan catches him and they
recover in time to see   the trio rip wildly through the crowd,
knocking people down, screaming  with shrill joy as they disappear."|stage direction

As everyone begins to move to the far end, where great  curtains
have parted to reveal
31		ARCADE GREAT HALL - CAROUSEL ENTRANCE
AC the far end of the hall, where the throng is a huge crystal
design ornaments an entrance  The crystal is red and pulsing
rhythmically to the accompaniment of a deep and thrilling  TONE. As
we move toward it with Logan and Francis, the TONE  deepens, the
great pulse takes on a hypnotic quality...
32		WITH LOGAN AND FRANCIS
In the crowd they overtake a fellow Sandman,  DANIEL, and fall in
step with him. When they  speak now, their voices are hushed."|stage direction

125||"Francis glances at him, exchanges a look with Daniel. They vanish
into the throng passing under the great crystal, turn the corner and
we see
33		FULL SHOT - CAROUSEL
framed in a huge corridor we see a steep-sided  arena dropping down
to a shadowy center, which  even now pulsates and flickers in
changing  dimensions, but always maintaining the jewel- flower
shape. There is one entrance into the center -- a kind of ramp from
below the seats, leading directly into the mysterious bowl --
Just now the seat's are filling, and the sense of expectation builds
People sit and immediately crane their necks, waiting...
34.		ANOTHER ANGLE
Featuring Logan and Francis as they find places in the arena. Like
the others, they crane upward. As they do, Logan gestures at a
number of pretty girls who are just being seated."|stage direction

his seed-mother."|speech
127|FRANCIS|Only a few? You're just not trying.|speech

37		PANNING THE CROWD
As the seats fill, the excitement builds. Suddenly the lights begin
to dim and dim...
SOUND: A kind of collective sigh, breathing in unison...
38 		OUT
38X1		ANGLE THE TIER BELOW THE SEATS
Suddenly visible, the LASTDAY GROUP. Their arms are upraised and in
each palm the crystal blinks red-black, red-black.
39		THE CROWD
Transfixed, gripped with a religious fervor.
40		LASTDAY GROUP
Hands still raised, filing slowly into the mysterious well of
Carousel.
41		CROWD
Tense, beginning nervous APPLAUSE here and there.
42		CAROUSEL
As the last one enters, beginning to glow and, as it does, the bowl
slowly puts out leaves like some great plant, enfolding and hiding
the people within a series of translucent petals. As the Last one
enfolds them the Light intensifies, the exterior surfaces seeming to
shift as if a kind of motion was beginning inside it...
43		CROWD
Visible in the growing Light from Carousel -gripped with passion and
excitement, APPLAUDING, gesturing as they see
44		CAROUSEL
Moving, bands of light seeming to spiral upward Like a contained
aurora as the Carousel picks up speed.
45		LOGAN
Caught up in it Like the rest.
46		CAROUSEL
Beginning to blur with its own speed. Through the shifting,
spiraling curtain of light we see bodies moving in a kind of
weightlessness, always struggling to move higher.
Follow a shadowy form as it moves, twists through other writhing
shadows -- upward, upward. Suddenly the form is spread-eagled, and
in a moment it is sharply outlined against the swirling canopy and
then -- a searing flash. And it is gone.
SOUND: Crowd in a frenzy -- SCREAMING.
47		FULL ANGLE - THE BLEACHER CROWD - FAVORING LOGAN
Standing. SCREAMING their cheers as:
48		FULL SHOT - UP AT CAROUSEL
High, reaching downward out of the shadows beneath the dome,
fringing, intersecting rainbow bands appear, looping the swirling
upper Carousel like Saturn's rings. Now we see figures reaching
outward toward them...reaching and missing and falling -downward
against the curtain and the flash of extinction.

bleachers.
They make their way into the hall.
Logan takes out the small plastic box. We can tell from his face
that he is disappointed...until a faint BEEPING SOUND emanates from
the box.
Francis watches as Logan wheels in one direction... the beeping
stops. He turns in another direction... again, there is no beeping.
As Logan turns in a third direction...the BEEPING commences.
Logan and Francis move swiftly in that direction and the BEEPING
GROWS LOUDER...AND LOUDER...until Logan and Francis see:
59-
59X11	    WIDE ANGLE - A MAN
running.
CHASE: INTER CUT between Logan and Francis following the running man
in the great hall...empty. We can HEAR the CROWD SCREAMING in
Carousel offstage.
A. Logan and Francis separate...to encircle the running man.
B. The running man turns a corner and for a moment Logan cannot see
him.
C. As Logan turns the corner...Francis is on the other side and
FIRES at the running man...JUST MISSING HIM.
D.Francis winks at Logan as he pursues the running man up a ramp
and Logan gets it:  A little cat and mouse is in order.
(NOTE: THE CHASE WILL BE THE DIRECTOR'S OPTION.)
E. Logan FIRES... just missing the man...Francis FIRES again. . .
just missing, too.
F. The man is in a panic as he continues up the ramp...to various
levels and areas.
G. Both barrels (of Logan and Francis' respective guns) glow again
as they FIRE...with both just missing the running man once more.
H. The man's face is crazed...and sweating...the mouse is going
berserk as he has been chased to a high level.
I. He stands frozen, petrified, driven to the edge of a high balcony
by the shots--teetering now. He is in full sight of Logan, Francis
is across the hall.
J. The Runner¹s face. He looks at death twenty feet away--Logan
aims.
K. Francis, watching, smiling at the perfect moment.
L. Logan's face. A shadow of thought, a hesitation.
M. The Runner lunges. Logan fires, misses.
N. Francis fires a salvo, drives the Runner back to the rail where
he teeters again, throws his hands in front of his face and plunges.
The SCREAMING in Carousel reaches a peak.
59X12-
63X1		    OUT
63X2		WITH LOGAN
As he arrives at the dead body of the Runner, bends over him, turns
the man's left hand up. We see the flower crystal. Black.
Logan takes out his transceiver.
63X3		INSERT TRANSCEIVER
A man's face visible. Logan checks it against the face of the dead
man. They are not the same.
63X4		ANOTHER ANGLE
As Francis comes up, waits. Logan moves the transceiver to the dead
man's face, rests it on his forehead.
63X5		INSERT TRANSCEIVER READOUT:
The words appear: IDENT. AFFIRM....NEW YOU #483 ALTERATION
63X6		LOGAN
Scowls for a moment, then shrugs. He takes out a small flat pouch
and methodically strips from the body its few personal things,
stuffs them into the pouch. Then his eye is caught by the man's
right hand, clenched. Logan opens it. A metal ankh on a bit of
chain. It means nothing to Logan who stuffs it into the pouch and
closes it. Now again he fiddles with the transceiver, speaks into it
softly."|stage direction

hall, passing CAMERA
63X7		ANOTHER ANGLE
We see in the distance, a pair of Stickmen descending into the hall,
riding through the air on their odd vehicles, passing overhead then
descending. One hovers not far away as the other comes down, hangs a
few feet over the body.
63X8		1ST STICKMAN AND BODY
The driver makes sure he's in position, then presses a button on one
of the arms of the vehicle. There is a broad spray of vapor from the
bottom which covers the corpse.
63X9		CORPSE (INSERT)
It turns to crystals which sag away from the human form, as a sand
sculpture erodes when it's dry.
63X10		1ST STICKMAN CLOSE ON HEAP OF CRYSTALS
Satisfied, he revs his machine and it rises smoothly out of the
SHOT. As it leaves, the second machine moves down and into its
place.

Glances at the crystals, maneuvers into position, presses his
buttons.
63X12		CLOSER ANGLE - THE CRYSTALS, STICKMAN
Sucked up into the machine as it hovers. As the floor is once again
bare, the 2nd Stickman revs slightly and his machine pulls up and
away.

As the Stickmen move up and out, we see the exhilarated crowd
beginning to pour out of Carousel.

63X16		POV - HALLUCIMILL EXT.
Crazy, man.
63X17		BACK TO LOGAN
Hesitates, as a COUPLE push past him gleefully on their way. He
looks and we see:
63X18		POV - ARCADE, UPPER LEVELS
The people from Carousel starting to pour in, loud, happy, ready for
more fun.
63X19		LOGAN
Not with it. He turns and starts making his way downwards towards
the exit.
63X20		LOGAN'S APARTMENT
As he enters. Idle, restless. He crosses to a sideboard--makes
himself a drink, sips, doesn't like it. Gets rid of it, makes
another. He fiddles with things, a game--sits, gets up. Now he is
beginning to feel the drink. Takes another belt, smiles. Now he goes
over to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials.
63X21		AT THE WALL RECESS
As Logan dials, blurred and smoky images appear in the recess--a
slow protoplasmic eddying in many colors. He tunes it in and the
figure of a smiling young man appears--bejeweled, lustrous, willing.
63X22		LOGAN AT THE CONSOLE
Bored as Mastroianni turns the dial again and the young man
dissolves. He dials again and now a beautiful young woman takes
shape. It is Jessica.
63X23		JESSICA AND LOGAN
Still in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile.
Around her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh. It catches Logan's
eye. He smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real. He reaches
out a hand and leads her out into the room.
64		LOGAN AND JESSICA
As Jessica turns to him, Logan moves in strongly and embraces her-
but, to his surprise, she resists. Logan, still holding her loosely,
is amused and surprised."|stage direction

Each LIFECLOCK pulses out the moments of every person alive in the

the next LIFECLOCK when the time comes.
There are no humans.
Francis walks over to a circular table at the end of the room....
above which is a circular overhang. There is a groove...the shape of
a palm crystal on one part of the circular table.
Francis takes out the plastic bag which contains the contents of the
dead Runner's pockets and starts putting the contents on the table.
(These contents are the ones from the Runner Francis has killed at
the beginning of the film.)
The moment the first item touches the table...it activates a scanner

Aesculaptor Mark III -- the latest in servo-surgical designs.
Completely self-contained -- tilt-bed, cryojector services embedded
in the platform. The Mark III's laser heads are integrated into the
whole cocoon, swiveled and gimbaled so as to be able to focus any of
the surgical beams in microscopic delicacy or wide-bladed scraping.
The machine vaguely resembles an enormously complicated x-ray table
on an angle -- the great slotted laser heads overhanging it and
Integral with it. From the cryonic receptor base there is a steady
exhalation of cold -- the vapor seeping steadily downwards, blurring
the endlessly looped and tangled tubes and wires and containers
Which join in solid state circuitry so that any random or
involuntary twitch of a patient will be instantly compensated by an
equivalent move of the laser head -- keeping the focus precise.

demonstrating, Doc goes to the console and flips switches. Instantly
the table responds -- the platform tilting, the crab-like laser arms
descending flexing -- small vapor jets oozing as the beams slash
harmlessly across the table. Beaming, Doc turns it off and the whole

As the SOUND, etcetera, repeat-s once more...Logan pushes the ankh

center becomes brighter as the door opens.
There is a hesitation...in which Logan turning his head back...
realizes what he has done and is shaken.

217		ON THE OTHER SIDE
now, they can still hear the SOUND, etcetera for the last time.
Beyond the lock is the ruins of a vast undersea complex in which
food was raised and harvested. What we see is an endless shadowy
labyrinth of breeding pens which stretch off into the green darkness
-- a kind of mammoth aquarium with catwalks and ramps intersecting
the huge tanks. The levels are multiple and everything is slimed,
rusted, rotted and wet.
In the tanks themselves are shoals of fish, gardens of seaweed, etc.
The machinery for harvesting and winnowing has long since gone to
rust -- and visible in the great tanks are the wrecks of vessels and
gear -- the kind of stuff Cousteau and Co. are using now.
Footing is dangerous -- a slip from any catwalk means a plunge into
water and some of the walkways are well under water anyhow. From an
invisible ceiling comes a steady dripping and everything is crusted
and smells of salt and decay and life in the darkness.
217X1	WITH FRANCIS
As he arrives at the door, the ankh glowing as before.
But Francis has a light. He examines the door with it, and as it
lights the pool of water on the ground, it picks out Jessica's ankh.
FRANCIS stoops, gets it and looks from it to the one glowing

Bewildered -- uncertain, as their eyes adjust to the dim light.
Finally, Logan gestures ''this way"" and sets out.

through a labyrinth. They go along, gripping a rail where possible,
sometimes sinking deep into water, sometimes rising above it. They
run into blind endings and retrace to the last junction -- always
trying for what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along the
great wall...)

opens into a kind of glistening darkness, suffused by a bluish glow.
It is now very cold.
In the silence Logan stirs. Groping, he touches Jessica, who moves
close to him. Logan puts his arm around her and they rise. Slowly,
tentatively, he leads her out into the dark chamber where they stand
