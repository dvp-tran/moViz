She cooks for one. Does everything for one. She opens the

Rey OPENS THE BOX and sees inside Luke Skywalker's original
lightsaber. With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but
she cannot resist. As her hand makes contact with it, there

SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible
FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS
BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER!
Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE
GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND HITS KYLO REN SQUARE IN THE HEAD AND
CHEST. HE GOES DOWN, SUDDENLY A FEARFUL MAN, A LARGE BURN
SCAR SLASHED ACROSS HIS FACE! He still reaches for his saber.
And she could kill him -- right now, with ONE VICIOUS STRIKE!
But she stops. Realizing she stands on a greater edge than
even the cliff -- the edge of the dark side. The earth
SHAKES. The earth splits. A gully forms."|stage direction

Rey stares, knowing exactly who it is. But she just stares
for what seems like forever. Until he finally TURNS, SLOWLY,
to her. Pulls back his hood.
IT IS LUKE SKYWALKER.
Older now, white hair, bearded. He looks at Rey. A kindness
in his eyes, but there's something tortured, too. He doesn't
need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here. His
look says it all.
In response, Rey pulls something from the pack.
LUKE'S LIGHTSABER.
And she holds it out to him. An offer. A plea. The galaxy's
only hope.
HOLD ON LUKE SKYWALKER'S INCREDIBLE FACE, amazed and
conflicted at what he sees, as our MUSIC BUILDS, the promise
of an adventure, just beginning..."|stage direction
