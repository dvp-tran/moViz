The sedan launches down the alley.
Utah running.  Like a freight train.  Splashing through a

shoulder into a large, steel GARBAGE DUMPSTER.
DRIVING it like a football training sled into the ALLEY

UTAH hurtles from the alley.  He leaps, somehow TACKLES
the DRIVER'S door handle and is dragged along the street.
He pulls himself up, reaches inside the window, and whips
the steering wheel hard right.
The SEDAN fishtails into a parked Toyota.  Utah bounces
forward, slamming into the asphalt.  Glass shards and
crushed steel are strewn everywhere, as radiator steam
whistles hot.
Pig Nose #2, riding shotgun, is trapped.  Can't get his
crushed door open.  The DRIVER pushes open her door.
Gropes for her pistol.  Utah springs -- no respect for a
lady.  He slams the door, pins her arm and slams again and
again until the gun drops.  Utah kicks it away as the
woman collapses in pain.
Pig Nose #1 bails out and runs across parking lot.  Utah
leaps up onto the crushed hood and draws down with the
shotgun."|stage direction

Pig Nose's flak vest lights up like a pinball machine.
Utah's laser weapon hit the ""kill zone"".  Pig Nose rips
the tape off his face and the FBI CADET shakes his head in
disgust.
OBSERVERS step forward.  Bank customers.  Bank tellers.
All FBI personnel.  MEDICAL STAFF offer the woman driver
assistance.  Pig Nose #1 heads for Johnny, but is subdued
by other agents."|stage direction

Roach's finger relaxes on the trigger.
Utah puts his hand on Angelo's white crewcut hair.
He hears the scraping of steel on asphalt behind him as
Bodhi picks up the other twelve gauge.
Roach is working himself to his knees.  His breath is
sucking through a bloody hole in his chest as well as the

helps him up.  He covers Utah with the shot gun as he
half-carries Roach to the plane.  The pilot is white with
