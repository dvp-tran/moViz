Written by

From the novel by
Walter Mosley
March 9, 1994 - 3rd Draft
1   INT. CHAMPION AIRCRAFT - BENNY GIACOMO'S OFFICE                1
A battered wooden desk drawer groans open and light brown
skinned hands with dirty fingernails twist the cap off a
pint of rye whiskey and pour liquor into a coffee cup.
O.S. VOICE
You know, when you fire somebody
you have to stick to your guns.
They screw the cap back on and lay the bottle in the drawer.
O.S. VOICE
(continuing)
The men might get to thinkin' that
I'm weak if I take you back.
The cup rises to the face of BENNY GIACOMO, late forties,
with salt and pepper hair that was once jet black. Skin
darker than a Louisiana Creole.
He takes a sip and bares his teeth in a grimace from the
whiskey. As he talks we gradually see more of him -- feet
kicked up on the desk, fully in charge.
A Betty Grable like pin-up girl is giving us background in
more ways than one in a swimsuit and high heels on a
calendar tacked to the wall: May, 1948.
BENNY
(continuing)
And I didn't tell Dupree that I'd
give you your job back... All I
said was that I'd be glad to talk
to you if you said the right
thing... Do you have something to
say?
A stream of cigarette smoke snakes through as the back of a
man's head and shoulder nudges in and shifts nervously.
MAN
Mr. Giacomo, when one of the white
guys has come off a double shift
and says he's too tired to work
overtime, you don't fire him.
BENNY
Fella, what'd I tell ya? If you're
not willing to give a little extra,
Champion can't use you.
EASY RAWLINS, thirty, handsome and a much darker brown than
Giacomo, takes a drag off a Chesterfield cigarette.

Through the window behind him, a team of men pour over a
partly assembled airplane, their voices echoing in the
hangar that surrounds the office.
Benny measures out his words one at a time.
BENNY (O.S.)
Now... Do... you... have...
something... to say?
Easy swallows his frustration in silence and thinks about
swallowing his pride as well. And then:
EASY
I want my job back, Mr. Giacomo. I
need to work and I need a good job.
BENNY (O.S.)
Is that all?
Easy looks down into the smoke and sits up straight to keep
from bowing his head.
EASY
No, that's not all... I need money
so that I can pay my mortgage and
eat... I need a house to live in
and a place to raise children... I
need to buy clothes so I can--
BENNY
I'm sorry, fella, but I gotta get
back to work...
And he swings his feet down and stands up to go.   But Easy
is up too, blocking his way out the door.
EASY
Ezekiel, Mr. Giacomo.
BENNY
Hunh?
EASY
My name is Ezekiel... Ezekiel
Rawlins.
Benny clinches his fists and focuses on Easy's chest like a
fighter. And Easy rocks back on one foot ready to score a
field goal with his right knee.
Slowly, Giacomo's face creases into a plastic grin and he
shrugs.

BENNY
S'cuse me, Ezekiel.
And he walks around Easy, shaking his head as if amused.
Easy watches him go as the low moan of the baritone sax from
Duke Ellington's ""Absinthe"" snakes up like sin and we
2   FADE TO BLACK                                                    2
And watch the titles, the last one reading ""Two Weeks
Later""...
FADE IN:
3   EXT. JOPPY'S BAR - DAY                                           3
Black and grey cars, Packards and Buicks from 1928 to 1948,
come and go on Central Avenue. Two-storied storefronts with
canvas awnings, above black men and women in hats... all in
a hurry.
The Red Car rumbles through and then a white Cadillac
convertible pulls to the curb in front of a butcher shop.
Above the shop on the next floor are large partly open
windows with JOPPY'S BAR in boldface letters. Inside sits
Easy, back to the window reading the classified ads.
4   INT. JOPPY'S BAR                                                 4
T-Bone Walker's ""Westside Baby"" plays on the jukebox as Easy
takes a final drag off his cigarette and stubs it out.
THE FRONT PAGE of the LOS ANGELES TIMES lies face up on the
table beneath the ashtray displaying A PHOTOGRAPH of a
middle-aged white man and his pretty young woman companion
smiling and waving.
Above the happy couple is a headline ""CARTER DROPS OUT OF
RACE""... The caption under the photo reads ""Wealthy civic
leader, Todd Carter, shown here with his lovely bride-to-be,
Daphne Monet, at a fundraiser last month was unavailable for
comment on his surprising withdrawal from the Mayor's race.""
O.S. VOICE
Catch ya later, Joppy.
BACK TO SCENE
SPLACK! An older black man hitching up his pants underneath
a bloodstained butcher's apron has slapped his empty beer
glass down hard on the counter on his way out.

JOPPY
Hey, watch the marble!   Dammit,
what'd I tell you?
The fifty-year-old burly bartender leans over his big
stomach checking for cracks and buffing the veiny marble top
of the bar with a filthy rag. Behind him is a yellow
billboard from 1932 with big black letters reading ""Fuller
vs. Shag. 10 ROUND MAIN EVENT."" We could make out more of
the poster and the eight-by-ten framed boxing photos around
it if it wasn't so smoky in the place.
EASY
Joppy, how much they payin' out
there at McDonell Douglas?"|unknown||
1||"I don't know.   Don't it say--
His words hang as his eyes stray toward the door.
Easy looks up also at
THE DOORWAY which fills with the large frame of the white
MAN in an off-white linen suit, his pale eyes surveying the
room. Satisfied that all but two of the six tables in the
tiny room are unoccupied, he smiles at Joppy and walks to
the far end of the bar.
Easy is surprised to see Joppy, tough ex-heavyweight that he
is, duck his head and smile as he makes his way over like
he's answering a summons. The white man extends a friendly
hand and the two of them shake like old friends and lean in
close to talk in private.
Easy finds it hard not to watch their conversation as he
takes a sip from a short glass of bourbon on the rocks.
After a moment...
JOPPY
Easy, come on over here. This
here's somebody I want ya to
meet... Come on. This here's a
friend of mine.
Easy drains his glass and stands up, then walks over."|unknown||
2||"Yeah, Easy.   This here's Mr.
Albright.
ALBRIGHT
You can call me Dewitt, Easy.
5.

He extends his hand and Easy shakes it.
EASY
How ya doin'?
JOPPY
(bowing and grinning)
Mr. Albright and me goes back to
before the war when I was still in
the fight game.
ALBRIGHT
(to Easy)
Ever seen this guy fight...? Any
time Joppy Shag stepped in the ring
you knew you were gonna see some
real knock-down-drag-out-
fisticuffs... Where you from, Easy?
EASY
(awkwardly)
Houston.
ALBRIGHT
Houston... Joppy's hometown.
Joppy pours Albright a straight shot of Wild Turkey and the
big man sips it.
ALBRIGHT
So I hear you need a job.
Easy throws a look at Joppy, but Joppy is busy buffing the
bar and putting more of Easy's business in the street.
JOPPY
Aw yeah, Easy always tryin' to do
better. Got his high school
certificate from night school.
He's threatenin' up on some
college. And he's one of the few
colored men around here who owns
his own house. Shoot, he pays a
mortgage every month just like a
white man.
ALBRIGHT
Property owner, hunh?
He turns up his drink and sets the empty glass down on the
counter.

ALBRIGHT
(continuing)
These big companies, don't give a
damn, do they?
He reaches in his coat pocket and produces a business card
and scribbles something on it.
ALBRIGHT
(continuing)
If you need a job, drop by this
address at seven tonight.
Easy takes the card and glances at it.
EASY
What kind of work you do?
ALBRIGHT
I do favors... I do favors for
friends. Drop by.
He nods to Joppy and walks out the door.
EASY
Who the hell is that, Joppy?
JOPPY
Just somebody I know... A bidness
man.
EASY
What kinda business?
JOPPY
Oh, I don't ask him all that. He
comes in here every so often
looking for somebody to do a little
job for him... He pays good.
EASY
In other words, he's a gangster.
JOPPY
I didn't say that... But if there's
a dollar laying in the street I
don't think he'll let a little dirt
stop him from picking it up. If
you worried about making that house
note this month, maybe you wanna
pay him a call. All them pretty
girls you be with ain't gonna buy
you a house.

Easy cocks his head ""Are you crazy?""
JOPPY
(continuing)
Sound like he just wants you to
keep your eyes open for somebody...
He'll pay you whether you see
anything or not... If it was me I'd
take that man's money and go on
about my bidness... Ain't nothin'
to worry about.
Easy is still suspicious, but can't take his eyes off the
card.
EASY (V.O.)
When somebody tells me ""Don't
worry,"" I usually look down to see
if my fly is open... I noticed
Albright didn't bother to pay for
his drink.
5   EXT. EASY'S '46 PONTIAC - DAY                                    5
Little single family houses with tiny yards of St. Augustine
grass rush toward the amber Indianhead hood ornament on
Easy's car.

Duke Ellington's ""Mood Indigo"" plays on the radio as Easy
heads for home in thought."|unknown||
3||"(continuing)
DeWitt Albright reminded me of
somebody I knew back in Houston.
His name was Raymond Alexander but
we called him Mouse... Mouse called
hisself a businessman too. And I
found out that I shouldn't be
nowhere around when Mouse got down
to his business... I learned that
the hard way.
A neighbor sweeps out her front porch and waves at Easy as
he slows down in front of his house.
7   EXT. EASY'S HOUSE - DAY                                          7
He gets out of his car and a group of children chasing a man
giving goat cart rides, washes past him in the street.

A crowd has gathered along the street to watch a three
convertible car caravan: the first car bearing a four-place
band playing ""Happy Days Are Here Again""; the second with
someone who could be Lana Turner holding up a ""Teran for

announcing through a megaphone; and last, but hardly least,
Matthew Teran blowing kisses and waving two small American
flags.
Easy looks up for a moment as he closes the trunk of his car
to watch the parade. Then stuffs a ball peen hammer in the
waistband at the small of his back, under his jacket.
He walks with a purpose into the open door next to the
butcher shop.

window with the gun and the shade rattles all the way up.
Manny looks right up at his face as Daphne arches and
flails, trying to get free from his hands that are pinning
her down on a battered old sofa.
Albright is holding a glowing red poker that Shariff,
standing in front of the fireplace, has just handed him.
Easy starts blasting.   KABLAAM!   Manny takes one to the
throat. KABLAAM!
Albright and Shariff lunge for cover, and Daphne ducks down
behind the back of the sofa, screaming and screaming.
Manny, hand to his throat, pulls his gun on reflex, firing
into the floor and then half runs, half staggers out the
side door just ahead of another KABLAAM! that digs out a
chunk of the wall.
Easy hears the screen door open and then ducks down, getting
ready for Manny who should be coming his way from the side
door. He HEARS more steps stumble out and then... SILENCE.
And then, KABLAAM! BLAAM! Two huge blasts rip right
through the wall next to Easy's head, and he scrambles to
the side of the house, underneath another window with the
shade pulled down.

But it's Manny, clutching his throat, gurgling for air,
stumbling aimlessly off down the hill. A walking dead
man... EASY hears him tumble into some shrubbery and after a
moment the gurgling stops.

with the gun but KABLAAM! BLAAM! BLAAM! The windowsill
tears out above his head and Daphne screams again.
Easy looks up to see Shariff, holding her in front of him as
a shield. He's headed straight for Easy, drawing a bead on
him for the kill. And then KABLAAM! the back of Shariff's
skull flies off and
MOUSE is in the side door, blasting.     BLAAM!
Albright breaks for the window. BLAAM! The slug spins him
halfway around but he hurls himself through the window
backwards.
Easy scurries to the front of the house and BLAAM! The
bullet goes wide and Albright manages to get into his car
and returns fire. BLAAM! BLAAM!... Easy hits the deck.
Albright's engine roars to life and he SQUEALS out on the
gravel. Mouse appears on the other side of the house and
CLICK! CLICK! he's out of ammo. He pulls out the other
pistol, but it's too late.

foolin' 'round with him?
EASY
He was tied up! Why?!
MOUSE
Aw, man. If you didn't want him
kilt you shouldn't have left him
with me.
And he goes around to the passenger side of the car to get
in.
Unlike up at the house this was murder -- the same as it had
been in Texas with Mouse's stepfather and brother. Tears of
rage well up in Easy's eyes as he hears the car door close.

them.
EASY (V.O.)
I convinced Mouse to take the two
o'clock train to Pomona and to let
me handle everything else. He
could get a train back to Houston
later that morning... He was fine
with that but only because he was
seven thousand dollars richer.
Daphne had gotten the money out of
a locker at the YMCA without a
word...
