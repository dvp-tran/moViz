A New York Times crossword puzzle. The hand of MARY HOROWITZ
scratches the answers in ink without pausing even a second
between each one.
MARY (V.O.)
Vita aenigma est. Life is a
puzzle. It is. Specifically, life
is most like a crossword puzzle.
There are a million reasons why,
not the least of which is that
life, like crosswords, requires the
use of your whole entire brain-
Her writing hand knocks a glass of grape soda and it spills
all over the puzzle."|speech

The puzzle answers all run together."|speech
3||INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY|location

except for one.
In the last chair sits Mary Horowitz, 31, in her best
synthetic cardigan, somebody's grandmother's skirt, her own
red rubber boots. Genius meets retard. She mumbles to
herself."|speech
5|MARY|"Four letter word for... vomit.
She takes a deep breath to calm her nerves. it doesn't help."|speech
6|MARY|"Not ""barf"". For sure not ""barf"".
That's too easy. ""Puke"" is okay,
but maybe a bit pedestrian (that
means boring)... I like ""hurl"". I
do. I like the way it rolls off
your tongue -- the word, I mean.
But my all time favorite is none of
those.
She puts her head between her knees, tries to keep it
together.

W. Spew... Sp-ew.
A door nearby opens but Mary doesn't budge. A POLICE OFFICER
walks out.

The Teacher reads from her notes."|speech
12|TEACHER|"Here's a treat, students. Our
final guest for Career Day, Miss
Mary Horowitz, is the crossword
constructor for the Atlanta

them. Isn't that fun?
Mary stares at the Teacher, whispers."|speech

time but they don't often think of
the person who made all the words
fit together, and who thought up
the clues, and who made sure the
little black squares at the top
mirror the ones at the bottom.
She pulls one of the crosswords out of the garbage can, holds
it up, turns it upside down, forces a nervous smile."|speech
24|MARY|"Crossword constructors usually have
above average intelligence, with
knowledge of just about every
subject you can imagine. And it
helps if they can spell.
The card in Mary's hand reads ""LAUGH"". She laughs. Nobody
else does. She looks at the cards again, instantly gets
serious, sweeps her hand through the air."|speech

Mary notices one Kid with his hand up. It totally throws her
off."|speech

hyperventilating."|speech

Mary grasps for breath, struggles to speak."|speech

33|TEACHER|"Water. Just hang on.
The Teacher rushes out. The kids all stare at Mary."|speech
34|MARY|"Yep, I live at home...
She forces herself to get it together, totally faking it."|speech
35|MARY|"But so do all of you, so there...
And sure, I only create one
crossword puzzle a week but I have
deadlines, I have stress, I have
demands on me so huge you would not
believe. The newspaper business is
hell. I mean it. Hell.
Somebody's got to write about all
the horrors that go on in this
world."|speech

MARY (cont'd)
And after people read about those
horrors, somebody else has to bring
them back from the brink of
suicide. Who do you think that is?
She leans in close to the front row, scares herself more than
anybody."|speech
37|MARY|"Me! My crossword puzzle is always
good news. it enlightens.
it r andma's
entertains. It keeps your g
mind alive so she remembers to send
you five bucks on your birthday.
Think about that as you lie in bed
tonight picking your nose and crying
yourself to sleep. I know I will.
The Kids just stare at her. She leans against the teacher's
desk, tries to look relaxed but fails miserably."|speech
38|MARY|"My job matters, you know. In media
circles I am, as the Dutch say,
geliefd. That means I have plenty
of friends. Hoards, in fact.
Scads even.
The kids aren't buying it.
LARGE KID
You're a freak.
The kids all nod in agreement. Mary's frozen, devastated.
The Teacher rushes back into the room with a cup of water,
hands it over. Mary sips it like communion wine. Half of it
runs down her chin.
Mary looks at the Teacher, fakes a smile."|speech

She smiles at an angry ELDERLY LADY sitting across from her.
The lady gives her the ""don't talk to me"" glare, then stares
out the window. Mary fidgets in her seat.

MARY (V.O.)
In crosswords, as in life, some
days are harder than others. It's
true. In the New York Times, for
example, the puzzles get harder as
the week goes. So on Monday, a day
that traditionally bites the big
one, the crossword is super easy.
It's comforting to know that
although life can be difficult at
times, crosswords let you off easy
when you need it the most.

As she takes her time paying, Mr. Takihashi madly gestures

Betty takes Mary's money, waves her on and helps the next
customer."|speech
61|MARY|"So no then? That's a no?
Betty ignores her. Mary waits, loads the newspapers into her
bag.
MARY (V.O.)
Sometimes crosswords are even
better than life. Here's how.
They don't discriminate.
Crosswords don't care if you're
young or old; black or white; male,
female or intersex. Crosswords
only care if you're an idiot. And,
really, that's okay, because if you
have the IQ of a yam, finishing a
crossword should be the least of
your worries.

million Stevens with a V in the
country, you know. It's much more
popular than the P-H way, almost
twice as popular in fact. I think
it's the Brits who prefer the P-H.
They love their P-H's over there.
Not as much as they love their fish
and chips but still, they love
them. It was the media thing, you
know, that's why our moms wanted us
to get together. You work in the
media, so do I. We really have to
hand it to our moms, Steve, we do,
and not just for raising us, or for
thriving during a time when women
painstakingly struggled for
equality, but I mean we should hand
it to them for being visionaries
and predicting our all encompassing
compatibility. We're
professionally compatible, yes, but
it's occurring to me at this
particular moment that we're also
sexually compatible, and I don't
know if you noticed like I noticed
but we're also both wearing blue.
What are the chances of that?
Actually, if I really think about
it, the chances are probably pretty
good. Blue is one of the most
popular three colors, however,
yours is-

She grabs her own tag and reads it, just about elbowing Steve

fibres! And the chances of that
are much smaller than the chances
of us just wearing blue.
Steve looks at Mary - suddenly fully aware of her craziness.

She just about jumps out of her pants with excitement."|speech

of the meaning of words? You love
words, right?"|speech

She can hardly believe her good fortune. Her mind reels just
as fast as her lips."|speech

KOCO REPORTER
Eleven months ago, the child we've
come to know as Baby Peggy was born
with an extremely rare birth
defect, a third leg. Shortly after
the birth, her parents Misty and
Bill Dunlevy separated. Now with
joint custody, one parent wants the
baby to keep the third leg, the
other wants it gone...
A few feet away, a female FOX NEWS REPORTER is on camera.
FOX NEWS REPORTER
After months of legal wrangling, a
judge has ordered in favor of the
mother. Amputation surgery is
scheduled for Wednesday but the
father, Bill Dunlevy, isn't about
to give up. As his lawyers work to
secure an injunction, the devoted
father rallies public support for
the extra limb.

sorry assortment of oddballs standing at the fence, waving
their signs: ""SPARE THE LEG"", and ""HONOR THE FATHER"". Many
of them carry drawings of a three legged baby wearing a halo.
Steve braces himself and heads for the crowd. Half way
across, he spots a loner walking from the parking lot. He's
35, chubby, his shirt buttoned one button off so it hangs
lower on the left. This is HOWARD. In one hand: a pro-leg

holds.
