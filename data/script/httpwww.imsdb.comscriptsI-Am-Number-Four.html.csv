space. A TEEN BOY sleeps in one and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN lies
in the other. Their ebony skin glistens in the swampy heat.
The numbing THROB OF INSECTS fills the silence until
THE DOOR SOFTLY RATTLES.
The Teen's eyes fly open. Fear grips his face as he looks
over at the Man, who is now upright and awake. They hold
their breath, listening over the DRUMMING CHORUS.
ANOTHER RATTLE.
It's louder this time. Unmistakable. The Teen watches as
the Man pulls a crystal-handled dagger from under his pillow
and stealthily creeps to the door. The Man cautiously leans
in and peers through the bamboo slats.
WHAT HE SEES: The empty porch. No sign of life.
Relieved, he turns back, opens his mouth to speak when his
face contorts. He looks down and sees the tip of
A SERRATED METAL BLADE
protruding from his chest. As the sword is viciously
protracted through the door, the Man meets the Teen's haunted
eyes and whispers his last, desperate word..."|speech

through the maze of trees. Flecks of moonlight ricochet off
the crystal pendant that dangles around his neck. He moves
impossibly fast. Faster than any human could.
A MONSTROUS HOWL
ECHOES as something otherworldly catches his scent and begins
thrashing in pursuit. The Teen's face tightens with dread
and the SHOUTS of his pursuers hammer his ears.
He doesn't look back, willing himself to survive. He races
up a verge and fearlessly launches himself off the edge of
A 100-FOOT-WIDE RAVINE!
GOD SHOT LOOKING DOWN as the Teen leaps across the abyss. He
kicks air as he arcs and finally touches down on the opposite
lip. Chest heaving, he sees the hideous silhouette of
A HULKING BEAST.
It's called a Piken and skitters to a stop on the other side.
It utters a chilling BANSHEE WAIL of frustration. Relieved,
the Teen turns to make his escape when"|speech
13|A HAND|"wraps around his throat. He is effortlessly hoisted by a
TOWERING MAN with skin as cold and pale as alabaster.
THIS IS A MOGADORIAN.
He wears the long red coat of a Commander. We catch the
briefest glimpse of his cruel magenta eyes as they scan the
geometric symbol engraved on the Teen's pendant. Silhouetted
against the giant jungle moon, he triumphantly raises
A SWORD.
Its serrated blade ignites with silver flame as it sweeps
towards the Teen. The boy's DEATH CRY echoes as the CAMERA
ZEROES IN ON the pendant that glows brilliant-bright.

The trio crisscrosses the turquoise sea while a party rages

Daniel makes a kamikaze move, whips his jet ski past his
opponents and victoriously pumps his fist. But his moment of
triumph is cut short. His face contorts in agony as he feels"|speech

Henri's eyes narrow with urgency. He is immediately on his
feet, he kneels at Daniel's side and studies the symbol on
the teen's ankle. It has stopped glowing but is painfully

JOHN (O.S.)
Mark! Linoleum! Now!
Mark rips free and hits the deck a second before the trophy
case EXPLODES. Shards of glass rip into the Mogadorians and
trophies torpedo off the shelves and impale the aliens
against the far wall. The Mogadorians SCREAM as they flail.
John, Sarah and Six break cover. John wrenches Mark to his
feet and they take off running. They dash around the next
corner and find

He watches as the beagle sprints forward and launches himself
at the monster. Bernie clamps onto the Piken's neck. He's
hopelessly outmatched and holds on for dear life as the Piken
tries to buck him off. Then something amazing happens --
BERNIE BEGINS TO MORPH.
He doubles, triples in size and keeps growing. His features
become reptilian, gecko-like, his fur turns to spines and in

fling cabinets, doors, benches anything he can to block the
fiery onslaught. But the rounds are coming too fast and a

napalm. As FLAMES wash across him, he looks up and snaps on

Oddly, Six doesn't move. She closes her eyes and lays one
hand on the flooded floor, turning the water to

The Piken prowls behind the serving counter. Snow beads off
its back. Its monstrous nostrils suddenly flare, sensing
something. It hunches lower and peers at the trays and pans
that are stored below.
REVEAL JOHN AND SIX. They're invisible. John clutches Six's
arm. They're lying between a stack of roasting dishes.
