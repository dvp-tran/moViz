Hi. Sorry to call out of the blue but
I have a, well, a publishing question
and I thought you might be the person
to ask, I have this manuscript,
something to do with my professional
experiences, not to go into too much
detail but I think it's pretty
explosive stuff and I think that it
could merit a fairly wide readership
handled properly and it isn't quite
finished yet but there's a situation
where I'm worried about it leaking now
and maybe excerpts being published or
on the internet, whatever, without my
permission, and a lot of the impact
being, um, blunted, so I'm actually
anxious to bring it to market sooner
than I'd planned----I mean, like now, in
fact----so I was thinking, I know you,
and you seem to do well, so I was
wondering if you were happy with your
publisher. The people you use.

He yanks his hand back and shakes it.      He looks at the ball
of his thumb. He sucks it.
He carefully picks a brooch out of the jewelry case and
flings it across the room.
He resumes dumping jewelry into his box.
He suddenly stops:
A faint knock.    The front door.
Osbourne waits.
The knock repeats.
113.
Another beat.
The front door creaks open.
Osbourne carefully sets down his drink. He steps quietly to
the closet and pulls a small cedar chest off a high shelf."|unknown

1583||"Linda flings open the door to her car parked on the street
bordering the mall. She gets in and turns the ignition.
Pulling into traffic she checks her rear-view, and her look
snags on:
A dark four-door sedan pulling out a few cars back. It falls
in behind her. Its driver is a man in sunglasses. He
reaches up and touches fingertips to one ear.
Linda frowns.   She looks forward, glances again at the
mirror.
Another dark car pulls into the lane next to the first.    Its
driver is also a man in sunglasses."|unknown

living room, a handgun at the ready. His drink is in his
other hand. Ice cubes clink as he moves.
The living room is empty.
Osbourne advances cautiously.     A quick sidelong look at the
kitchen.
Empty.
He proceeds to the basement door."|unknown

She gives worried glances at her rear-view.
The light ahead turns yellow, red.
Cars ahead stop.   Linda stops.
A rhythmic thudding sound.    It almost makes her car vibrate.
114.
She looks around.   She rolls down her window, sticks her head
out, looks up.
A black helicopter hovers overhead, rotors thudding. A black-
clad body leans partway out. The person seems to be looking
down.
Linda draws her head back in.
LINDA
Oh for Pete's sake."|unknown

either hand, gun up, ice cubes clinking.
The basement comes slowly into view.
Someone stands behind his desk, at the computer.
Osbourne descends further. He stops on the bottom step and
stares at Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of Hardbodies.
Ted stares at him.
A long silence between the two men.
Then, quietly:
OSBOURNE
And you are... my wife's lover.
TED
No.
OSBOURNE
Then what are you doing here.
Silence.
Osbourne takes the last step down.    He advances slowly, gun
trained on Ted.
Osbourne's look, holding on Ted, changes.
OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
... I know you. You're the guy at the
gym.
Ted licks his lips.
TED
I'm not here representing Hardbodies.

She's not----

No.

Yes. You're one of the morons I've
