BEDROOM
A WOMAN sleeps on the bed, curled up around a bundled BABY.
Is this the final, peaceful memory of a drowning man?
Something's wrong, then: the woman's body in an unnatural
position, more thrown than laid across the bed. The crib
tipped over, blankets scattered. Her eyes frozen open.
Something BLACK flutters against the window pane, CRACKING
into the glass. The sound of the BLIZZARD creeps in...
RESUME - HUDSON RIVER
Wind POUNDS the river where Max had once been, but there's no

a bench. A squeaking TURNSTILE catches their ear...
The same boots grind towards the Men. We don't see the
walker's face, distracted by something else: a gleaming gold
wristwatch. As if to make certain the Men notice, he pulls
back his sleeve to check the time. Quarter past three...
The watch glints as it passes into a dark doorway marked
`MEN'S.' The Men follow, exchanging wicked grins. Too easy.
SUBWAY BATHROOM
The Men slink into the bathroom, smirking at their oblivious
prey at the sink. Steam rising, he sets the watch on the

Max Payne, but not yet the man struggling for life in the
river: clean-shaven, skin like bleached bone. Haunted eyes.
In the murky mirror, Max sees the Men circling closer..."|stage direction

the sink. It hits the dirty tile, delicate crystal CRACKING.
In a sudden blur of movement, Max has one hand on the pistol,
the other one SMASHING into Pawnshop's windpipe...
Doug steps forward to help... BOOM! The pistol goes off as
Max pries it free. Max looks up at Doug. Nowhere to run, he
races into the farthest stall and SLAMS the door.
In the same instant, the Kid bolts for the door. Max has to
pick: follow or stay with the man he's tracking...
In the stall, Doug crawls on his stomach across the sticky
floor, trying to squeeze under the divider. Max raises the
pistol and BLASTS a hole through the door of the next stall."|stage direction

No, he got shot robbing a liquor store.
What are you talking about?
DOUG

Their wings are golden, the feathers only

slamming into the wall as he cuffs his hands behind his back.
PLATFORM
Max stalks out of the bathroom, pushing Doug ahead of him.
Down on the tracks, the Kid shrinks into the shadows...
SUBWAY TUNNEL
The Kid runs down the dark tracks, nervously glancing back at
the receding light of the platform.   He slows gradually,
relaxing as escape seems certain.
Down to a walk, he startles at movement in the tunnel ahead:
FLAPPING WINGS - a bird, lost and trapped underground?
The Kid freezes, his frightened BREATHS almost enough to
drown the sound out. It grows, though, more WINGS joining...
He turns to retreat up the tracks, but the WINGS suddenly
seem to be echoing towards him from all directions.
Panicked, the Kid becomes disoriented in the growing RACKET,
the tunnel ahead begins to glow brighter as he spins...
Visible now in the growing light, BLACK SHAPES flicker above
the tracks - dozens becoming hundreds, swelling larger, their
POUNDING wings joined by a train RUMBLING closer..."|stage direction

GREAT HALL

GUARDS appear at the other end of the hallway, OPENING UP.
Their SHOTS echo, the great room ringing like a cave.
Max lifts his eyes - what had been four stories now seems
like forty, the top not visible behind hazy black smoke.
Bullets WHISTLE past Max's ear. Distracted, he RETURNS FIRE,

WINGED CREATURES drifting down from above, circling closer...
Max stumbles, buffeted by their POUNDING WINGS. CHOKING on
sulfurous smoke, hair smoldering, skin starting to singe...
ANOTHER HALLWAY
A small group of Guards race forward, dodging the bodies of
others Max met along the way. They hesitate, form ranks...
GREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS
...and the frightened Guards charge into the great room.
It is silent. Smokeless. Just a hall. Blood streaks the
walls, flows between the crumpled carcasses of more dead
GUARDS. At the far end of the hall, something moves:
Max. On his hands and knees, rivers of sweat flowing.
Confused, the group of Guards approach Max. Weapons ready.
MAX'S HALLUCINATION
Crushed inside the DEAFENING blackness, Max lifts his eyes to
see LEERING DEMONS gazing down, distorted versions of...

logged body on the floor. He's MUTTERING, CHANTING...
So easy it almost doesn't seem fair, a Guard aims his pistol.
Suddenly, bullets RIP through the Guards from behind. No
chance to respond, bodies torn open with a merciless BLAST of
machine gun fire. They fall around Max, joining the rest.
Gun smoking, Mona rushes up the hallway to Max.
MAX'S HALLUCINATION
The Demons fade away, their howling SCREAMS lingering behind.
Awaiting the next horror, Max is shocked by something else:
White light splits open the smoke, cutting the black in two.
GREAT HALL
Mona kneels down over Max, lifting up his head. Max's skin
is pale, slick like melting wax. His eyes are empty.
