""JOYEUX NOEL GOTHAM -- Only 16 Shopping Days Left Till
Christmas.""
The streets are bustling with jolly shoppers.  At a souvenir
store, we find an exasperated MOM squabbling with her seven-
year old.  Like many other storefronts in Gotham, this one is
overflowing with bootleg BATMAN MERCHANDISE: t-shirts, key
chains, ceramic figurines.  The kid is already wearing a
Batman baseball cap and a little black cape, but he obviously
wants more.
Mom drags him off past another store window, this one full of
SCRAP METAL, with a sign reading ""AUTHENTIC FRAGMENTS OF THE
BATWING -- $19.95 and up.""  A PANHANDLER is perched at the
entrance.  Beneath his array jacket is a grubby sweatshirt

cream snack -- POLAR BARS -- oddly inappropriate for this time

A streetcorner SANTA, with bell and bucket, WAVES at the truck

have blown out of Gotham's leading jewelry store.  Gut-shot
SECURITY GUARDS stagger and go face down in the snow as
ROBBERS, dressed in white camouflage gear, clamber out through
the shattered glass with SACKFULS OF LOOT.
CAROLERS spill around the corner to see what's going on, but a
spray of GUNFIRE sends them scattering in panic.  The POLAR
BAR truck pulls even with the jewelry store, and as it does...
The REAR DOORS open.  A RAMP slides down from the back of the
truck.  The ROBBERS scramble aboard, and mere seconds later
SLIDE out AGAIN -- riding atop five SKIDOO SNOWMOBILES.

to be a BLACK SHARK FIN plowing through the snow behind him,
GAINING FAST.  He takes evasive action, but the SHARK FIN
always seems to follow.  Just as he approaches the crest of a
hill...
...the TORPEDO slams into the rear of the SNOWMOBILE.  The
force of impact knocks the ROBBER cleanly off.  His LOOT lands
in the snow beside him, but the SNOWMOBILE keeps going --
sailing over the crest of the hill and striking the rocks
beyond with a deafening EXPLOSION."|stage direction
52||ANGLE ON RIGHT SNOWMOBILE - MOVING|location
53||"This ROBBER's a little smarter than his buddy.  When he sees
the shark fin on his tail, he noses his snowmobile off into a
GROVE OF TREES.  The trees are too closely spaced for the
torpedo to maneuver; it strikes the nearest tree trunk and
explodes harmlessly.
The ROBBER is feeling good about himself, because the
Batmobile can't follow either.  But BATMAN has a Plan B.  As
he drives alongside the grove, he HITS THE ACCELERATOR,
passing the snowmobile on its left.  A STEEL SPIKE attached to
a cable launches from the side of the Batmobile and WEDGES
ITSELF into a distant TREE.
The cable goes taut, and the tree TOPPLES -- directly into the
path of the second SNOWMOBILE.  The vehicle crashes into the
trunk, and the hapless ROBBER goes cartwheeling head-over-
heels into a drift.
In the distance, COPS appear -- racing to the scene on foot,
ready for mop-up duty.  BATMAN kills the flamethrower, hits
the brakes, and FISHTAILS, doing a quick 180 on the snow.
He's just spotted fresh quarry: snowmobiles three and four,
whizzing over a rolling white pasture in the distance."|stage direction

of a frozen-over LAKE.  With the roar of the Batmobile behind
them, the two DRIVERS get the same idea simultaneously.
Smiling, they rev their engines and set out over the surface
of the lake.
Now the Batmobile crests the ridge.  The car's weight tips
suddenly and it begins to skid down the hill toward the lake.
BATMAN sees what's happening and kills the flamethrower just
in time -- but he can't brake the car on the snowy slope.  The
prow of the Batmobile slides out onto the edge of the lake --
-- and under its weight, the ICE begins to crack.  The left
front tire takes a sudden dip -- and worse yet, the car is
sliding forward."|stage direction

Fireworks?  No, it's a THERMITE BOMB -- rocketing past them,
hitting the ice some forty feet ahead and EXPLODING GAUDILY.
JAGGED CHUNKS OF ICE break free and SHIFT in the frigid water

outcroppings.  He squirts out from behind a boulder into a
clearing...
...and GASPS in PANIC as a SEARING BURST OF FLAME erupts
behind him.  The BATMOBILE speeds out from the other side of
the boulder; SANTA twists his accelerator, desperately trying
to build up speed.
As it is, he's barely managing to stay ahead of the
flamethrower.  But the jet of flame suddenly DIES; the HOOD of
the Batmobile rises half a foot --
-- and TWIN PROJECTILES launch into the air.  A heavy NET is
strung between them -- and it lands SMACK ON TOP OF SANTA
CLAUS, entangling the snowmobile and stopping him in his
tracks.
Immobilized, he watches through the net in horror as the
Batmobile barrels down.  When the great black machine is
almost atop him --
-- it stops on a dime six inches from his heavily-padded
frame."|stage direction

dragging the NET behind it -- SANTA, his loot, and his
snowmobile, all tied up in one tidy parcel.
At the entrance to the park, the NET detaches itself from the
Batmobile, dumping SANTA into the hands of the waiting COPS.
Without stopping, the BATMOBILE roars out of the park and
vanishes whence it came.  A mildly-humiliated COP turns to his

landing cat-like on the deck mere yards away.  Clad in inky
black leather from head to toe, the intruder's face is
concealed by what appears to be a BONDAGE MASK.  Studded, with
openings for the eyes and mouth, it spans one incongruous
touch: a pair of POINTED CAT EARS.
She bares her teeth and HISSES.
It's a woman.
BOAT THUG I is momentarily mesmerized.  In the time it takes
him to lift his gun, she's produced a CAT-O'-NINE-TAILS.  She
SNAPS it at him: REELS HIM IN; and with one lethal stroke,
RAKES her steel talons across his face and throat.  He slumps
to the deck, lifeless.
The other BOAT THUG rushes her; she catches him under the jaw
with a sudden upthrust, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR, and sends him
toppling into the water.
The gangplank falls aside as the steamboat pulls away from the
pier.  She hoists an abandoned ASSAULT RIFLE, SCATTERS the
DOCK GOONS with a round of automatic fire, and VAULTS off the
boat -- landing in a graceful crouch on the edge of the pier.
Most of the DOCK GOONS have taken flight, but a few unlucky
specimens remain behind.  She somersaults forward; takes one
goon off his feet with a crack of the whip; knocks another off
the dock with a twirling high-kick to the jaw; sends two more
reeling with swift talon-slashes.  The whole frenzied mop-up
action takes just under ten seconds.  Alone at last, she
stands back to survey the scene.
Counting the stiff's on the boat -- which is now receding in
the harbor -- there must be well over a dozen dead.  The snow
is speckled with red.  A half-dozen bodies lie sprawled in
their own blood; one of them, the lone survivor, is face-down
and softly MOANING.
Retracting her steel claws, the MASKED WOMAN crouches amid the
wreckage of the smashed shipping crates.  BINDLES OF WHITE
POWDER -- millions of dollars' worth -- are scattered all

A HARDHAT is dismantling a lean-to with his tire iron --
sending the terrified family inside scurrying off into the
snow -- when he glances up and sees VICKI taking his picture.
He points her out to a colleague...
...and suddenly the two of them are RUSHING TOWARD HER with
pure cold malice in their eyes.  VICKI turns to run, but it's
slow going in the snow.  She SLIPS and FALLS; her attackers
are almost upon her...
...when a SHADOWY FIGURE DIVES OUT OF THE TREES and TACKLES
one of the HARDHATS.  The FIGURE lands a powerhouse blow to
the fallen HARDHATs jaw, knocking him out cold.
The second HARDHAT turns and lifts his TIRE IRON.  But the
FIGURE, with surprising agility, is already rolling out of the
way.  As he rolls, he grabs the first guy's HARDHAT off his
head and brings it up in front of him -- blocking the blow
from the second guy's tire iron.
In the same motion, he plants a FOOT in the second HARDHAT's
belly and sends him REELING BACKWARD, HARDHAT II drops the
tire iron, and the FIGURE snatches it out of midair as he gets
to his feet.  He moves in on the second HARDHAT, BRANDISHING
the iron --
-- and while HARDHAT II is staring at it, the FIGURE HIGH-
KICKS HIM in the face.  HOP; KICK.  HOP; KICK.  The FIGURE has
nailed him three times squarely on the jaw before he can hit
the ground.
The FIGURE turns toward VICKI.  Her eyes go wide with
astonishment.
It's a KID, thirteen or fourteen at the outside, sunken-eyed,
grimy-looking, in a torn-and-tattered RAINCOAT.  She stares at
him for the briefest of instants before he rushes off to the
aid of his fellow homeless...

bats and tire irons from the fallen HARDHATS -- and the tide
turns.  The invasion is being repelled.  Faced with renewed
resistance, the few HARDHATS still left standing TURN TAIL and
race off to their VAN.
Triumph in shantytown.  The MARCHERS and HOMELESS cluster
together to lick their wounds -- and the KID, satisfied that
everything is under control, turns and sprints off toward the
trees.
But one prostrate HARDHAT is only playing dead.  As the KID
runs past, the HARDHAT extends a TIRE IRON into his path --
TRIPPING HIM, sending him sprawling in the snow.  The KID
throws up his hands as the HARDHAT prepares to smash down at
him...
CLANG.  The HARDHAT drops his tire iron and topples over,

an EQUESTRIAN STATUE in the distance.  She ups the
magnification so she can see the plaque on the pedestal.  The
stone figure on the horse is Union war hero GEN. OLIVER WAYNE

As luck would have it, the KID drops to earth not ten feet
from the statue -- VICKI's got him in her sights again.  He
looks around cautiously to make sure no one's following, then
races toward a STONE BRIDGE which arches between two small
hillocks, over a frozen creek.
