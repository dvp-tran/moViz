First Draft Screenplay"|stage direction
1||INT.  BOULEY RESTAURANT, NEW YORK - NIGHT|location
2||"Dim lighting, crowd buzz, a long line of the rich, the celebrated,
the congenitally impatient.  Everyone in this queue holds a
reservation at least an hour overdue.  Tourists can't even make the
line.  PAN ahead to...
... the burnished dining room, the tables of power, the elegant
service.  Covertly, many eyes are drawn to the one table receiving
by far the most lavish service of all.  Captains hover, presenting
delicacies, pouring wines, murmuring obsequiously to a guest whose
person they screen from our view.  We can see, however...
... the honored guest's companion.  Ignored, bemused, across the
table.  This is DIGGER DOWNES, 36, darkly attractive.  Kind eyes,
an intellectual's mouth, Saville Row's most unobtrusive and
conservative chalk-stripe suit.  He is gay, but you wouldn't guess
it.  Loyal and wise and generous, and you might.  He watches with a
quiet twinkle, as the Captains now step back, revealing to us...
... their most unlikely icon.  JULIANNE POTTER, almost 28, wears
her favorite bulky sweater over a bunch of other stuff she pulled
together in fifteen seconds.  She is unkempt, quick, volatile,
scattered, and beneath it all, perhaps because of it all, an
original beauty.  Dark liquid eyes, a cynical mouth, slender
expressive fingers, which point to..."|stage direction
3|CAPTAIN|"A variation on our squid ink
risotto.  Trace of Moselle, to
sweeten the stock."|speech
4||"She doesn't like that idea at all.  Shoots him a sharp look of
doubt that makes him smile.  Murmur..."|stage direction
5|CAPTAIN|"Don't kill us on this one, it's
a long shot."|speech
6||"Places the moist lump of black rice before her.  She takes a
surprisingly small amount, rolls it over her tongue.  Makes dead
flat eye contact with Digger.  And nods, it's actually quite nice.
The Captain breathes with relief.  She turns her dark eyes to him.
The tone says they're pals..."|stage direction
7|JULIANNE|"I'm writing it up as inventive and
confident.  Which it is.  Off the
record, I'll need an extra boat of
the ink.  Or a salt shaker."|speech
8|CAPTAIN|I'll toss a coin.|speech
9||"As the Captain splits, Digger looks around at the other tables,
which makes many pairs of eyes awkwardly glace away."|stage direction
10|DIGGER|"Is it ever embarrassing, having
your bum kissed in public?"|speech
11|JULIANNE|"If your ass isn't chapped, you
are not a good-writer of note."|speech
12||"She glances at her two remaining waiters, who shamelessly fawn
nearby."|stage direction
13|JULIANNE|"Is it sad to be an editor, and bask
only in reflected insincerity?"|speech
14|DIGGER|I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.|speech
15||She leans forward, as if sharing something conspiratorial.|stage direction
16|JULIANNE|"See the pull of a book like
Twenty Chefs, is not who I
put in.  It's who I leave out."|speech
17|DIGGER|"Which is everyone you couldn't
get in."|speech
18|JULIANNE|"Plus some guys whose food I don't
like."|speech
19||Pushes the risotte across to him.  He lifts a fork.|stage direction
20|DIGGER|"This fellow from Newsday ever
call?"|speech
21||She shrugs.  Pulls a cellular out of a large, jumbled bag.|stage direction
22|JULIANNE|"I'll buzz my machine.  Inventive
and confident, yeh?"|speech
23||She dials.  He tastes.|stage direction
24|DIGGER|Needs salt.|speech
25|JULIANNE|"Is Newsday a real interview, or
just some cute guy you're setting
me up w..."|speech
26|DIGGER|"... I don't send you men, anymore.
You don't know what to do with them."|speech
27||She's punching in her code.|stage direction
28|JULIANNE|Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.|speech
29|DIGGER|... weeks.|speech
30||Over the phone, we hear her answering machine...|stage direction
31|MAN'S VOICE (V.O., soft)|Hey.  It's Michael.|speech
32||And her face changes.  Warms.  Just to hear the guileless voice.|stage direction
33|MICHAEL (V.O.)|"God, it must be, what, months, huh?
I can't wait to talk to you.  I'm
in Chicago at the Ritz Carlton..."|speech
34||She looks impressed and surprised.  Fancy place for this guy.|stage direction
35|MICHAEL (V.O.)|"Call me four in the morning,
whatever, we gotta talk."|speech
36||"As she hangs up.  She still has that look in her eye.  Digger has
never seen that, and he likes it very much."|stage direction
37|DIGGER|"Who called? The man of the
moment?"|speech
38||"She smiles.  A sweet, natural smile that makes us like her, too.
The Bohemian sophisticate has vanished."|stage direction
39|JULIANNE|"No, no, the opposite.  That's
my best friend, Michael O'Neal.
He sounds desperate to talk."|speech
40|DIGGER|The wandering sportswriter.|speech
41||He pushes the risotto back her way.|stage direction
42|DIGGER|"I didn't know you two had a
past."|speech
43||Her gaze sharpens.  Hmmn?|stage direction
44|DIGGER|The look in your eye.|speech
45||She blushes.  Shakes her head, no way.|stage direction
46|JULIANNE|"Sophomore year at Yale we had
this one hot month.  And, you
know me, I got restless..."|speech
47||He knows her.  She got restless.|stage direction
48|JULIANNE|"So I get up the nerve to break
his heart.  I tell him there's
this dreamy exchange student
from Pakistan who wants to,
you know..."|speech
49||He knows.|stage direction
50|JULIANNE|"And he gets this... look.  He
says, ""I knew I couldn't hold
your interest"", which, of course,
makes me feel like the shallow
bitch I've always been..."|speech
51||He nods, yeah.|stage direction
52|JULIANNE|"Then he says, ""But what makes
me want to cry.  Is I'm losing
the best friend I ever had."""|speech
53||Hears the feeling.  In her voice.|stage direction
54|JULIANNE|"And when he said it, I knew.
I felt the same."|speech
55||Silence now.  She covers with a smile.|stage direction
56|JULIANNE|"So I cried.  For maybe the third
time in my life.  And I kissed
him.  And we've been best friends
ever since."|speech
57||Ever since.  Fingers turning her wine glass...|stage direction
58|JULIANNE|"Nine years, we've seen each other
through everything.  Losing jobs,
losing parents, losing lovers...
travelled all over, we've had the
best times.  The best times of my
life, maybe.  Just drinking and
talking.  Even over a phone."|speech
59|DIGGER|Kindred spirits.|speech
60|JULIANNE|"No, he's nothing like me.  He's
like you.  Only straight."|speech
61||No offense taken.|stage direction
62|JULIANNE|"He's the salt of the earth.  Kind
and loyal and generous.  The one
constant thing in my life, is he'll
always be there."|speech
63|DIGGER|He's still in love with you.|speech
64||That stops her.  She has to say...|stage direction
65|JULIANNE|"Maybe.  But it never gets in
the way."|speech
66||"Something she probably hasn't confessed out loud before.  Digger
understands."|stage direction
67|DIGGER|"Well, he has a true friend in
you."|speech
68||He wants her to know he sees that.|stage direction
69|DIGGER|"Whenever George tells someone
how steadfast I am, he always
makes me sound boring."|speech
70|JULIANNE|"Solid and genuine is not boring.
Michael can be completely insane..."|speech
71||"A young waiter arrives.  Sets a boat of black squid ink beside her
plate."|stage direction
72|JULIANNE|"There was this one night in
Tucson, like six years ago...
we got amazingly drunk, I mean,
Keith Richards time..."|speech
73||The kid tops off her glass of meursault.  Looking at her.|stage direction
74|JULIANNE|"God, I haven't thought of this
in so long..."|speech
75||The waiter hanging now.  Openly listening.|stage direction
76|JULIANNE|"I can even believe we did
this..."|speech
77||"Digger sees the guy listening, gestures to her with his eyes.  So
she looks up."|stage direction
78|JULIANNE|Could you give us a minute?|speech
79||The kid stunned, speechless.  People lose jobs for a lot less.|stage direction
80|JULIANNE|"You won't miss much, I promise
there was no sex."|speech
81||He reddens and disappears.|stage direction
82|DIGGER|I've lost interest.|speech
83|JULIANNE|"He takes a razor from his dinky
little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip,
takes my hand, does the same to me..."|speech
84||She places the tips of her index fingers together.|stage direction
85|DIGGER|Blood oath.|speech
86|JULIANNE|"He says, ""Swear.  When we're both
28, if we've never been married...
we marry each other!"""|speech
87||"And laughs again.  Can you believe that?  But Digger isn't smiling.
She wonders why.  Begins to spoon black squid ink onto her risotto."|stage direction
88|JULIANNE|"See, he figured that would be a
sign from God, or someone of
comparable authority, that we'd
misunderstood our destinies."|speech
89||He still has this real serious look.  She's still spooning ink.|stage direction
90|JULIANNE|"We never talked about it again.  I
don't know what made me think of..."|speech
91|DIGGER (quietly)|I do.|speech
92||"And everything.  Stops.  She lifts her spoon, mesmerized by the
gravity of his tone."|stage direction
93|DIGGER|"You'll be 28 in three weeks.
How old is he?"|speech
94||"Holy.  Fucking.  Shit.  It hits her like a ton of lead bricks.  She
shovels some swampy risotto into her mouth, without looking."|stage direction
95|JULIANNE|You think...|speech
96|DIGGER|Desperate.  To talk.|speech
97||She shovels in more drippy black goop.  It is really disgusting.|stage direction
98|JULIANNE|"He's not proposing marriage,
there's no way I'm buying one
word of th..."|speech
99|DIGGER|"Then why are you compulsively
eating? If you're not hysterical?"|speech
100||"More goes in.  Her lips and mouth completely black.  Like a circus
clown."|stage direction
101|JULIANNE|He can't do that to me!|speech
102|DIGGER|We're about to find out.|speech
103||"Ink is now dribbling out of the black hole of her mouth and down
her face.  She absently dabs a napkin, keeping some of it from
reaching her sweater."|stage direction
104|JULIANNE|When I turn him down...|speech
105||She realizes the full weight of the truth.|stage direction
106|JULIANNE|We'll never be the same.|speech
107|DIGGER|I have a suggestion...|speech
108|JULIANNE|"I'll have to kill myself before I
call him."|speech
109||Staring in each other's eyes.|stage direction
110|DIGGER (sadly)|That was it.|speech
111||INT. JULIANNE'S BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT|location
112||"Julianne furiously scrubs her blackened tongue with a toothbrush.
Gray foam pours from her mouth, spattering the oversized basketball
jersey she wears as a nightshirt.  In the mirror, her troubled eyes
dwell on Michael, flick to the cordless phone standing ominously on
the closed toilet lid.
She spits, sticks her tongue way out.  Incredibly black.  Great.
Depressed, terrified, and disfigured for life.  She snatches up the
hated phone, and wanders aimlessly into...
... her bedroom.  West Village view.  Defiantly jumbled, aggres-
sively eclectic.  Traces of wonderful taste mixed with I-like-it-
you-got-a-problem-with-that? She stumbles around, rehearsing..."|stage direction
113|JULIANNE|"This is awkward timing, Michael,
I just joined this convent, and
they never give your deposit ba..."|speech
114||"Stops.  Full-length mirror.  She straightens her hair, to look her
best."|stage direction
115|JULIANNE|Michael, I'm married.|speech
116||Not enough.|stage direction
117|JULIANNE|... and I have two weeks to live.|speech
118||Changes tone...|stage direction
119|JULIANNE|"Michael, I'm trying to be gay,
don't confuse me."|speech
120||"She turns to continue pacing, and walks straight INTO a dresser.
Stuns her, momentarily.  Enough, already! She punches up the
number, primping absently in the mirror.  When it connects..."|stage direction
121|JULIANNE|"I was calling Michael O'Neal,
but seeing it's so late, I could
just leave a mes..."|speech
122||No such luck.  Cut off.  Waits.  And then...|stage direction
123|JULIANNE (soft)|"Good evening, sir.  You've been
enrolled in the Obscene Call Of
The Month Club, and th..."|speech
124|MICHAEL (V.O.)|"Hey! God, it's so good to hear
your voice."|speech
125||She forgets herself.  Because it's good to hear his, too.|stage direction
126|MICHAEL (V.O.)|I've been calling for days!|speech
127|JULIANNE|"Yeh, well my old machine kept
eating messages.  I tried
constructively ignoring it in
hopes of improvement, but finally..."|speech
128|MICHAEL (V.O., urgent)|Look, I have to ask you something.|speech
129||She swallows.|stage direction
130|MICHAEL (V.O.)|"Something so incredibly important,
that if you turn me down, I don't
know what I'll d..."|speech
131|JULIANNE (bright)|"I just have to tell you this one
thing first, okay? I mean this
will hand you the biggest laugh
of your adult life..."|speech
132||Silence.  Come on girl, suck it up.|stage direction
133|JULIANNE|"I was thinking about you, and I
remembered this unbelievably insane
night we spent together in Tucson,
like a thousand years ago?"|speech
134||More silence.  Really quiet.|stage direction
135|JULIANNE|"I mean, there's no way you could
possibly remember the..."|speech
136|MICHAEL (V.O., soft)|Are you kidding?|speech
137||Stops her.  Like a brick wall.  The sweetness in his voice.|stage direction
138|MICHAEL (V.O.)|"I think about that night all
the time."|speech
139||She's going to have a heart attack.|stage direction
140|MICHAEL (V.O.)|But it's not why I called.|speech
141||"She blinks.  It's not.  And just as a tsunami of relief begins to
sweep away..."|stage direction
142|MICHAEL (V.O.)|I called because I met someone.|speech
143||"And her smiles breaks off.  Like a spine snapping.  Because there is
something in his voice."|stage direction
144|JULIANNE|"Well, that's great.  You haven't
really had anybody since Dingbat
Jennylee..."|speech
145|MICHAEL (V.O.)|"You don't understand.  I've never
felt this way about anybody!"|speech
146||Never.  She sits down, hard.  Right on the floor.|stage direction
147|MICHAEL (V.O.)|And she's all wrong for me!|speech
148|JULIANNE|Well, somet...|speech
149|MICHAEL (V.O.)|"I mean she's a junior at Chicago
University, she's twenty years
old! Like when I first met you."|speech
150||Like when.  Julianne's mouth is suddenly dry.|stage direction
151|MICHAEL (V.O.)|"And her dad is like this billionaire
who owns the White Sox and some cable
empire, and you know how I've always
been miserably awkward around those
kinda stuffed suits..."|speech
152||She's finally making her mouth work...|stage direction
153|JULIANNE|Well, sure.|speech
154|MICHAEL (V.O.)|"But they're so down to earth, such
wonderful people..."|speech
155|JULIANNE|You've met her parents.|speech
156|MICHAEL (V.O., quiet)|Well.  Sure.|speech
157||Wow.|stage direction
158|MICHAEL (V.O.)|"See.  We're getting married.
This Sunday."|speech
159||There's a knife in her heart.  She can scarcely breathe.|stage direction

you can't possibly be getting
married on Su..."|speech
161|MICHAEL (V.O.)|"Actually, it all starts tomorrow.
It's one of those four-day weddings,
with all the traditional events, and
ten million people flying in from
Madagascar such."|speech
162|JULIANNE (incredibly lame)|"Aren't you... working this weekend?
I mean, is that responsible?"|speech
163|MICHAEL (V.O.)|"Well, the Sox are at home.  SI's
letting me do a profile on the Big
Hurt.  That's Frank..."|speech

her life."|stage direction

179||"The closet, the armoire, all the drawers are wide open.  Two huge
suitcases open on the bed, into which Julianne is flinging clothes,

now..."|stage direction
180|DIGGER (V.O., machine)|"You've reached Digger and George.
Brevity will be appreciated."|speech
181||BEEP.|stage direction
182|JULIANNE (in a rage)|"IT'S ME AGAIN, WHY AREN'T YOU GUYS
UP HAVING SAFE SEX??"|speech
183||SNATCHES up a tiny, clingy, sexy dress.  Pouts at it.|stage direction

YOU INTERRUPTING IT TO ANSWER
THE PHONE??"|speech
185||She holds the dress against her body.  It's hot.|stage direction
186|JULIANNE|"YOU, YOU, YOU! IT'S ALL ABOUT

die in four days.  Go to Plan B."|speech
191||She sucks deep.  Really deep.|stage direction
192|JULIANNE|"You have no appropriate sense
of emergency.  My best friend
is ruining his life."|speech
193|DIGGER|No, he's ruining yours.|speech
194|JULIANNE|"Same difference.  If you love
someone, it's your duty to save
them from themselves."|speech
195|DIGGER|"You have a real philosophy of
life."|speech
196|JULIANNE|"It's called the Law of Love,
asshole."|speech

out at the skycaps, clinging to her cigarette, as he eases to the
curb."|stage direction

could catch a later fl..."|speech

days to break up a wedding, and
steal the bride's fella."|speech

201|JULIANNE|"He's adored me for nine goddamn
years."|speech
202|DIGGER|I can see why.|speech
203|JULIANNE|"She knows him maybe five seconds,
plus she has billions of dollars,
plus she's perfect, so don't go
feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!"|speech
204||He's not.  So her voice softens.  Which shows the hurt.|stage direction
205|JULIANNE|"And don't go feeling sorry for
me, you don't know me that well.
We're only friends."|speech

only bride with her own best man."|speech

called O'Hare.  Julianne lugging multiple carry-ons, trying to pull
fly-away strands of hair into place, nervous as a schoolgirl,
looking all around, and...
... there he is.  MICHAEL is tall and square-shouldered, a boyish
grin, an unruly shock of hair.  He looks gorgeous, sweet, and just
dangerous enough to be irresistible.  Worthwhile stakes.  His face
lights to see her, and she...
... RUNS to his arms, shedding bags along the way, slamming off
heedless civilians, to be...
... SWEPT OFF the earth in strong arms, spun around, laughing like
crazy, their cheeks tight together.  When he sets her down...
... he kisses her nose.  His arms are still around her."|stage direction

I'm actually gonna do this?"|speech
220|JULIANNE (lost in his eyes)|Not hardly.|speech
221||"He beams.  Turns.  She follows his gaze, and...
... there she is.  KIMBERLY WALLACE is 20, small and slender, but it
is a body to die for.  The face is striking, not at all perky and
vapid, but lovely and interesting.  Worst of all, intelligent.
She walks toward them purposefully, her eyes locked to the woman in
her fiancee's arms.  At the last moment, Michael releases Julianne
and Kimmy...
... THROWS her arms around the startled visitor.  HOLDS her tight,
with such genuine warmth that Julianne can only, slowly, hug back.
As Michael beams."|stage direction

perfect."|speech

roar of the wind makes it impossible for him to hear them."|stage direction

Right off, I have to ask this
monstrous favor..."|speech

cost to bring in a temp."|speech

bridesmaid?  Someone you know
for at least forty-five minutes."|speech
253||"We CUT OFF a huge SEMI who BLASTS his horn.  Kimmy fearless,
oblivious, and analytical..."|stage direction
254|KIMMY|"The bridesmaids are my only two
female relatives under forty.
Identical twin debutantes from
Nashville, who are basically
vengeful sluts.  With amazing
bodies!"|speech
255|JULIANNE|"Which was the disqualifying
factor?"|speech
256|KIMMY|"The twin part.  I like to remain
impartial in my contempt."|speech
257||"Sees the off-ramp, and SLICES across FOUR LANES of speeding bullets
in a heart-stopping nanosecond.  This kid could drive for Penske.
Julianne has to pound her chest to get her heart started.  Looks

beach club.  Clutching her bag, she quickly surveys the scene...
... the entire beach has been taken over by the wedding party.
Young folks, old folks, little kids, maybe 200 people.  We SCAN
with her to find a crowd around...
... a three-on-three volleyball game.  Kimmy and two groomsmen on
one side, facing Michael and the Tennessee debs.  The twins wear
spectacular bikinis and are surprisingly athletic, as well as
predictably uninhabited.  As the next point begins, Kimmy serves...
... Sammy in back makes a nice dig, lobbing to Mandy who sets for
Michael's vicious SPIKE straight THROUGH his best man's hapless
defense.  The crowd cheers Michael, and as he turns, Mandy gives
him a savage...
... CHEST BUMP of congratulation, that any NFL linebacker would be
proud of.  It puts the surprised Michael straight on his butt.
Laughter, applause.  The twins pull him up and Sammy gives him a
hot kiss on his ear that makes the crowd react.  Kim plays good
sport.  Julianne watches Michael's body for a beat, then...
... dashes off.  Down the beach, several barbecue grills have been
set up.  Manned by beach club staff and family alike.  Michael's
pop, Joe, is dispensing beers from a keg.  Kim's mom, Isabelle, is
coordinating the beans, potato salad and corn-on-the-cob table.
Julianne races across the sand to...
... a huge smoky grill where Walter is basting baby back ribs,
clearly enjoying himself.  Julianne runs up to him, says something
into his ear.  He looks at her.  Then turns his station over to a
club steward, and follows Julianne down toward the lakeside.
CLOSE now.  As they stroll together, she's a little breathless.
He's watching her profile, curious, silent.  At the water's edge..."|stage direction

struggles against the flow, suddenly panicked by the certainty
that she will never see him before...

so tight.  An embrace so wonderful, so terrible, she could go mad
from the confusion alone.  Against the din, he murmurs in her
ear..."|stage direction
