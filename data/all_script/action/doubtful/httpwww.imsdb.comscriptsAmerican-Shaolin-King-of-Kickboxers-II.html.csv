The students are doing their own thing, and they are a mixture of old

be in a Karate school: they are dressed in old T-shirts and tattered
sweat pants. This is not a wealthy school, by any means, and that is
typified by the appearance of SIFU KWAN, who is walking through the
students as they train. He is wizened old man, 70 years old if he is
a day, and he is dressed in a fraying Chinese jacket, scruffy cloth
shoes and a discolored Chinese T-shirt.

RODRIGUEZ, and she is holding a uniform of some sort. She smiles
widely at him and holds up the uniform. It is beautiful, obviously

and her head down. She is not sure Drew wants to see her.
Drew looks at her, then back to San De, but he is already gone. They
are alone.
Drew walks to her, takes her chin in his hand and tilts it up to look
at her face. Her eyes are full of love and tenderness, and a little
fear.
Drew kisses that fear away."|stage direction

Soon, Drew tires of this game and decides to end this    quickly. He
goes after Trevor, and it is immediately obvious that    Trevor is
completely outclassed. Drew scores on Trevor at will,    and soon has
Trevor totally confused and helpless with a mixture of    high kicks,
takedowns, flips and punches.
Trevor drops to one knee, his hands down at his side, note even
bothering to defend himself.
Drew grabs Trevor by the front of his uniform and pulls back his
right hand in a fist. He is going to put him out with a good old-
fashioned roundhouse punch.

Yelling for the knock out blow.
ANGLE ON D.S. AND SAN DE
Worried about this latest development.
Instead, however, Drew smiles and lifts Trevor up and shakes his
hand, putting an arm around him to steady him in front of the crowd.
Trevor looks into Drew's face, wondering why Drew would do such a
thing. When he sees Drew's friendly face, he knows.
To teach him a lesson.
Trevor smiles and holds up Drew's hand as the champion.

Drew takes it and San De bows to him. Drew can't stand it anymore,

Who is not used to shows of affection. He is lost for a moment, then
