Rips through his clothes right down to the skin. Roper's gun
CLATTERS under a parked car and into the street. Clarence
has first jump. He scrambles into the street, around the car

Clearing the building sees Roper's PICKUP. He runs to it,
jumping inside, finding the KEYS in the ignition. He starts
the truck, pulling out, just as Roper runs into view.

With the truck accelerating towards him he raises and FIRES,
two bullet holes in the front WINDSHIELD, missing Korda, the

leaps, sliding forward on the hood, almost falling as he
grabs on to the empty window frame and the windshield wiper
blades for support, his WEAPON flying from his hand.

Korda then caroms off the sides of buildings, left, right,
SPARKS flying, then smashes into BOXES, CRATES, anything he
can see stacked alongside the road way, but Roper stays put,
clinging on with all he's got, swinging from side to side to
avoid the obstacles.
Then Korda SEES ahead a huge pile of BOXES, WOOD FRAMING,
PALLETS, TRASH, stacked at the side of a building. He hammers
the pedal, driving the right side of the truck into the
pile... BOXES, WOOD, PAPER, DEBRIS flying everywhere, through
the open fron window as well, Korda shielding his eyes with
his arm as OBJECTS fly around in a mad flurry inside the
cab...
ROPER
In the maelstrom lets go his grip, grabbing the upper frame
of the window and assisted by the speed of the truck, rolls
over the top of the cab, landing in the bed of the truck
along with BOXES, LUMBER, and TRASH.
KORDA
Clears his eyes, looking up, Roper is gone! He LAUGHS
hysterically... he knocked him off!
ROPER IN THE BED OF THE TRUCK
Leaning out the passenger's side SEES they are approaching
the dry dock area.
In the bed of the truck, along with the BOXES, SUITCASES and
other objects, he sees several long 2x4's. Grabbing a BOARD
he braces himself against the cab and then in one swift
movement, stands, swinging to the driver's side, driving the
2x4 through the side window, through the steering wheel,
past the dash and catching the tip of the ACCELERATOR PEDAL,
pinning it to the floor.
As Roper releases the board it WEDGES inside the door frame,
locking the wheel and the accelerator, the engine SCREAMING
wide open. Korda reacts in panic...
Roper clings to the cab, looking over the top, the DRY DOCK
looming towards them. He prepares to jump...
KORDA
Suddenly SEES the approaching dry dock. He jams on the brakes,
but it's not enough, the truck racing towards the edge...
IN SLOW MOTION THE TRUCK
Vaults over the edge of the dry dock as Roper runs down the
bed, leaping off the tail gate, arms windmilling as he goes
airborne...
The truck plummets towards the bottom...
ROPER
Lands in a huge pile of CARGO NETS and CARDBOARD BOXES, piled
near the edge of the dry dock...
