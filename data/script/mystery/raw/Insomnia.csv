A TUMBLE OF HAIR

FINGERNAILS

EYEBROWS

PANTY-HOSE

it.  Places them in a big, clear, plastic bag.  In the bag we
see the panty-hose, a folded flower dress, the nail

Goes back to combing.  Comes across a knot and yanks the comb
through.  The HEAD rolls over to us.  Her face is bruised,

of Byrd, standing in front of a big, lakeside HOUSE.  A RADIO
TOWER in the background.  Walter Byrd's face is blurred,
turned to the side.  The photo from the book bio.
Will takes it.  Starts roughly opening drawers.  A box of
animal crackers, a rubber band ball.  Then, shoved in the
back of the top drawer, an APPOINTMENT BOOK.  Will flips
through to today's date.  Blank.  Shoves the book into his
pocket.  Slams the door closed.
Then reaches back for his Smith 39/13.  Checks the magazine.
