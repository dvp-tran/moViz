Jenny orders Marley to sit; instead Marley jumps up on her
and puts his paws on her shoulders. She presses his butt to
the ground, and he rolls over for a belly rub. She tries to
tug him into place and he grabs the leash in his teeth,
shaking it playfully.
MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)

believe he is the alpha male of his

be slack. If he pulls, it tightens
around his neck like a noose and
loosens as soon as he stops pulling."|speech|JOHN|M|True

ahead, administer a correction by

lurches ahead of the pack..."|speech|JOHN|M|True

on his hind legs, then barrels up and lurches forward.
Ms. Kornblut half-stumbles, half rockets across the park.
She manages to turn Marley around, and the whole process
begins again as they make their way back to the line. Her
face is flushed with embarrassment, anger, and exertion, but
Marley, jowls frothing, is having a ball. It's like a
walking tug-of-war.
With difficulty, Ms. Kornblut manages to return Marley to
John, but not before, as a coup-de-grace, he starts humping
her leg enthusiastically. She struggles, he knocks her down,
and then he buries his face in her crotch and humps her knee.
