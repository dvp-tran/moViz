gets out, pulls two heavily loaded barracks bags after him.
He pays the driver, hoists the bags to his back, moves toward
camera. The taxi drives away slowly. The soldier walks toward
steps leading to a low building. He is PREWITT (called ""PREW""
for short), 22 years old, well-built, good-looking. He wears
an enlisted man's uniform and on the sleeves are marks where
chevrons have been removed. He pauses, looks up over the

out of the screen door and into shot. He is wielding a frayed

26||"TRUCKING SHOT ALONG COMPANY STREET
Prew walks slowly down the raised porch alongside the street.
He takes the mouthpiece of a bugle from his pocket, jiggles
it idly, a habit of his. He comes to the Dayroom, glances
through the screen door, goes in."|stage direction

MEDIUM SHOT"|location
28||"The Dayroom has a pool table, ping-pong table, a radio, etc.
Moth-eaten, upholstered chairs line both walls. The place is
empty as Prew enters. He looks around casually, sees the pool
table in an alcove. He moves over to it, puts the bugle
mouthpiece in his pocket, picks a cue from the rack on the
wall. He switches on the light, chalks the cue.
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT
The triangle of balls is already racked on the table. Prew
addresses the cue ball, shoots and breaks the rack solidly.
He watches the balls hurry around the table."|stage direction

33|PREW|I heard about you, too, Warden.|speech

along. This here's a rifle outfit,

door bangs and CAPTAIN DANA HOLMES enters shot. He wears
cavalry boots and spurs. He is about forty, unsure of

pleasantly."|stage direction

to talk to my new men. It's
important for an officer and his
men to understand each other. Now I
have a fine smooth-running outfit."|speech

Holmes cannot see Warden who is grinning at Prewitt with
unholy glee."|stage direction
63|HOLMES|"Plenty of room for advancement for
a man who knows how to soldier. But
he's got to show me he's got it on
the ball. I don't know what you've
been used to in the Bugle Corps,
but in my outfit we run it by the
book. What kind of trouble were you
in over there?

64|PREW|No trouble, sir.|speech
65|HOLMES|What made you transfer out, then?|speech
66|PREW|It's a personal matter, air.|speech

chair, watching hawk-like."|stage direction
69|HOLMES|"Something you wanted to ask,
Sergeant?"|speech
70|"WARDEN
(EXPLODES SUDDENLY)"|"Who? Me? Whv, yes, air. You had
Corpral's stripes in the Bugle
Corps, Prewitt. You took a bust to
buck Private to transfer to an
Infantry Compny. Why? Because you
like to hike?"|speech
71|PREW|"I dint have no trouble if that's
what you mean."|speech
72|"WARDED
(GRINS SUDDENLY)"|"Or was it just because you couldn't
stand to bugle?"|speech
73|PREW|It was a personal matter.|speech
74|WARDEN|"That's up to the Compny Commander's
discretion to decide."|speech
75|PREW|"(looks straight at Warden)
All right. I was First Bugler at
Shafter for two years. The topkick
had a friend who transferred in
from the states. Next day he made
him First Bugler over me.

76|WARDEN|"And you asked out on account of
that!?"|speech
77|PREY|"Maybe I just ain't sensible... But
that's the reason."|speech
78|"WARDEN
(SNORTS)"|"His feelings were hurt! Kids they
send us now!"|speech
79||"Warden swings his chair around, absorbs himself in work at
his desk as if the Prew situation is too absurd to concern
himself with. Holmes speaks blandly, winningly."|stage direction
80|HOLMES|"I've got a mighty sour Company
Bugler here... but I suppose you
wouldn't want that job."|speech
81|PREY|No, air.|speech
82|"HOLMES
(SMILES)"|"Well, we'll get your stripes back
for you, maybe an extra one for
good measure. You know why you were
sent over here when you requested
transfer?"|speech
83|PREW|No, sir.|speech
84|HOLDS|"I pulled a few strings. I'm the
Regimental Boxing Coach, Prewitt. I
saw your fight with Connors in the
Bowl year before last. With any
luck you should have won it. I
thought for a while, in the second
round, you were going to knock him
out."|speech

Quit fighting? When? What for?"|speech

Maybe you heard about what
happened..."|speech

96||"During this shot Maggio can be seen in b.g. through door to
Orderly Room. He pretends to be sweeping, but stops now and
then to listen."|stage direction
97|HOLMES|"Yes, it's too bad about that. I can
understand how you feel. But those
things happen in this game. A man
has got to accept that possibility
when he fights."|speech
98|PREW|"That's why I decided I would quit,
sir."|speech
99|"HOLMES
(LESS WARMLY)"|But on the other hand, look at|speech

101|HOLMES(CONT'D)|"it this way. What if all fighters
felt like that?"|speech
102|PREW|They don't.|speech
103|HOLMES|"Would you have us disband our
fighting program because one man
got hurt?"|speech
104|PREW|No, sir. I dint say --|speech
105|HOLMES|"You might as well say stop war
because one man got killed. Our
fighting program is the best morale
builder we have off here away from
home."|speech
106|PREW|I don't want it disbanded, sir.|speech
107|(DOGGEDLY)|"But I don't see why any man should
fight unless he wants to."|speech
108|HOLMES|"It looks to me like you're trying
to acquire a reputation as a lone
wolf, Prewitt. You should know that
in the Army it's not the individual
that counts. If a man wants to get
ahead he has certain
responsibilities to fulfill that go
beyond the regulations. It might
look as though I were a free agent,
but I'm not. Nobody is."|speech
109||"Holmes waits hopefully for a moment, then realizes Prew is
not going to respond further. He stands. Prew snaps to
attention."|stage direction
110|HOLMES|"Maybe you'll change your mind. In
the meantime just don't make any
mistakes in my outfit."|speech

anything else for me today,
Sergeant?

No, sir!"|speech

If there's anything that has to go
in this afternoon, sign my name. I
won't be back."|speech
116||"He goes out, crossing Warden's desk and knocking a wire
basket filled with papers on the floor. In a moment, the
sound of the screen door slamming is heard. Warden picks up
the papers."|stage direction

weren't here to swab out his throat
for him."|speech

135||They resume walking.|stage direction
136|WARDEN|"You'll fight, Prewitt. You'll fight
because Captain Holmes got a bee in
his hat he needs a winnin team to
make Mayor. And if you don't do it
for him you'll do it for me. I only
been in this outfit eight months
myself but I learned one thing. My
job is to keep him happy. The more
he's happy the less he bothers me
and the better I run his Compny. So
we know where we stand, don't we,
