FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT

1||"OVER BLACK WE HEAR THE DULL SOUNDS OF INDUSTRY; A MUFFLED
MASS OF MACHINES, GEARS, STEAM. FADE IN ON:
A SIGN. Twelve feet across. Painted decades earlier, grim-
covered black, white and red. It reads in large 40's era,
hand-painted type, ""SAFETY IS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN!"" Then:
""DAYS SINCE LAST ACCIDENT"" and below that, NUMBERS, painted
on hanging metal cards. Four possible digits can hang here,
but there are currently three: ""784.""
SLOWLY PUSH IN on this sign as a MAN APPEARS, rising on a
forklift, in a greasy, monochromatic work jumpsuit. Removes
the ""4"" from its hooks. Then removes the ""8."" Then the ""7.""
Finally, he hangs up a number. ""1.""
The man LOWERS out of frame as we creep even closer to the
hanging single digit, wondering about the accident... and how
bad it was and the FACTORY SOUNDS GROW DEAFENING -- AND AS IT
BUILDS TO A CRESCENDO, WE CUT TO SILENT BLACKNESS."|stage direction||

3||"Shiny black loafers. Black pants, three inches too long. We
BOOM UP, stopping at a boy's hand reaching into the black
suit jacket pocket. Pulls out a WOMAN'S GOLD NECKLACE with a
LOCKET. He holds the locket. Rubs it gently with his thumb.
CONTINUE TO BOOM UP. We now SEE THE BOY'S FACE.
This is JOE LAMB, 14. On the precarious edge of adulthood. He
looks out at the horizon with stricken eyes.
He moves forward and we PAN, so we're BEHIND HIM NOW. In the
frosty distance, past countless leafless trees and modest
homes, is a STEEL MILL. Smokestacks and structures. The
lifeblood of this late 70's town."|stage direction||

39||EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER|location||
40||"A WIDE SHOT. A grey, snow-covered, early February day here in
LILLIAN, OHIO. Many cars are parked outside the house,
notably a SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SQUAD CAR in the driveway.
Joe, a vision of black on white in his too-big black suit,
now sits on a small swing set he hasn't used in years.
He solemnly looks down at the LOCKET he still holds. No doubt
trying to reconcile the fact that it no longer hangs around
his mother's neck. Then a SOUND. Joe looks up. A CAR has
arrived -- a distinct 1968 BUICK GSX -- a YELLOW MUSCLE CAR
with a BLACK RACING STRIPE down its center. Joe watches as
the car sits there for a moment. Then a MAN gets out. Someone
Joe has seen before, but doesn't know personally. A man in
his early 40's, in jeans and a work shirt. He's not exactly
sloppy, but if you look closely, you could tell he's been
drinking. This is LOUIS DAINARD.
Joe watches Louis carefully as he moves to the house, to the
porch and inside the house. Joe's eyes glued on the house for
a while. Then he looks back to the locket. He OPENS IT, and
stares at the picture inside (which we do not see). And as he
stares, TEARS come to his eyes.
A moment broken by the SOUND OF RAISED VOICES -- Joe turns
toward the house. After a beat, the SOUND of something
BREAKING -- something glass. Then the house BACK DOOR bursts
open -- Joe cranes his neck -- and what he sees he'll never
forget: his father, Jack, leading an in-pain and HAND-CUFFED
Louis Dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad
car. When he slams the back door, he sees Joe. Sort of
freezes as their eyes lock. But Jack's more uncomfortable"|stage direction||

42|JACK|I'll be home soon.|speech|JACK|M
43||"And Jack gets into the car and drives away. Joe watches them
drive off. And after a beat, he looks down at the locket
again. Mom's just gone. Finally he CLOSES IT -- and we hear
an oddly LOUD SNAP and our SCREEN GOES BLACK.
Over darkness: APPLAUSE -- then a LONE VOICE: ""I want you...
to want me!"" DRUMS kick in, CHEAP TRICK BLASTS. CUT TO:"|stage direction||

92||"DARKNESS. Then a DOOR OPENS. It's DETECTIVE HATHAWAY (played
by MARTIN), in silhouette. He enters. It's an old WAREHOUSE,
dirty, cobwebbed, crowded with CRATES, old MACHINERY,
CHEMICAL BARRELS and JUNK. The Detective turns on his
FLASHLIGHT -- aims it -- sweeps it across the space -- the
light HITTING THE LENS for a moment.
The Detective walks through the spooky, dark space. A low,
growling industrial DRONE makes the whole place oddly creepy.
Then: A SOUND -- quick but strange -- slithering -- and the
Detective aims his flashlight -- tense. He watches. Waits. We
see where he's aiming the light, which cuts through THICK
DUST in the air. It's an old office door, ajar.
Hathaway is still. Nervous. Watching the door -- waiting for
it to open... and then -- from the darkness BEHIND HIM -- a
terrifying open-mouthed ZOMBIE APPEARS -- ATTACKS -- and the
Detective TURNS -- his flashlight KNOCKED TO THE GROUND --
and Hathaway falls too -- the wild-eyed gaping-mouthed Zombie
DROOLING as it tries to bite Hathaway's flesh -- we recognize
that the Zombie is CARY. Actually, not a bad performance. The
Detective pulls out his GUN -- but the Zombie grabs his wrist
-- they wrestle with the gun -- the Zombie wanting to rip
into Hathaway's neck -- but Hathaway sees three SHARP-TIPPED
NAILS sticking out of an old piece of WOODEN CRATE -- and
after a significant struggle, Hathaway PUSHES THE ZOMBIE BACK
so his head is IMPALED BY THE NAILS -- which we see ENTER HIS
SKULL!!! The Zombie (stuck to the crate via the nails)
