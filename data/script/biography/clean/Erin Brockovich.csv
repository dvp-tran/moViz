A True Story

February 1, 1998"|unknown||
1||EXT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SUBURB, MAIN DRAG - DAY|location||
2||"Palms sway ... the sun washes everything in yellow ... cars
motor down either side of the landscaped median ... the calls
of mockingbirds mingle with the BLIP BLIP of car alarms.
ON THE SIDEWALK, a SKATEBOARD CA-LUNKS down the sidewalk,
past the foot traffic of Southern Californians: flip-flops,
Doc Marten's, Rollerblades, Nikes ... then, in the middle of
this pedestrian normalcy, a pair of IMPOSSIBLY HIGH SPIKE-
HEELED PUMPS struts out of a shop.  So high it hurts to look
at them.  As the shoes leave frame, we TILT UP and see
they're leaving a 99-cent store.
As the Pumps turn and head up the street, we see they are
connected to a pair of IMPOSSIBLY LONG, SHAPELY LEGS.
Eveready legs -- they just keep going and going.
They saunter past two BUSINESSMEN on a lunch break.  The men
pause and glance as men tend to when they see a beautiful
woman.  In fact, everyone this woman passes lets their eyes
rest on her a microsecond longer than usual.
- Two SKATEBOARDERS note the STRETCHY MICRO-MINI skimming the
tops of her thighs.
- A MAILMAN spots the BIG, DARK SUNGLASSES tucked into a
MOUNTAIN OF BIG, BLOND HAIR.
- A PRE-TEEN GIRL glimpses the PLUNGING NECKLINE of the
TIGHT, BRIGHT RED MIDRIFF-BARING BUSTIER.
It isn't until she rounds the corner at the end of the block
that we see her entire figure and appreciate why everyone is
so goggle-eyed.  Eye-catching is an understatement.  All
those folks who say Barbie's proportions are unrealistic have
obviously never met ERIN BROCKOVICH."|stage direction||
3||EXT. AROUND THE CORNER - DAY|location||

TICKET flaps under the wiper of an old Hyundai."|stage direction||
5|ERIN|Fuck.|speech|ERIN|F
6||"Even when she talks dirty, there's a heartland goodness to
her voice.  Like Kansas corn fields swaying in the breeze.
As she grabs the ticket from the windshield, her sunglasses
accidentally CLATTER to the ground."|stage direction||

it."|unknown||
11||"She tends to the nail as she opens her car door and gets in.
WIDER ON THE STREET
The Hyundai starts it up, signals.  Then, just as it pulls
slowly out into the street, a JAGUAR barrels around the
corner, accelerating out of the turn, and rams into the side
of Erin's car, sending it CAREENING into the median.  It
SMASHES into a foot-thick lightpost.  And stops."|stage direction||
12||EXT. MASRY & VITITOE - DAY|location||

the reception desk reads: MASRY & VITITOE, ATTORNEYS AT LAW.
ED MASRY, senior partner, slumps by ROSALIND, his chipper
receptionist, with a cup of coffee in his hand.  He's in his
mid-50's, compact and -- even though it's only 9 AM --
already rumpled."|stage direction||

unopened mail.  Standing in the middle of the room is Erin,
