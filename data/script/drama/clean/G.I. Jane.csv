Reading from prepared material:"|stage direction|||

In her arsenal she carries conversational hand-grenades --

""typing""?  ""Restocking the

Hayes?"|speech|DEHAVEN|F|True

stone-faced.  Hayes forces a smile."|stage direction|||

10|DEHAVEN|"Well, I'm just an old dame without
much time left, so you'll pardon me
if I jump right in here before they
discontinue my blood-type.  I am
deeply concerned over the Navy's

aviator in question failed to
execute a proper approach to the
carrier."|speech|HAYES|M|True
