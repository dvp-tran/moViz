A Screenplay by
Chris Columbus
FIRST DRAFT

1||"UNDERWATER - CLOSE-UP: A brightly colored FLY, attached to a dangling,
fishing line. A large SALMON swims to the fly. The salmon EXAMINES the
fly, deciding whether or not to bite.
CAMERA PANS UPWARD, tracking the line and moving OUT OF THE WATER. We
PASS the crooked boards of a small ROWBOAT and continue to PAN UPWARD.
A MAN reclines in the boat. NAPPING. His hands gently grip a WOODEN
FISHING POLE. He is handsomely dressed in SPORTSMAN'S trousers and a
blazer. His green, tweed fishing hat is lowered OVER HIS FACE. Its
brim is filled with various types of TACKLE and BAIT.
It is DUSK. A warm, SUMMER evening. The boat rests on a calm lake,
surrounded by MOORS. Thick night FOG has begun to settle over the
entire area.
TITLE: SCOTLAND. 1937.
Suddenly, the man's fishing line becomes TAUT. The wooden pole
BUCKLES. The man STIRS. He SITS UP, moving the hat from his face.
CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, into a CLOSE UP of the man. It is INDIANA
JONES. His face ANXIOUS... HOPEFUL... Indy begins to REEL in his
catch.
A VOICE interrupts. In the DISTANCE."|stage direction

3||"Indy TURNS to the direction of the sound, still STRUGGLING with the
line.
INDIANA'S POV
Countless ORANGE FLAMES sparkle across the moors. The TORCHES are
being carried by several members of a small village. The VILLAGERS are
gathered behind a group of SIX POLICEMEN. The policemen are headed by
INSPECTOR ANGUS MACGOWAN, a plump, balding fellow, with a veiny,
bulbous nose, beady green eyes and a thick, curled red moustache.
MacGowan SHOUTS to Indy."|stage direction

8||"Indiana STRUGGLES a bit longer with the line. But his conscience
prevails and Indy DROPS the fishing pole. With a GRUMBLE, he ROWS back
to shore.
THE MOORS - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER
NIGHT has fallen. It is very DARK. A RELUCTANT Indiana has joined the
Inspector and the other Policemen. They LEAD the townspeople along the
foggy moors. Slowly, carefully, the villagers SEARCH... CREEPING...
their faces tense, many unable to hide their FEAR. A summer wind sends
an eeire HOWL whistling through the night air. Blue MOONLIGHT bathes
the moors, creating stark, frightening shadows.
An expression of ANGER and ANNOYANCE cover Indiana's face. He GRUMBLES
to MacGowan."|stage direction

than an angel's kiss!"|speech
15||"There is a sudden SCREAM! One of the villagers STUMBLES UPON
something. Everyone GATHERS around the villager.
A CORPSE lies before them. The body has a somewhat rubbery appearance,
as if all of its bones had been BROKEN. The man's pale, greenish face
is FROZEN in a hideous grimace. Indiana and MacGowan STARE in shock.
The villagers WHISPER among themselves."|stage direction

BEHIND her. A curious Indiana FOLLOWS.
The woman stops in a CLEARING. She is POINTING ahead. The villagers
SURROUND her. They STARE ahead, in the direction where the woman
points. Nearly a mile in the distance, WE SEE
AN ANCIENT SCOTTISH CASTLE.
An enormous, 16th CENTURY stone structure. Tall, forboding towers,
lined with menacing GARGOYLES, pierce the night sky. The castle
appears DESERTED. Its interior is completely DARK, save for a small,
flickering CANDLELIGHT. It burns from the castle's UPSTAIRS WINDOW.
Indiana gives a QUESTIONING look to MacGowan. The Inpector points to
the castle's upstairs window."|stage direction

murder's been committed."|speech

the castle)"|location

26||"The villagers STEP BACK. Eyes wide with FEAR. Murmers of 'Ain't goin'
in there', 'Nor I', 'Got me a wife and kids', are heard from the
TERRIFIED villagers. Indiana TURNS to MacGowan. Even the usually
sturdy Inspector is TREMBLING. But MacGowan turns to his men, FORCING
himself to be strong."|stage direction

RELUCTANTLY join the Inspector and Indiana, as they begin walking
TOWARD the castle. The remaining villagers and policemen STAY BEHIND.

neck. She STARES at the departing men."|stage direction

33||"THE CASTLE DOORS.
Two enormous wooden doors, covered with intricate CARVINGS of demons,
serpents and gargoyles, adorn the castle entrance. Indiana and the
police STAND before the doors. Indy GLANCES to the upstairs window.
The candle still FLICKERS.
A long, wooden bar, carved into the shape of a SERPENT, is fastened
through the metal door latches. It BLOCKS the castle entrance. Indy
and the Policemen GRAB HOLD of the bar. It is extremely HEAVY. Using
all of their strength, they manage to slide the bar OUT of the door
latches. It hits the ground with a THUD, rolling down the castle
stairs.
Indiana CLUTCHES the rusty, metal door handles. He PULLS. HARD. The
doors CREAK. GROAN. And slowly OPEN. A thick CLOUD OF DUST explodes
from inside of the castle. It BLOWS OUT all of the torches.
Behind the open doors, there is only TOTAL DARKNESS. Indiana ENTERS,
holding the flashlight before him. The Policemen exchange FRIGHTENED
glances. Inspector MacGowan SHOVES them through the open doors."|stage direction
34||INT. CASTLE|location
35||"Indy's flashlight BEAM glazes over the castle's interior. It is a
STONE PALACE. FILLED with elaborate, antique furnishings, macabre
sculptures and oil paintings. The place is bathed in DUST. Thick
COBWEBS fill each corner. It is extremely COLD. The men's breaths are
VISIBLE. Hennesey RUBS his folded arms."|stage direction
36|HENNESEY|"It's deathly cold in 'ere. How could
a human bein' survive?..."|speech
37||"Hearing this, the other Policemen exchange TERRIFIED glances. Indiana
shines his flashlight to a TWISTING, STONE STAIRCASE. The staircase
spirals upward along a far wall, leading to the SECOND FLOOR. A FAINT
GLIMMER of light emanates from the top of the stairs. Indiana moves
FORWARD. The Policemen FOLLOW.
Indiana ASCENDS the stairs. SLOWLY. SILENTLY. Toward the LIGHT.
MacGowan and the others are directly BEHIND Indy. As he makes his way
to the top, Indiana examines the bizarre OIL PAINTINGS that line the
wall. There are various PORTRAITS and LANDSCAPES, depicting everything
from MILITARY BATTLES to SUNDAY PICNICS. But the unsettling quality of
the pictures, is that they each feature the same white haired, ELDERLY
MAN. Indy COMMENTS to Mac."|stage direction

'e walks the moors every midnight...
others claim e's been dead for
years..."|speech
40||"Indy arrives at the TOP OF THE STAIRS. His hand rests on a SCULPTURE
that is part of the bannister. The sculpture is a bust of BARON
SEAGROVE. Indiana makes his way to the first doorway, where the LIGHT
emanates. The door is WIDE OPEN. A THICK COBWEB covers the entrance.
Indy WIPES away the web, and ENTERS the room. The Policemen DRAW their
pistols. They FOLLOW."|stage direction
41||INT. ROOM|location
42||"A BEDROOM. Deserted, except for a few pieces of elaborate, ancient
FURNITURE and a large CANOPY BED. Everything in the room is CAKED with
dust and cobwebs...save for the burning CANDLE. It RESTS on the
windowsill, in a sparkling, sterling silver holder. It bathes the room
in ORANGE LIGHT.
Indiana walks TOWARD the candle. Arm outstreched, he prepares to LIFT
it. The Policeman WATCH. SHIVERING. SILENT. Tightly gripping their
PISTOLS. Indy's fingers are INCHES from the candlestick. SUDDENLY...
There is a LOUD WHOOSH! The candle GOES OUT! Indiana DROPS his
flashlight. There is TOTAL DARKNESS. We hear the distant, MANICAL
LAUGH of a man. It ECHOES through the castle. Indy retrieves the
flashlight, clicking it back ON. The candle has DISAPPEARED! The laugh
has SOBSIDED.
MacGowan LOOKS at his men. A TROOBLED look covers the Inspector's
face. MacGowan's eyes DART about the room. Hennesy is GONE!"|stage direction

a CHILL through the men. Indiana DARTS out of the room. FOLLOWING the
sound. The Policemen are right BEHIND HIM."|stage direction
47||INT. CASTLE|location
48||"Indy and the Police HURRY down the stairs. The ringing bell CONTINUES.
MacGowan is CALLING for Hennesey. Indy DASHES to a door along the far
wall. He OPENS it. It leads into a DARK BASEMENT. The sound of the
ringing bell echoes from INSIDE. Indiana ENTERS, motioning for the
others to FOLLOW."|stage direction
49||INT. BASEMENT|location
50||"A decrepit, narrow, wooden STAIRWAY leads into the basement. Indy
holds tightly to his FLASHLIGHT. The Policemen are CLUSTERED behind
him, taking each step with extreme caution. The boards CREAK and GROAN
with their every move.
MacGowan LEANS to his side, calling for Hennesey. MacGowan's weight
causes the rotted bannister to SNAP IN TWO! He LOSES his footing!
FALLING off the side of the stairs! Indiana's arm SHOOTS OUT! GRABBING
HOLD of MacGowan's collar. Indy PULLS MacGowan back to SAFETY.
MacGowan CATCHES his breath. SHAKING."|stage direction
51|MACGOWAN|Thanks for catchin' me.|speech
52|INDIANA|I'd rather be catchin' trout.|speech
53||"They CONTINUE down the stairs, arrivifig at the bottom. It is a large,
MUSTY STONE BASEMENT. The slimy walls are covered with a GREEN MOSS.
There are several DOORS along the basement wall. The sound of the
ringing bell is much LOUDER down here.
Indiana moves to the FIRST DOOR. He REACHES for the handle. The
Policemen DRAW their pistols. Indy OPENS the door. A LARGE OBJECT
SHOOTS OUT FROM INSIDE! Rolling TOWARD the men! The policemen FIRE
their guns. SEVERAL SHOTS ring out. The object comes to a STOP. A DEEP
RED LIQUID pours out onto the floor. Indy DIPS his finger into the
liquid. He TASTES."|stage direction

60||"Everyone TURNS. A large STONE DOOR, built into the wall, slowly OPENS.
Indy and the police stare in AMAZEMENT. The door STOPS. Wide OPEN. A
FLICKERING LIGHT glimmers from inside. Indiana WALKS to the opening.
He PEERS into the opening. The Police stay a FEW STEPS behind.
BEHIND THE DOOR
A FAMILY CRYPT. Stone COFFINS, with glass covered tops, line the crypt
walls. Macabre, ghastly RELIGIOUS STATUES decorate the room. Countless
DEATH MASKS cover the ceiling, all carved with that same frighteningly
familiar face... BARON SEAGROVE!
CAMERA DOLLIES to the far corner of the crypt. It STOPS on a CLOSE-UP
of the CANDLESTICK! The EXACT candle from upstairs! Still BURNING! It
rests on one of the coffin's GLASS TOPS.
A TREMBLING MacGowan steps back, away from the crypt. Be BLURTS an
order to his men."|stage direction

very frightened Bottomley FOLLOWS."|stage direction
65||INT. CRYPT|location
66||"Indy's flashlight beam dances across the glass COFFIN TOPS. Decayed
CORPSES smile from inside, their hands tightly clutching crucifixes.
Bottomley is HORRIFIED by the sights. Indiana continues AHEAD. He
PASSES the burning candle, moving further into the darkness of the
crypt. The shivering Bottomley stays directly BEHIND Indy. With their
every step, the bell's ringing grows LOUDER... LOUDER...
Indiana and Bottomley arrive in a circular CHAMBER, located at the far
end of the crypt. Here, the ringing bell is nearly DEAFENING. The
sound echoes from ABOVE. We are on the floor of the BELL TOWER.
Indiana SHINES his flashlight UPWARD. The beam stops on a RINGING BELL
that hangs SEVERAL FEET in the air. Inside of the bell, dangling by
his feet, is the DEAD BODY of
HENNESEY! He has REPLACED THE BELL CLAPPER! His body SWINGS back and
forth. It SLAMS into the sides of the bell. Causing the DULL RINGING.
Bottomley SCREAMS. Indiana GRABS Bottomley's arm."|stage direction
67|INDIANA|Let's get outta' here.|speech
68||"Indy and Bottomley TURN to the crypt door. It begins to CLOSE! The two
men DASH FORWARD. The door CONTINUES to close. Indy and Bottomley are
only INCHES away...when the door SLAMS SHUT! They PUSH and KICK at the
door. NO GOOD. It WON'T BUDGE. A PANICKED Bottomley calls for help."|stage direction

77||"AGAIN, no answer. Indy SWEEPS the flashlight beam across the room. It
PASSES one of the coffins...then SHOOTS BACK! Indy is met with a
SHOCKING SIGHT!
BOTTOMLEY LIES INSIDE THE COFFIN! DEAD! His face twisted in a GHOULISH
SMILE. All of his bones BROKEN. His hands are wrapped around a
CRUCIFIX. Indy STARES in horror. There is a SOUND. FOOTSTEPS. There is
SOMEONE ELSE in here. Indy's flashlight beam DARTS around the crypt.
There is NO SIGN of anyone."|stage direction
78|INDIANA|Who is it?... Who's there?...|speech
79||"The same crazed LAUGH of a man echoes through the crypt. A CHILLED

his hand. His fingers are BURNT."|stage direction

Indy manages to GRAB HOLD of a stone coffin. His fingers tightly GRIP
the coffin's edge. Indiana LOOKS DOWN. Beneath him, is a SEVERAL
HUNDRED FOOT DROP INTO TOTAL DARKNESS!
Indy tries to PULL HIMSELF UP. The coffin's ancient stone begins to
CRUMBLE. Large chunks and pieces FALL from Indy's grasp. He is LOSING
HIS GRIP.
Seconds before he plummets into the abyss, Indiana REACHES inside of
the coffin. He clutches onto a CORPSE'S ARM! Using the arm, Indy
SWINGS DOWNWARD."|stage direction
87||INT. ABYSS|location
88||"At the precise moment, Indiana RELEASES the dead arm. He LANDS on a
ROCKY LEDGE. Located only a few feet BELOW the open crypt floor. Indy
STANDS on the ledge. SAFE. He SMILES. RELIEVED. Suddenly, the ledge
SNAPS!
Indiana FALLS! His body DROPS hundreds of feet into the blackness. A
MOMENT passes. Then... WE HEAR A SPLASH!
BOTTOM OF THE HOLE!
A POOL OF WATER! Surrounded by rocky, cavernous WALLS. Indiana's hat
FLOATS on the water's surface. Indy POPS OUT of the water, bobbing up
beside the hat. Indy REACHES for the hat. Suddenly, a FISH flaps out
of the water. The fish GOBBLES UP one of the hat's live baits and
disappears back underwater. Indy SMIRKS."|stage direction
89|INDIANA|NOW they bite!|speech
90||"Indy attempts to PULL himself out of the water. There is a LOUD SOUND.
Grinding METAL. Rattling CHAINS. Indy's eyes DART to his side.
TWO HORIZONTAL METAL GATES EJECT FROM THE CAVERN WALLS! They SHOOT
across the water! Like LIGHTNING! They're headed TOWARD each other...
and Indy's HEAD!
Indy DIVES underwater. THE GATES SNAP SHUT! Less than an INCH above
the water's surface! Indy ATTEMPTS to resurface. The closed gate STOPS
HIM. He CLUTCHES the grating, trying to MOVE the gate. It's TOO
STRONG! Indy STRUGGLES for air. NO GOOD. There isn't enough SPACE.
He's going to DROWN!
UNDERWATER
In desperation, Indy SWIMS downward. Looking for an ALTERNATE ESCAPE.
But there is NO BOTTOM in sight. Indy's eyes BULGE. His face loses
COLOR. Only a few precious SECONDS OF LIFE remain...when suddenly, he
SPOTS SOMETHING. A SMALL TUNNEL. Built into the CAVERN WALL. Indiana
hurriedly SWIMS to the tunnel. He BOLTS inside.
A WATER FOUNTAIN. A large, THREE TIERED stone structure. Instead of
the familiar carvings of angels and beautiful maidens, this fountain
is surrounded with water spewing DEMONS, GARGOYLES and hellish BEASTS.
CAMERA DOLLIES TO A LARGE METAL DRAIN, located inside of the
fountain's base. The drain cover begins to TURN. Suddenly FLIPPING
OPEN! Indiana CRAWLS out of the opening. He GULPS at the air. COLOR
returns to his face. LIFE returns to his body. Indy RISES to his feet.
He finds himself STANDING in the fountain.
INDY'S POV
He is inside of a BANQUET ROOM. The sprawling room is beautifully
DECORATED in Victorian dignity. The room is IMMACULATE. Not one SPECK
of dust. Two Medieval SUITS OF ARMOR adorn one wall. A gargantuan
crystal CHANDELIER hangs above a long, mahogany BANQUET TABLE.
At the far end of the table, sits a shriveled, white haired ELDERLY
MAN. It is BARON SEAMUS SEAGROVE III, the fellow whose likeness
appeared in every piece of artwork. Baron Seagrove is CALMLY eating
his dinner. A bloated ROASTED PIG rests on a silver platter before
him. The same candle we saw burning in the upstairs room and the
family crypt, now RESTS on the table. Directly BESIDE the Baron.
Two powerful, muscular MASTIFFS are tied to Baron Seagrove's chair.
Teeth BARED. Eyes AELAZE. The hounds FIGHT for a scrap of meat.
Indiana stares in BEWILDERMENT at the new surroundings. He STEPS OUT
of the fountain. Baron Seagrove seems UNAWARE of Indy's presense.
Indiana WALKS TOWARD the Baron."|stage direction
91|INDIANA|Excuse me, sir...? Hello...?|speech

95|INDIANA|"Listen, pal... There are two dead
Policemen upstairs and..."|speech
96||"The Mastiffs LEAP forward. COMING at Indiana. He tries to GET AWAY.
TOO SLOW. The hounds are UPON HIM. TEARING. CLAWING. BITING. They DRAG
Indy to the floor.
Baron Seagrove continues to ENJOY his dinner, seemingly OBLIVIOUS to
the scene before him.
Indiana FIGHTS for his life. The VICIOUS dogs tear at his clothing and
skin. Indy SPOTS something. On the wall ABOVE. Hanging amidst a
display of stuffed animal heads, is a HUNTER'S TRUMPET. Indy STRUGGLES
to his knees. Trying to REACH for the horn. But the dogs are still
BITING. CLAWING. WEAKENING Indiana.
Indy's fingers are INCHES from the horn. The Mastiffs' sharp claws RIP
at his arm. But Indy manages to SNATCH the trumpet. He quickly moves
the horn to his LIPS. He BLOWS. HARD. A HIGH, PIERCING NOTE fills the
air. The dogs respond to the SOUND. They HALT. STOPPING their attack.
For a MOMENT.
Tattered and bruised, Indiana LEAPS to his feet. He DROPS the horn. He
RUNS.
The Mastiffs come to their SENSES. They DART after Indy. Mouths
FOAMING.
Baron Seagrove continues to DINE, still IGNORING the action.
Indy runs to a VELVET CURTAIN. He GRABS HOLD of a long, thick rope
that is attached to the curtain. Indiana TEARS the curtain from the
wall. A large STAINED GLASS WINDOW is behind the curtain.
The FIRST MASTIFF leaps at Indy. Indiana quickly DRAPES the curtain
OVER the hound. Indy ties a large KNOT in the open curtain end. The
dog is TRAPPED.
Indy TURNS. The SECOND MASTIFF is only a FEW FEET AWAY. BARRELLING
toward Indy. Indiana HOPS to the window ledge. He OPENS the window.
The Mastiff LEAPS UPWARD! Indiana JUMPS OUT OF THE WINDOW! The dog
FOLLOWS Indy, also JUMPING OUT OF THE WINDOW!"|stage direction

104||"A SUIT OF ARMOR, located a few feet behind Indy, suddenly TWITCHES.
Its arm LOWERS. Its head slowly TURNS.
Indiana still walks TOWARD the Baron, who is only concerned with
spreading butter on his bread. Indy SHOUTS."|stage direction

107|INDIANA|I want some answers! Now!|speech
108||"There is a LOUD CREAK OF METAL. A huge, sharp BATTLE AXE SHOOTS INTO
FRAME! SWINGING toward Indy's head! Indiana SPINS. The axe is only
INCHES from his face. Indy LEAPS BACK. WHOOSH! The axe SLICES through
the air. JUST MISSING Indy. The shaken Indiana is SHOCKED to see
A GLISTENING, BLACK SUIT OF ARMOR! The black knight is nearly SEVEN
FEET TALL! It has COME TO LIFE and is walking TOWARD Indy. The black
knight is WILDLY swinging the battle axe. Indiana continues to STEP
BACK... BACK... Unbeknownst to Indy, his steps are leading him toward
ANOTHER SUIT OF ARMOR! Also over seven feet tall, this armor is made
of a SILVERY, WHITE METAL! As Indy moves CLOSER, the WHITE KNIGHT
OPENS ITS ARMS! When Indy is within reach, the white knight LOCKS its
powerful arms around Indy's chest! Indiana TRIES to break free. NO
GOOD. The white knight's grip is TOO TIGHT. Indy is TRAPPED!
The black knight still COMES TOWARD Indiana. Its frenzied axe SWINGS
back and forth. Indy still STRUGGLES with the white knight's bone
crunching grip.
The black knight is only a FEW FEET from Indy. Its deadly axe blade
INCHES from Indy's face. Indiana MOVES FAST. He JERKS his body
forward. This FLIPS the white knight off its feet! OVER Indy's head.
The white knight FLIES INTO the black knight. CRASH! This sends both
knights FALLING to the floor.
Indiana SHOOTS to his feet. The two knights LEAP to their feet. They
CHASE Indy. The black knight armed with his AXE, the white knight
armed with a long, sharp SWORD!
Baron Seagrove SPOONS another helping of boiled potatoes onto his
plate.
Indy snatches a SHIELD and SWORD from a nearby wall display. Ready to
FIGHT. The knights are UPON HIM. Indiana battles BOTH knights. He
DEFENDS the bludgeoning battle axe with his shield, and SWORDFIGHTS
the other knight! THRASH! CLANG! The sound of HEAVY METAL fills the
room!
Indy's sword STRIKES the white knight's thick chest. The sword SNAPS
IN TWO. In the confusion, Indy's shield is KNOCKED from his hand by
the powerful battle axe. Indy is DEFENSLESS.
The two metal giants RAISE their weapons. HIGH. AIMING for Indy's
head. The two knights SWING! Indy DIVES to the floor! The knights
CAN'T STOP their weapons in time... CRUNCH! They deliver a HARD BLOW
to each other! The woozy knights WOBBLE and SPIN. In a momentary DAZE.
Indiana JUMPS to his feet.
The BLACK KNIGHT hisses. FURIOUS. He DASHES after Indiana. The WHITE
KNIGHT is still REELING from the blow.
Seeing the black knight in HOT PURSUIT, Indy searches for a WEAPON. He
spots the curtain's long, thick ROPE. LYING on the floor.
The black knight is nearly UPON Indy. AXE RAISED! Indiana GRABS the
rope. He SPINS. FACING the knight. Indy SNAPS HIS WRIST! A LOUD CRACK!
The rope SHOOTS FORWARD! Not unlike Indiana's familiar WHIP!
The rope WRAPS itself around the black knight's neck. Indy JERKS the
whip forward. HARD. This sends the knight FLYING THROUGH THE AIR! The
knight crashes into the stone FOONTAIN! Several of the fountain's
sculptures SHATTER into pieces. The dazed, dented black knight
ATTEMPTS to stand...but LOSES his footing. The knight FALLS backward.
Into the fountain's WIDE DRAIN OPENING! Its HEAVY ARMOR causes the
knight to SINK. DISAPPEARING into the hole. Into the POOL OF WATER.
Indy CATCHES HIS BREATH. The white knight's SWORD SWINGS INTO FRAME!
SLICING through Indiana's jacket! Indy JUMPS BACK. The vicious white
knight COMES toward him.
Indiana TURNS to run. Finding himself at the BANQUET TABLE. Face to
face with the ROASTED PIG. A few feet away, Baron Seagrove CONTINUES
to dine. The white knight raises his sword ABOVE Indy. WHOOSH! The
sword begins to swing DOWN! Indiana DUCKS and DODGES the deadly blows.
Instead of carving Indiana, the knight's sword manages to SLICE
perfect sections of the roasted pig. The satisfied Baron HELPS HIMSELF
to a freshly carved slice of pork.
Indiana LEAPS onto the table top. Trying to ESCAPE the living suit of

holds the chandelier. The spinning plate SEVERS the rope. The
chandelier FLIES DOWNWARDl! CRASHING ON TOP of the white knight! The
knight lies BENEATH the chandelier. MOTIONLESS. The sword DROPS from
its lifeless hand. Onto the TABLE TOP.
Indy takes the knight's SWORD. Eyes on FIRE, sword OUTSTRETCHED,
Indiana WALKS across the table top. HEADED for Baron Seagrove.

charred body FALLS. FACE DOWN. ELECTROCUTED.
Indiana LEAPS TO HIS FEET. Suddenly remembering... THE FUSE! It is now
INCHES from the T.N.T. Indy can't get to it IN TIME. He GRABS his
whip. His arm SNAPS FORWARD. The whip CRACKS. It SLICES the remaining
fuse in two. The fuse FIZZLES and GOES OUT. The city is SAVED. Indy
SIGHS. There is a GUNSHOT! A BULLET whizzes by Indy's head. He TURNS.
MEPHISTO, bruised and bloodied from the jeep accident, stands SEVERAL
FEET AWAY. Mephisto's LUGER is aimed at Indy. Prepared to take ANOTHER

row of surrounding BELLS. The Nazi UNLATCHES the chain that holds all
of the bells in place. The bells begin to FALL. THUNDERING down the
coliseum stairs.
Indy COVERS his ears. The sound of countless CLANGING BELLS is nearly
deafening. He TURNS. Seeing the enormous bells ROLLING TOWARD HIM!
Indiana begins to RUN. GIANT ROLLING BELLS CHASE HIM FROM ALL
DIRECTIONS! Indy TWISTS...TURNS...LEAPS...in an effort to avoid being
CRUSHED by the heavy bells.
Mephisto WATCHES from above. SMILING.

DIRECTLY OVER the pit.
But Indiana is SAFE. There is a FIVE INCH DROP from the ground, to the
pit's OVERHEAD METAL BARS. Indy LIES on the bars. SAFELY above the
countless TIGERS.
The bells have all COME TO A STOP. They LIE around the coliseum
ground. STILL. Only one bell GENTLY ROCKS. It slowly TEETERS on the
coliseum stairs. It HASN'T yet rolled off.
Indiana begins to CLIMB OUT out of the pit, when suddenly... ANOTHER
GUNSHOT RINGS OUT. Indy is HIT. In the CHEST. He SLIPS. FALLS. Bis
wounded body is SPRAWLED on the bars. TEETERING. Ready to FALL into
the waiting tigers.
Mephisto's luger is SMOKING. The Nazi WALKS down the coliseum stairs.
He moves TOWARD Indiana. Seeing Mephisto heading for him... Indiana
REMOVES his gun. He AIMS at the Nazi. But Indy's vision is BLURRED.
His hand TREMBLES. Mephisto's silhouette nears... But the bullet ZIPS
PAST Mephisto and STRIKES a section of wood below the teetering bell.
This causes the bell to FALL...and slowly ROLL forward.
Mephisto ARRIVES at the edge of the Tiger Pit. He is about to shoot
Indy...then comes upon ANOTHER IDEA. Mephisto LOWERS the luger. He
gives a SWIFT KICK to Indy's ribs. Indiana FALLS THROUGH the bars. His
arm SHOOTS OUT. With his last bit of strength, Indy's hand GRABS HOLD
of a bar. CLUTCHING on for dear life. His body DANGLES over the
tigers. They SNAP at his legs. HUNGRY. GROWLING. Mephisto SMILES. He
STEPS on Indy's fingers. GRINDING them beneath his boot heel. Indy
CRIES OUT... He's going to FALL...
Mephisto PAUSES. He HEARS something behind him. A CLANGING BELL.
Getting CLOSER. LOUDER. Mephisto TURNS. He sees the GIANT BELL. COMING
at him. Only INCHES AWAY. There is NO TIME to move. The bell ROLLS
OVER MEPHISTO. KNOCKING him INTO THE PIT.
Mephisto FALLS through the bars. INSIDE the pit. INTO the middle of
the hungry tigers. Mephisto SCREAMS. The tigers are UPON HIM. The Nazi
is RIPPED TO SHREDS. Within seconds, his screams are a MEMORY.
A very WEAK Indiana still clutches the bar. He manages to BOOST
