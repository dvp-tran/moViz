YOUNG MAN
Fresh-faced, eager -- NORVILLE BARNES. He is gazing off at:
WESSELS EMPLOYMENT AGENCY
The sign is over a ground floor office; an exterior clock
shows 9:00. A curtain is just being pulled open in its picture
window to reveal a great job board. It is like the departures
board in a great train station, with each of its individual
entries flipping over occasionally to reveal a new
opportunity. On offer are jobs like: PASTRY CHEF, STEAMFITTER,
LAY-OUT MAN, GRAVEDIGGER, etc.
REVERSE
On the small crowd gathered to, like Norville, watch the
board -- men in search of jobs, of various classes and
vocations, but alike in their intent gaze, their hands dug
into their pockets, their hats pushed back on their heads,
bobbing occasionally to get a better view of the chattering
board. Men occasionally head for the office as they see a
prospect they like.
Norville stands pat, watching.
HIS POV
An entry flips over to reveal EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT.
NORVILLE
He brightens.
BOARD
We PAN ALONG the executive entry to EXPERIENCE REQUIRED.
NORVILLE
He frowns.
Around him, the crowd is thinning out as men trot in to apply
for their respective jobs.
We see other entries: JUNIOR EXECUTIVE. PAN TO EXPERIENCE
ONLY. EXECUTIVE MANAGER... MUST HAVE EXPERIENCE.
BUSINESSMAN... EXPERIENCED.

WIDER
Norville, sitting at a coffeeshop counter, sets the pencil
down. His chin is sunk disconsolately into his palm.
His hat is pushed back dejectedly on his head. He idly stirs
his coffee with his spoon.
He takes one last gulp of the coffee, then sets the cup down
on the want ads, stands, and digs into his pocket for change,
turning it inside-out.
CLOSE ON COUNTER
As Norville puts all his change on the counter. His hand
hesitates; he takes a little of it back. He LEAVES FRAME.
A waitress's hand ENTERS from the far side of the counter.
She clears away the saucer, then the cup -- which has been
resting on the want ads. It leaves a perfect brown circle

A sheet of newspaper eddies INTO FRAME. The wind tosses it

The newspaper eddies around some more, then plasters against

He peels it off and is about to toss it away but stops,
noticing something.

He swings his chair out.
He steps up onto the chair.
The board stares.
He steps up from the chair onto the board table.
The heads of the board members swing up in unison.
Hudsucker is FRAMED FROM MID-TORSO DOWN. He shakes the tension

a huge clock capping its facade. Above the clock is the

FLOATING IN TOWARDS the shattered board room window.
The woman's SCREAM on the street below is FAINT, ECHOING,
MIXING INTO the sound of an APPROACHING SIREN.
THROUGH the window we see the BOARD MEMBERS still sitting
around the table, paralyzed in attitudes of horror and
disbelief. All stare at the shattered window in the f.g.
At the far end of the table, Hudsucker's chair is empty and
oddly askew. His cigar still smokes in its ashtray.
There are dust footprints down the middle of the long oak
table.
One Executive sits with a pluming cigarette held halfway to
his mouth; another holds a carafe suspended on its way to
his water glass; another holds his spectacles inches from
his nose.
We hear only the HUM of the HUDSUCKER CLOCK.
SID MUSSBURGER ENTERS FRAME at the window. He is a tall middle-
aged executive with lean and rugged good looks and a
commanding presence.
He knocks a last piece of glass out of the sill with his
knuckle, looks out, grunts, and draws his head back in.
The CAMERA FOLLOWS him INTO the room. The other board members'
heads swivel to watch him, all staring, searching desperately
for some hint as to the fate of their fallen leader.
Apparently, some absurd hope still lingers.
Mussburger perches on the board table by his own chair.

ashtray."|stage direction

The subhead reads: Stockholders Wary. The sub-subhead reads:
Meteoric Rise From Mailroom.
The article is under the byline of Amy Archer.
CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that we are looking at the
newspaper OVER someone's SHOULDER. The person swivels around
and away -- his face now TO us, we see that it is Norville
looking at the newspaper. He throws his head back and laughs
merrily.
As he laughs -- thwock -- a steaming towel is thrown onto
his face and he continues to swivel. CONTINUED PULL BACK
REVEALS that he is in a barber chair.
His head drops back and OUT OF FRAME as the swiveling chair
is cranked down, but immediately -- still spinning --
-- his head reappears as the chair is cranked up again.
Still laughing, Norville is now freshly shaven and has a
slicked-back haircut, heavy with pomade.
FREEZE ON Norville's laughing face.

PULL BACK to reveal it is another front page photo next to
the headline: Hud Board To Street: GIVE MAN FROM MUNCIE A
CHANCE. Subhead: Has Fresh Ideas.
CONTINUED PULL BACK REVEALS that the paper is lying on a
chair. Norville's mailroom apron is tossed onto the chair to
cover it.
PAN TO where the apron was tossed from. Norville stands on a
tailor's stage, laughing, as the tailor, also laughing, takes
his measurements. Norville in shirtsleeves, boxer shorts,
hose stockings and garters.
The tailor rises, laughing merrily, throwing up his arms and
spreading them wide with hands stretching the measuring tape.
Norville laughs merrily and also throws his arms up wide.
BOARD MEMBER
laughs merrily, his arms thrown wide, tickertape stretching
between his hands. He joyously tosses away the tickertape.

PAN UP to reveal that the tickertape continues to burp its
disastrous tale of good news for the board.
PAN UP FURTHER to reveal that the machine is in Mussburger's
office. At the far end of the room, behind his desk,
Mussburger laughs as he looks at a newspaper.
TRACK IN TOWARDS him.
On his desk the perpetual ballbearings swing; outside his
window the sweep second hand of the Hudsucker clock rumbles
by, sweeping a shadow across the floor. Evil prevails.
As Mussburger opens the newspaper, the CONTINUED TRACK IN
shows its front page headline: HUD STOCK DIPS. Subhead: Just
Good Is He?
TRACK IN ON the front page photo: Norville laughing, his
chin propped in his hand.
PHOTOGRAPH
COMES TO LIFE and Norville unfreezes, laughing.
We are now TRACKING BACK FROM him. He sits behind a huge oak
desk, newly coifed and tailored.
The brass plaque on the desk confirms that he is in the OFFICE
OF THE PRESIDENT.
TRACK BACK CONTINUES THROUGH the large elegant office, leaving
Norville looking quite small IN LONG SHOT.
His LAUGHTER ECHOES in the bright bare office.
Norville's laughter is just winding down, leaving him
exhausted, as if he has been laughing nonstop for several
days. He finally sighs and wipes a tear from his eye."|stage direction

1526|NORVILLE|"'Many years, uh... I know that you
will be wondering why I have decided
to move on, ending my tenure at
Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You
will be thinking, Why now, when things
are going so well? Granted, from the
standpoint of our balance sheet and
financials, sure, sure, we're doing
fine. However, Sid. These things
have long since ceased to give me
pleasure. I look at myself now and
no longer see the idealistic young
man who started this company. Now I
see only an empty shell whom others
call a 'success.' How has this come
to pass? When and why did I trade
all of my hopes, dreams and
aspirations, for the emptiness of
power and wealth? What the heck have
I done?"|speech

then pats down a yawn."|stage direction

that I allowed time and age to corrupt
my dreams. Instead of fiercely
guarding what was timeless inside of
myself, I let the hubbub of earthly
commerce erode my character, and
dissolve my better self. How is it
that some manage to preserve
themselves where I have failed?
Sidney, I do not know. Perhaps if
others love you, you may more securely
love yourself -- but I am alone. I
loved a woman once, Sid, as you well
know -- a beautiful, vibrant lady,
an angel who in her wisdom saw fit
to choose you instead of I...'"|speech

We have made our compromises with

Accordingly, in the spirit of hope,
and the ringing in of the new, I
hereby bequeath my entire interest
in the company, and my seat on the
board, to whomever is Hudsucker's
most recent employee at the time of
my demise. I know this will disappoint
