A small GROUP OF DIGNITARIES waits to welcome the Senator. One of the members of the group os a well dressed JAR JAR BINKS, a member of the Galactic Representative Commission, and DORME, Senator Amidala's handmaiden.
One of the FIGHTER PILOTS jumps from the wing of his ship and removes his helmet. He is CAPTAIN TYPHO, SENATOR AMIDALA'S Security Officer. He moves over to a WOMAN PILOT.
CAPTAIN TYPHO
We made it. I guess I was wrong,
there was no danger at all.
The ramp ;pwers. TWO NABOO GUARDS appear. SENATOR AMIDALA, ONE HANDMAIDEN (VERSE) and FOUR TROOPERS descend the ramp. AMIDALA is more beautiful now than she was ten years earlier when, as Queen, she was freeing her people from the yoke of the Trade Federation.
The DIGNITARIES start to move forward. SENATOR AMIDALA reaches the foot of the ramp, when suddenly there is a blinding FLASH and a huge EXPLOSION. The DIGNITARIES and PILOTS are hurled to the ground as the starship is destroyed.
Klaxons blare, alarms sound! CAPTAIN TYPHO and the TWO ESCORT PILOTS get up and run to where SENATOR AMIDALA lies dying. Beyond, ARTOO DETOO drops down from the Naboo Fighter and rolls toward the wreckage. The FEMALE ESCORT PILOT kneels by SENATOR AMIDALA and takes off her helmet, revealing SENATOR PADME AMIDALA."|stage direction

Amidala of the Naboo system... Has
been assassinated!"|speech

26|"PALPATINE
(continued)"|"This grievous blow is especially
personal to me. Before I became
Chancellor, I served Amidala when
she was Queen. She was a great
leader who fought for justice, not
only in this honourable assembly,
but also on her home planet. She
was so loved she could have been
elected queen for life. She
believed in public service, and
she fervently believed in
democracy. Her death is a great
loss to us all. We will all mourn

freedom... and as a dear friend."|speech

37|PALPATINE|"It is with great surprise and
joy the chair recognises the
Senator from Naboo, Padmé Amidala."|speech
38|PADMÉ|"Less than an hour ago, an
assassination attempt was made
against my life. One of my
bodyguards and six  others were
ruthlessly and senselessly
murdered. I was the target but,
more importantly, I believe this
security measure before you, was
the target. I have led the
opposition to build an army... but
there is someone in this body who
will stop at nothing to assure it's
passage..."|speech
39||Many of the SENATORS boo and yell at SENATOR AMIDALA.|stage direction

41|PADMÉ|"I warn you, if you vote to create
this army, war will follow. I
have experienced the misery of war
first-hand; I do not wish to do it
again."|speech
42||There is sporadic yelling for and against her statements.|stage direction
43|PADMÉ|"Wake up, Senators... you must wake
up! If you offer the separatists
violence, they can only show us
violence in return! Many will
lose their lives. All will lose
their freedom. This decision
could very well destroy the very
foundation of our great Republic.
I pray you do not let fear push
you into a disastrous decision.
Vote down this security measure,
which is nothing less than a
declaration of war! Does anyone
here want that? I cannot believe
they do."|speech
44||There is an undercurrent of booing... and groaning. SENATOR ORN FREE TAA moves his pod next to AMIDALA.|stage direction
45|ORN FREE TAA|"My motion to defer the vote must
be dealt with first. That is the
rule of law."|speech
46||AMIDALA looks angry and frustrated. PALPATINE gives her a sympathetic look.|stage direction

disgruntled spice miners, on

think that Count Dooku was behind
it."|speech
71||There is a stir of surprise.|stage direction
72|MACE WINDU|"You know, M'Lady, Count Dooku
was once a Jedi. He wouldn't
assassinate anyone, it is not in
his character."|speech
73|KI-ADI-MUNDI|"He is a political idealist, not
a murderer."|speech

Senator, in grave danger you are."|speech
75||PALPATINE gets up, walks to the window, and looks out at the vast city.|stage direction
76|PALPATINE|"Count Dooku has always avoided
any kind of conflict. It appears
he has no desire to start a war.
Why would he kill you? To what end?"|speech

being tells me he was behind it..."|speech

Mace."|stage direction

the Senator be placed under the
protection of your graces."|speech

of manpower during these stressful

do not believe the..."|speech

No, but I do, Senator."|speech
83|PADMÉ|"Chancellor, please! I don't want
any more guards!"|speech
84|PALPATINE|"I realise all too well that
additional security might be
disruptive for you, but perhaps
someone you are familiar with... an
old friend like... Master Kenobi..."|speech
85||PALPATINE nods to MACE WINDU, who nods back.|stage direction
86|MACE WINDU|"That's possible. He has just
returned from a Border dispute on
Ansion."|speech
87|PALPATINE|"You must remember him, M'Lady...
he watched over you during the
blockade conflict."|speech
88|PADMÉ|This is not necessary, Chancellor.|speech
89|PALPATINE|"Do it for me, M'Lady, please. I
will rest easier. We had a big
scare today. The thought of
losing you is unbearable."|speech

91|MACE WINDU|"I will have Obi-Wan report to you
immediately, M'Lady."|speech
92||YODA leans into her ear.|stage direction

Senator, not to start an
investigation."|speech

kill you Padmé, I promise you."|speech

mandate, my young Padawan learner."|speech
132|ANAKIN|"I meant in the interest of
protecting her, Master, of course."|speech

exercise again, Anakin. You will
pay attention to my lead."|speech
134|ANAKIN|Why?|speech
135|OBI-WAN|What??!!|speech
136|ANAKIN|"Why else do you think we were
assigned to her, if not to find
the killer? Protection is a job
for local security... not Jedi.
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our
mandate."|speech
137|OBI-WAN|"We will do as the Council has
instructed, and you will learn
your place, young one."|speech
138|PADMÉ|"Perhaps with merely your presence,
the mysteries surrounding this

apprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!"|speech

flying, Master."|speech

what you're doing is suicide!"|speech

good at this."|speech

guy's gonna kill himself any
minute now!"|speech
231||ZAM WESSEL turns into oncoming traffic, deliberately trying to throw the JEDI off. Oncoming speeders swerve, trying to avoid ZAM and the JEDI. ZAM does a quick, tight loop-over and ends up behind the JEDI. She is now in a much better position to fire at them with her laser pistol. To avoid being hit by the laser bolts, ANAKIN slams on the brakes and moves alongside ZAM. She now fires point-blank at OBI-WAN.|stage direction
232|OBI-WAN|"What are you doing? He's gonna
blast me!"|speech
233|ANAKIN|Right - this isn't working.|speech
234||ANAKIN slides underneath Zam's speeder. They race along in traffic, one speeder right on top of the other. The BOUNTY HUNTER skims over the rooftops, causing ANAKIN to drop behind. ANAKIN goes through his gears, zooming around traffic. They race at high speed across a wide, flat surface of the city planet. A large spacecraft almost collides with them as it attempts to land. They round a corner and clip a flag, which gets caught on one of the front air scoops.|stage direction
235|OBI-WAN|That was too close!|speech

238|ANAKIN|"Clear the flag! We're losing
power! Hurry!"|speech

240|OBI-WAN|"Whooooaaa! Don't do that! I
don't  like it when you do that!"|speech
241|ANAKIN|So sorry, Master.|speech

(continuing)"|Ahh, damn.|speech
251|OBI-WAN|Stop!!|speech
252|ANAKIN|No, we can make it.|speech
253||ANAKIN barely misses the BOUNTY HUNTER'S speeder as he dives under it, and through a small gap in the building hitting several pipes and going wildly out of control. ANAKIN struggles to regain control of the speeder, narrowly missing a crane, barely clipping a pair of giant struts. A giant gasball shoots up, causing ANAKIN to spin and bump a building, stalling the speeder.|stage direction
254|OBI-WAN|"I'm crazy... I'm crazy... I'm
crazy."|speech
255|ANAKIN|But it worked... we made it.|speech

263|ANAKIN|No we didnt...|speech
264||Out of a cloud of smoke and ball of flames the JEDI tear after ZAM. They are smoking. OBI-WAN slaps out the small fire on the dashboard. ZAM goes up and down, through cross-traffic. There is a near miss as a speeder almost hits them. ZAM turns down and left between two buildings. ANAKIN pulls up and to the right|stage direction
265|OBI-WAN|"Where are you going?! He went
down there, the other way."|speech
266|ANAKIN|This is a shortcut... I think.|speech
267|OBI-WAN|"What do you mean, You think?
What kind of shortcut?! He went
completely the other way! Youve
lost him!"|speech
268|ANAKIN|"Master, if we keep this chase
going, that creeps gonna end up
deep fried. Personally, Id very
much like to find out who in the
hell he is and who hes working
for..."|speech
269|"OBI-WAN
(sarcastic)"|"Oh, so thats why were going in
the wrong direction."|speech
270||ANAKIN turns up a side street, zooming up several small passageways, then stops, hovering about fifty stories up.|stage direction
271|"OBI-WAN
(continuing)"|Well, you lost him.|speech
272|ANAKIN|Im deeply sorry, Master.|speech
273||"ANAKIN looks around front and back. He spots something. He seems to
start counting to himself as he watches something below approach."|stage direction
274|"ANAKIN
(continuing)"|Excuse me for a moment.|speech
275||"ANAKIN jumps out of the speeder. OBI-WAN looks down and sees Zams speeder about five stories below them cruising past. ANAKIN miraculously lands on top of the Bounty Hunters speeder. The speeder wobbles under the impact. ZAM looks up and realises what has happened.
ZAM takes off, and ANAKIN slides to the back strut and almost slips off, but manages to hang on. ANAKIN works his way back to the speeders cockpit, just as ZAM stops suddenly, and ANAKIN flies forward to the left front fork. ZAM shoots at him with a laser pistol. There is a BLAST near ANAKIN'S hand, which breaks off a piece of the speeder. ANAKIN slides to the right fork of the speeder, where ZAM cant reach him. He scrambles to the top, holding onto an air scoop.
OBI-WAN has jumped into the drivers seat of his speeder and is deftly gaining on the rogue speeder. The two speeders dive through oncoming traffic and then through cross traffic. Finally, ANAKIN is able to get hold of his lightsaber and starts to cut his way through the roof of the speeder. ZAM takes out her laser pistol and starts firing at the helpless JEDI, knocking the sword out of his hand. OBI-WAN races under the speeder and catches the Jedi weapon in the passengers seat.
ANAKIN sticks his hand into the cockpit and, using the Force, pulls the gun out of ZAMS hand. She grabs the Jedis hand, and they struggle for the weapon. It goes off, blowing a hole in the floor of the speeder. The speeder careens wildly out of control. ZAM struggles to pull the speeder out of its nose dive. OBI-WAN gets slowed down by traffic and loses sight of the Bounty Hunters speeder.
Just as the dragster is about to nose dive into the ground, ZAM pulls it out, and it slides hard on the pavement in a shower of sparks. ANAKIN goes flying into the street."|stage direction

277||"ZAM exits the crashed speeder and runs. ANAKIN picks himself up off the pavement and runs down the very crowded street.
It's the seedy underbelly of the city. Broken sidewalks, garish lights reflected on the filthy puddles. It's pretty crowded with various ALIEN LOW-LIFES, PANHANDLING DROIDS, and the occasional group of UPPERCLASS SLUMMERS.
ANAKIN barges into several of them as he chases after the fleeing ZAM. He loses the Bounty Hunter in the crowd, them sees him again. The young Jedi is having a very difficult time getting through the crowd.
Ahead, ZAM turns in through a door and disappears.
A nightclub sighs is flashing over the door. ANAKIN is just about to follow ZAM when there is a sudden swirl of litter from downthrusters. PEOPLE start moving out of the way, and the open speeder lands in the street beside him. OBI-WAN gets out and walks over, holding out ANAKIN'S lightsaber."|stage direction

The drink is poured. OBI-WAN reaches for it. The gun is raised to aim directly at his back, and suddenly OBI-WAN turns fast. His lightsaber flashes. There is a shrill SCREAM and ZAM'S ARM hits the floor. The gun drops from its twitching fingers. Blood spreads.

training, I was very homesick and
very lonely. This city and my Mom
were the only pleasant things I
had to think about... The problem
was, the more I thought about my
Mom, the worse I felt. But I
would feel better if I thought
about the palace - the way it
shimmers in the sunlight - the way
the air always smells of flowers..."|speech

distant waterfalls. The first
time I saw the Capital, I was very
young... I'd never seen a
waterfall before. I though they

power and politics when you were
a little girl?"|speech

(laughing)"|"No! That was the last thing I
thought of. My dream was to help
in the ""Refugee Relief Movement.""
I never thought of running for
elected office. But the more
history I studied, the more I
realised how much good politicians
could do. So when I was eight, I
joined the ""Apprentice
Legislators"", then later on became
a Senatorial advisor, with such a
passion that, before I knew it, I
was elected Queen. Partly because
I scored so high on my education
certificate, but for the most part
it was my conviction that reform
was possible. I wasn't the
youngest Queen ever elected, but
now that I think back on it, I'm
not sure I was old enough. I'm not
sure I was ready."|speech

did a good job. I heard they
tried to amend the Constitution so
you could stay in office."|speech
519|PADMÉ|"Popular rule is not democracy,
Annie. It gives the people what
they want, not what they need.
And, truthfully, I was relieved
when my two terms were up. So
were my parents. They worried
About me during the blockade and
couldn't wait for it all to be
over. Actually, I was hoping to
have a family by now... My
sisters have the most amazing,
wonderful kids... but when the
Queen asked me to serve as
Senator, I couldn't refuse her."|speech

Her Highness could have made."|speech

Dooku and the separatists?"|speech

leaving the Republic every day.
If the Senate votes to create an
army, I'm sure it's going to push
us into a civil war."|speech

been a full-scale war since the
formation of the Republic!"|speech
532|QUEEN JAMILLIA|"Do you see any way, through
negotiations, to bring the
separatists back into the Republic?"|speech
533|PADMÉ|"Not if they feel threatened. The
separatists don't have an army,
but if they are provoked, they
will move to defend themselves.
I'm sure of that. And with no time
or money to build an army, my
guess is they will turn to the
Commerce Guilds or the Trade
Federation for help."|speech

Nothing been done in the Senate

Chancellor's best efforts, there
are still many bureaucrats,
judges, and even Senators on the
payrolls of the Guilds."|speech

those hearings, and the four trials in
the Supreme Court, Nute Gunray is
still the Viceroy of the Trade
Federation. Do those money
mongers control everything?"|speech

lost faith in the Republic. He
believed that politics were
corrupt, and he felt the Jedi

round the map reader, younglings.
Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet.
Find it, we will try..."|speech

OBI-WAN walks into the display.|stage direction

but it isnt. Gravity is pulling
all the stars in this area inward
to this spot. There should be a
star here... but there isnt."|speech

silhouette remains, but the star
and all its planets have
disappeared. How can this be?"|speech

erased information from the

JANGO FETT draws his gun and fires at the charging JEDI. OBI-WAN deflects the blast and swings at JANGO FETT.
The bounty hunter rockets up and over OBI-WAN, landing behind him. He fires a thin wire from his wrist pack, trying to entangle the Jedi.
JANGO FETT fire several Kamino Kyber Darts from his elbow launcher. OBI-WAN deflects them back at JANGO FETT, but they strike harmlessly against the bounty hunter's armour.
IN THE COCKPIT of Jango Fett's ship, BOBA FETT grabs the controls of a laser gun and swings it to aim at OBI-WAN.
OUTSIDE, in the driving rain, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT circle each other, sizing each other up - feinting.
IN THE COCKPIT, each time BOBA FETT is ready to fire, JANGO FETT blocks his view of OBI-WAN.
OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN makes a sudden attack, swinging at JANGO FETT, who deflects the blows. One slices off a piece of the bounty hunter's shoulder plate. JANGO FETT rockets into the air and hovers above OBI-WAN. The Jedi spins as:
IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT fires.
OUTSIDE, the laser shell streaks past OBI-WAN to strike the edge of the tower. JANGO FETT fires down at OBI-WAN. The Jedi deflects the shots back, but JANGO FETT evades them. Then he swoops down, swinging around OBI-WAN. As he shoots past, he kicks the lightsaber out of the Jedi's hand.
The lightsaber skids across the wet surface of the landing platform. OBI-WAN dives after it. JANGO FETT zooms in front of him and grabs the lightsaber. OBI-WAN punches it out of his hand.
IN THE COCKPIT, BOBA FETT watches as:
OUTSIDE, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT grapple and fight, punching, kicking, grabbing hold, and throwing each other around. OBI-WAN grabs JANGO FETT tightly, and JANGO FETT rockets up into the air and kicks OBI-WAN loose. OBI-WAN crashes to the deck and slides toward the edge. He grapples desperately for a handhold on the slick surface.
JANGO FETT rockets down to kick at him. OBI-WAN hauls himself up. JANGO FETT zooms to the far side of the platform.
OBI-WAN uses Jedi powers to pull part of the structure loose. It hits JANGO FETT, who loses his balance, teetering on the edge. OBI-WAN charges acress, dives, and grabs hold of JANGO FETT just as he falls over the edge.
Locked together, OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT plummet down toward the raging ocean. At the last moment, JANGO FETT fires a cable out of his backpack that shoots upward and locks onto a metal strut on the underside of the platform. OBI-WAN and JANGO FETT swing and CRASH onto one of the stilts.
OBI-WAN is knocked clear and drops onto a SMALL SERVICE PLATFORM just above the waves. He hauls himself to his feet. JANGO FETT hovers in mid-air opposite him, as a HUGE WAVE crashes over OBI-WAN. When it subsides, the Jedi has disappeared.
JANGO FETT rockets up to the landing platform, where he drops down beside his ship. He clambers inside the cockpit and settles into the pilot's seat. He punches buttons. The engines ROAR.
OUTSIDE, Jango Fett's ship lifts off from the platform and heads up into the lowering sky. It disappears. Lightning flashes. Rain lashes the tower and streams across the surface of the platform, to where:

ANAKIN's REEK starts to buck. It charges around the arena with ANAKIN hanging on for dear life. He whirls the free length of chain around his head and casts it into the REEK's mouth. Its jaws clamp hard on the chain. ANAKIN yanks hard on the chain, turning the REEK, beginning to ride it.
The NEXU's claws dig deep into the post. The cat-like creature reaches the top of the post and takes a swipe at PADME. She turns and the claw barely catches her shirt ripping it off, leaving superficial claw marks across her back. She hits the creature with her chain and it backs off down the pole. Then, PADME jumps off the post into the air. She swings around on the chain and whacks the beast hard on the head with both her feet. It tumbles back onto the sand.
