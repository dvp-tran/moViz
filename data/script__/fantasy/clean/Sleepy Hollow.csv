INSERT TITLE:"|stage direction||
5||1799 Sleepy Hollow, New York|unknown||
6||"THUNDEROUS HOOFBEATS are HEARD behind.
The ugly man glances back again.  His lantern swings wild...
SHATTERS against a tree.  The jammed-up pole SLAMS the ugly
man off his horse...
He hits the ground.  He runs, trips, falls and scrambles up.
DEEP IN THE FOREST, we glimpse the source of the HOOFBEATS: a
HUGE FORM on a HUGE BLACK HORSE, already gone.
The ugly man pushes through thorny bushes.  Jagged branches
slit his hands and cheeks.
He bursts from the briar patch and tumbles to a trail.  He
lifts his bloodied face.  He runs.
IN THE FOREST BEHIND: the hooves of the black horse rip
underbrush.  HOOFBEATS DEAFENING.  A spur digs into the
snorting steed's already bleeding flank.
The pursuer's gloved hand draws a SWORD, blade RINGING.
ON THE TRAIL, the ugly man runs on.  The shrill WHISTLE of a
SWORD SWING is HEARD as the pursuer blurs past.
The ugly man is still running when his head lolls back, at an
impossible angle... tumbles off his shoulders... His headless
body hits the dirt."|stage direction||

Daredevil picks up speed...
Daredevil leaps just as a lightning bolt blasts down,
striking the Horseman.

Silence and smoke.  At the tree, Lady Van Tassel's hand
sticks out from the tight-shut suture.
The sewn wound on her palm seeps blood."|stage direction||
