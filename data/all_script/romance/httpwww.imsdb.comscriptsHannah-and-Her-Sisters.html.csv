Woody Allen"|unknown
1||"As the last credit appears, the song ends in a crescendo and
the screen fades to total black.
Immediately, a new melody begins, an uptempo jazz number, as
a title appears on the screen."|location

CUT TO:"|unknown
3||"INT. HANNAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
A full face of Lee, wearing a gray sweater and leaning
against the dining room doorway.  She gazes into the camera
with a half-smile on her face as Elliot speaks over the
screen."|location
4||God, she's beautiful.|stage direction
5||"Lee glances over her shoulder, then turns from the doorway
and walks away.  The camera follows her, moving across a
book-and-photograph-filled bookshelf that obscures her from
view as she walks into a crowded, comfortable vestibule.
People, some holding drinks, some just entering the
apartment, surround her.  Everyone is talking at once,
carrying on easy, familiar conversation."|location
6||"She's got the prettiest eyes, and
she looks so sexy in that sweater."|stage direction
7||Lee smiles at the various people, exchanging greetings.|location
8||Hi, how are you?|stage direction
9||"Two more guests enter the apartment; the vestibule is full
now.  Still walking, Lee lightly hugs one of the children as
she continues on her way towards the living room.  Elliot's
voice, as well as the jazzy music, is heard."|location
10||"I just want to be alone with her
and hold her and kiss her..."|stage direction
11||"Lee walks into the living room, turning her head back for a
moment to talk to the child she has just hugged."|location
12||"...and tell her how much I love her
and take care of her.  Stop it, you
idiot.  She's your wife's sister.
But I can't help it."|stage direction
13||"The camera is still moving with Lee as she smiles and stops
to chat with her mother.  Elliot's voice, as well as the
music, continues over the low din of warm conversation."|location
14||"I'm consumed by her.  It's been
months now.  I dream about her.  I-
I, I think about her at the office.
Oh, Lee."|stage direction
15|ELLIOT (V.O.)|(sighing)|speech
16||What am I gonna do?|stage direction
17||"Lee starts to walk off again, finishing her conversation
with her mother.  She passes several other guests, then
turns to greet April, giving her a warm, brief hug."|location
18||"I hear myself mooning over you, and
it's disgusting.  Before, when she..."|stage direction
19||"Elliot's voice-over continues as he is actually seen,
standing in a doorway having a conversation with a gesturing,
rotund man.  Both are holding drinks as Lee, carrying a tray
of hors d'oeuvres and two drinks, walks between them.  The
space is very tight; the men hold up their drinks to make
room for her."|location
20||"...squeezed past me in the doorway,
and I smelled that perfume on the
back of her neck..."|stage direction
21||"Elliot watches Lee walk off; the other man, oblivious,
continues to talk.  Elliot reluctantly returns to the
conversation, but he can't help turning his head to gaze at
the offscreen Lee as the other man chatters on."|location
22||"...Jesus, I, I thought I was gonna
swoon!  Easy..."|stage direction
23||"The camera resumes following a smiling Lee.  She has just
put down the tray and drinks near April, and briskly and
obliviously, she walks past a doorway where Elliot, still
ruminating, watches her, entranced."|location
24||"You're a dignified financial
advisor.  It doesn't look good for
you to swoon."|stage direction
25||"The camera stays with Elliot, who is still watching the
offscreen Lee.  In the background, guests continue to
chatter warmly with each other.
Hannah, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres, walks up behind
the distracted Elliot."|location

and offscreen as Holly appears, walking down the hallway.
She holds a drink and a plate of hors d'oeuvres; she stands
at the entrance to the hallway, eating and looking at the
offscreen guests."|location
46|HANNAH|(walking offscreen)|speech

67|HOLLY|(nodding and swallowing)|speech
68||"Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for
our friends, so"|stage direction
69|HOLLY|(gesturing)|speech
70||"we thought until an acting job
comes through, we could just make
some extra money, you know, doing a
few private parties."|stage direction

72||Great idea.|stage direction
73|HANNAH|(agreeing)|speech

89||"INT. HANNAH'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
Hannah, licking her fingers, walks past a memo-cluttered
refrigerator to the stove as Holly, behind her, begins to
speak.  The faint sounds of music are still heard."|location

money."|stage direction

Mmm?"|stage direction
95||"This is the last time, I promise.
And I'm keeping strict accounts."|stage direction
96||"As Holly talks, sipping her drink, Hannah busily works in
the kitchen, which contains a large center table stacked
with bowls and plates of food, hanging pots and pans, and
general party clutter.  She walks on-and-offscreen as she
talks and listens to her sister."|location

glass and plate down
on the table)"|speech

catering idea I think's going to be
great."|stage direction

there's just a few things I have to
buy..."|stage direction

121|HOLLY|(shaking her head no)|speech
122||"I swear.  I swear.  We've already
got some requests to do a few
dinner parties."|stage direction
123||"A timer goes off.  Hannah walks past Holly to attend to some
food on a different stove.  Holly turns to face her.  Only
Holly is seen as she talks to the offscreen Hannah, the
camera moving in closer on her face.  As Holly speaks, she
distractedly nibbles an hors d'oeuvre.  In the background,
her parents can be heard singing in the living room."|location
124||"I mean, obviously, I'm not going to
be a caterer forever, you know.  We
both still go to auditions.
Something could turn up at any
moment.  But the parties are at
night, days are free, I can still
take my acting class.  I haven't
done drugs on a year."|stage direction
125||"Holly pops another hors d'oeuvre into her mouth as the
background singing gets louder and the film cuts to:
INT. HANNAH'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
The living room is crowded with family and guests sitting
comfortably on chairs near the piano, where Evan, Hannah's
father, plays ""Bewitched"" as Hannah's mother, Norma, sits
nearby, accompanying him in their duet.  A child is sprawled
out under a blanket on a sofa; some guests chatter quietly;
others drink and eat, listening."|location

memory lane again!"|stage direction

counter.  Hannah is scooping seeds out of a cantaloupe.
Holly, leaning on the table, sips her drink.  The music from
the living room is softly heard as the three sisters chat
comfortably and easily with each other."|location

such a depressive.  I thought she

takes another sip of her drink.

turning the dials on a sonometer.  Mickey sits on a nearby
high stool, large earphones on his head.  He listens with
such concentration that he squints his eyes.  He holds up a
finger in response to the sounds he hears in his headset.

fork with his finger.  He puts the vibrating fork to Mickey's
ear.  Mickey, looking up at the offscreen doctor's face, nods.

consultation room.  Dr. Abel walks from the examining room,

The movie briefly holds on a ripped, red, paint-splattered
door as Elliot, wearing a raincoat, appears nearby.  He
looks down the street and the film cuts to his point of

The movie goes back to the impatient Elliot; he's looking
around him.  He glances at his watch as the film cuts back
once again to the loft building, where Lee finally appears,
walking down the street away from Elliot.  A truck passes
down the street.  Lee doesn't see him.  She walks further
and further away; she turns a corner.
Elliot frantically looks around again; then, in a burst of
decision, he runs around a garbage dump, crossing the
street, and still running, he moves down an adjacent street,
past The Canal Lumber Company and several other buildings,
as the film cuts back to Lee, walking down a different
street, oblivious.
The jazz plays on as the movie cuts back and forth between
the fast-moving Elliot, rushing down the SoHo streets, past
a truck waiting for a light to change, past some pedestrians,
some garbage cans, turning corners, and the strolling Lee,
walking up different streets, past different buildings.
Lee eventually crosses a street, lost in thought, looking

An electrode is attached to his forehead; a nearby technician

a technician in a booth, a large window displays a huge,

prone body, begins to enter the round opening of the module.
As the camera pulls back from Mickey, his taped head under

sitting down, taps information into a computer while the
other technician stands nearby, looking from Mickey to the

From Mickey's prone form, the film moves to the two
technicians, as seen through the window in the scanner room.
They examine the computer screen and talk indistinctly to
each other.  One of the men, nodding, taps more information

While they're studying the CAT-scan picture, the camera cuts

A beautiful snow-covered church downtown, complete with
courtyard and wrought-iron fence.  A pedestrian walks by
with an umbrella.  A church choir sings a soaring hymn over
the scene.
The music continues as the film moves inside, where the
choir is seen singing behind an altar glowing warm gold.  A
fairly large congregation sits in darkened pews as the film
cuts to the back, where Mickey, his arms crossed, stands
underneath some stained-glass windows, watching and listening
to the inspiring music.
The choir continues to sing as the movie cuts to Father
Flynn in his office.
He picks up some large, heavy books from a shelf near his
window and he walks over to Mickey, who's standing near his
desk, already holding several tomes.  Father Flynn puts the
books on top of Mickey's pile; Mickey, flipping through the
top one, awkwardly carries his bundle to the door.
Next is seen a close-up of a painting of Jesus Christ on the
cross, complete with crown of thorns and holy expression.
His eyes, especially designed to blink as the lights hit
them, open and close repeatedly.  The hymn plays on, loudly,
as the camera moves back, revealing Mickey, standing outside
a barber shop window, looking at the Christ playing and
shuffling from side to side to gets its eyes' 3-D effect.
Smaller inspirational pictures border the bigger, blinking
Christ.  A barber pole with moving stripes stands nearby;
passing traffic is reflected in the window.
Mickey turns from the window, shrugging, and starts to walk
down the street, past a fruit and vegetable store with open-
air-displayed flowers, past several briskly moving
pedestrians.
With the hymn still playing, the screen goes black briefly.
Mickey opens the door, the light from a hallway illuminating
him.  He's just entered his apartment.  He closes the door
and walks through his dark foyer; he carries a brown bag.
He switches on the light, and walking past his spiral
staircase, past several framed pictures on the wall, he
makes his way to his living room coffee table.  Mickey pulls
a crucifix out of the bag; he looks at it, then puts it on
the table near a pile of books and some objets d'art.  He
then takes out a copy of the New Testament, putting it on
top of the crucifix.  Then out comes a framed picture of a
saint.  It too gets put on the growing pile.  But the bag is
not yet empty.  Next comes a large loaf of Wonder Bread and
a large jar of Hellman's mayonnaise.  Mickey sets them on
top of the saint."|location

faade.  Trees line the sidewalk.  Holly and Mickey emerge
from the door and walk up the street, revealing a whole row
of similar apartment buildings.  They pass a few other
people as they walk.
The film then moves to the outside of a charming glass and
stainedwood caf.  Through the window, Holly and Mickey can
be seen having lunch.  Holly is talking animatedly; Mickey
takes a sip of coffee.  Some people pass by.
Next, the film cuts to an almost isolated path in Central
Park, complete, with old-fashioned streetlamps and scattered
leaves.  Holly and Mickey stroll into view, deep in
conversation."|location

counterpoint to the story he is telling Holly.  A close-up

apartment appears on the screen as his voice is heard."|location

I just felt that in a Godless

living.  Now I happen to own this
rifle..."|stage direction

shuts his eyes tightly."|location

not, and pressed it to my forehead.
And I remember thinking, at the
time, I'm gonna kill myself.  Then
I thought...what if I'm wrong?
What if there is a God?  I mean,
after all, nobody really knows that."|stage direction
3471||"The camera moves past the desperate Mickey to a mirror on
the wall behind him.  Its reflection shows his spiral
staircase and some standing lamps.  A clock faintly ticks."|location
3472||"But then I thought, no.  You know,
maybe is not good enough.  I want
certainty or nothing.  And I
remember very clearly the clock was
ticking, and I was sitting there
frozen, with the gun to my head,
debating whether to shoot."|stage direction

3474||All of a sudden, the gun went off.|stage direction

everything all right?"|stage direction

living room.  He looks around frantically, his shirt loose.
Finally, he throws the rifle down between the sofa and the
coffee table.  The gun goes off a second time.  Mickey,
standing nearby, jumps, his hands flying to his head.  The
doorbell rings; the neighbors begin pounding at the door."|location
3484||"And suddenly, neighbors were, were,
pounding on the door, and-and I
don't know, the whole scene was
just pandemonium.  And, uh, you
know, and I-I-I-I-I ran to the door."|stage direction

again around the living room."|location

Mickey, walking slowly along the sidewalk, passes several
other pedestrians and numerous storefronts, including
Klein's Pharmacy and a ""Bar-B-Q"" take out.  Occasionally, he
is obscured by a tree trunk on the opposite side of the
street; a few taxis go by as he talks over the scene."|location
3490||"I...I-I-I-I had to get out of that
house.  I had to just get out in
the fresh air and-and clear my head.
And I remember very clearly.  I
walked the streets.  I walked and I
walked.  I-I didn't know what was
going through my mind.  It all
seemed so violent and un-unreal to
me.  And I wandered..."|stage direction
3491||"The movie cuts to the exterior of the Metro movie theater,
with its smoked glass entrance doors and its Art Deco feel.
An old publicity photo hangs inside.  Mickey's reflection is
seen at the almost-transparent doors, as well as the
reflection of the street and various cars whizzing by.  His
reflection walks towards the theater entrance; he continues
his story."|location
3492||"...for a long time on the Upper
West Side, you know, an-and it must
have been hours!  You know, my, my
feet hurt.  My head was, was
pounding, and, and I had to sit
down.  I went into a movie house.
I-I didn't know what was playing or
anything."|stage direction
3493||"Mickey walks into the movie house.  He is seen through the
glass doors, which still reflect the street and traffic
outside.  He makes his way through the lobby into the actual
theater."|location

gather my thoughts and, and be
logical, and, and put the world
back into rational perspective."|stage direction
3495||"The film abruptly cuts to the theater's black-and-white
screen, where the Marx Brothers, in Duck Soup, play the
helmets of several soldiers standing in a line like a live
xylophone.  The sounds of the ""xylophone"" are heard as the
movie cuts to the darkened theater, where Mickey slowly sits
down in a balcony seat.  The ""xylophone"" music stops and
changes to ""Hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-hidee-ho"" as sung
by the Marx Brothers and ensemble in the movie.  The singing
continues faintly in the background as Mickey continues his
tale:"|location

film that I'd seen many times in my
life since I was a kid, an-and I

people up on the screen, and I
started getting hooked o-on the
film, you know?"|stage direction

Mickey continues to talk.  The Marx Brothers, as well as the
hundred-odd other cast members in Duck Soup, are kneeling

heels up in the air.  They sway back and forth, hands
clasped, singing ""Oh-h-h-h-h-h..."""|location

you even think of killing yourself?

there on the screen.  You know,
they're real funny, and, and what
if the worst is true?"|stage direction

the dark theater.  The Oh-h-h-h-h-h's coming from the
offscreen movie are heard as he continues to speak."|location

only go around once and that's it?
Well, you know, don't you want to
be part of the experience?  You
know, what the hell, it-i-it's not
all a drag.  And I'm thinking to
myself, geez, I should stop ruining
my life..."|stage direction
3503||"As Mickey talks, the film cuts back to the antics of the
Marx Brothers on the black-and-white theater screen.  The
four brothers are now swaying and singing and strutting,
their voices indistinct over Mickey's narration."|location

gonna get, and just enjoy it while
it lasts.  And...you know..."|stage direction

Nobody really knows.  I know, I
know ""maybe"" is a very slim reed to
hang your whole life on, but that's
the best we have.  And...then, I
started to sit back, and I actually
began to enjoy myself."|stage direction

black-and-white screen.  The Marx Brothers are sitting on a
judge's bench, playing banjos and singing with the other

movie cuts back to Central Park.  The flashback is over.
Mickey and Holly continue their stroll as ""You Made Me Love
You"" begins to play in the background.  They pass some
people, a cluster of buildings that look like castles, and
the Manhattan skyline as seen through the trees, as the
camera moves back, farther and farther away from them,

3561||"The movie leaves the kitchen and cuts to the doorway between
the dining room and the living room.  Upbeat jazz plays over
the low din of the party.  Two women stand by the partially
set dining room table, chatting and arranging some plates,
as Elliot strolls into view, sipping a drink.  He passes the
women and walks through the doorway into the living room,
nodding hello to a guest who is walking the other way.
He enters the living room, smiling.  It is crowded with
guests; Hannah's children play in their midst.  One of
Hannah's boys grabs Elliot's arm.  They playfully ""spar"" for
a moment before Elliot laughingly shakes him off, continuing
on his way into a connecting room.  He stops at the doorway,
looking at the crowd.  The camera shows his point of view:
Guests stand in clusters, enjoying themselves; one woman
chats with a little boy; another woman, carrying a drink,
walks over to a group of other guests.
The film then cuts back briefly to Elliot, holding his drink
and looking straight ahead, as it shows his point of view
once more.  This time he sees a smiling Lee and Doug,
talking animatedly; a few guests are seen in the background.
Elliot's voice is heard over a close-up of the couple."|location

ahead.  The camera moves in closer to his face as he talks
over the scene."|location

know what came over me.  That
complete conviction that I couldn't
live without you."|stage direction

talking animatedly and smiling.  Lee gently pushes back
Doug's hair."|location

rendition of ""Isn't It Romantic"" is heard on the piano as
Holly, shrugging the strap of her pocketbook off her
shoulder, walks towards the living room.  She is stopped by
three guests--two women, one of them wearing glasses, and a

doorway into the living room and listening to the offscreen
Evan play the piano.  Elliot, holding his drink, walks over
to her.  They look at each other for a beat; Elliot then
hugs Hannah, pulling her towards him.  She leans her head on
his shoulder, fingering his jacket lapel.  They look
offscreen together, happily, intimately, at the offscreen
guests, as the camera moves across the room, past a few
guests, to reveal Evan sitting at the piano.  Norma sits at
his side, one arm resting on the piano.  She holds a drink
and looks off in the distance, mouthing the words to ""Isn't
It Romantic.""
The camera then moves to the doorway in the living room,
where a man, holding a drink, enters and joins the happy
crowd.  Evan can be seen in the background, playing his song.
A child plays near the coffee table.
The camera continues to move past the doorway, past a huge
grandfather clock, to a second doorway leading to the den.
Here, more guests are gathered; a child sits in a small
chair by the sofa.  He sips a soda as female guest #2 enters
the room and crouches down next to him, smiling.  She waves
to him.  He waves back as the camera continues to move past
the doorway to reveal Holly, standing in front of a hallway
mirror, fixing her earrings.  Mavis can be seen in the
background, through the doorway into the dining room,
lighting the candles on the table.  She dims the lights,
darkening the room and the hallway where Holly stands in a
warm candlelit glow.  Mavis leaves the dining room and
passes Holly."|location
