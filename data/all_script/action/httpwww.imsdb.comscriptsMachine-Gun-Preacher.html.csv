Without sound or movement and nothing is in definition. All we see
are degrees of blackness in this unlit world. The vague impressions
of an African village in the void... a ragged line of tukuls (straw
huts)... a bicycle propped against a mud wall... a soccer ball in
the dirt..."|stage direction

8||EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT|location

The family bolts awake, moving to their feet as the door to their
tukul SLAMS open -- THREE soldiers from the Lord's Resistance Army
(LRA) coming in carrying AK47's -- shouting in Arabic -- ""Get up!
Get up!"" -- the FATHER stepping forward -- holding up his hands --
""Don't shoot!"" --
KAK! KAK! KAK!
And he's gunned down in cold blood. The soldiers grab the mother and
boys and begin to drag them out of the tukul -- but WILLIAM breaks
free -- scrambles deeper into the room --
THE SOLDIER going after him -- WILLIAM darting behind a stack of
storage boxes knocking them to the ground -- frantically burrowing
into the corner -- trying to get away but it's useless -- THE
SOLDIER grabs his feet and begins to pull him out -- WILLIAM KICKING
WILDLY -- digging his nails into the dirt -- and as he's dragged out
of the corner he reaches out... inadvertently grabs a FADED

another soldier -- pointing to WILLIAM'S mother and she's pulled
from the group and forced onto her knees...
... and WILLIAM is brought in front of her -- his captor saying
something in Arabic as he hands him a club -- ""Kill her!"" -- WILLIAM
shaking his head `no' -- tossing the club in the dirt and --
CRACKKK! -- WILLIAM is hit with the butt of a rifle -- goes down --
blood streaming down his face as he's pulled back up to his feet --
crying -- shaking with fear...
... and then he sees his mother staring up at him... and despite the
hell unfolding around them we see a moment here between mother and
son... something calm and reassuring in the way she's looking at him
now... her eyes full of love... and pity... for her child in this

abductions. These children are tortured, raped, sold into sex
slavery, and forced to take part in ritualized killing by LRA
commanders.
The Islamic Government of Sudan continues to provide weapons and
safe haven to Kony and the LRA as part of a deal to wage a proxy war
against the predominately Christian South.
Without pressure from the United States, this support will continue
and more innocent children will be slaughtered.
