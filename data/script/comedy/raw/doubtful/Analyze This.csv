PURPOSES ONLY
1   CREDITS BEGIN OVER BLACK.                                    1
DOMINIC MANETTA
a man in his 70s, narrates nostalgically OVER a MONTAGE
of related news photos.
MANETTA (V.O.)
1957 was a big year. The Russians
put that Sputnik into outer space,
the Dodgers played their last game
at Ebbets Field, 'that guy' shot
Frank Costello in the head, and
missed, and the Gallo brothers
whacked Albert Anastasia in that
barber shop in the Park Sheraton
Hotel. It was total chaos. With
Anastasia gone, Vito Genovese
figures he's king shit, but Carlo
Gambino and 'Joe Bananas' both
want to be boss of all bosses. So
they call a meeting -- a big
meeting.
2   EXT. UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY                                  2
CREDITS CONTINUE. In FADED 16mm documentary-style, we
see a country road winding through rolling hills. At the
top of the hill, a black '57 Cadillac appears and sweeps
through the peaceful landscape.
MANETTA (V.O.)
It was the first time the whole
commission was ever gonna meet
face to face. Bosses and wiseguys
were comin' in from all over the
country, and all the New York
families, too -- maybe sixty
bosses, the whole wiseguy world --
all headin' toward this little
town upstate to figure out what's
what.
3   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                          3
A sign reads, ""Entering Apalachin - pop. 342."" The black
Cadillac speeds past the sign, then another black Caddy,
then a black Lincoln, then another Caddy, a Lincoln, etc.
MANETTA (V.O.)
Your father and me, we were goin'
up with Tommy D., Fat Tommy.

MANETTA (V.O.CONT'D)
He was running the family at the
time. Anyway, I don't know what
anybody was thinking, but some
asshole thought it would be a good
idea to have this meeting at Joe
Babara's farm in the country where
nobody would notice.
4   EXT. RURAL GAS STATION - DAY                                  4
A local state police deputy is gassing up his motorcycle
when the parade of shiny black cars rolls by. He looks
up and scratches his head at the unusual sight.
MANETTA (V.O.)
Turns out the local cops were
watching Joe Babara like a hawk.
So now you got about fifty Caddies
and Lincolns pullin' into Apalachin
and some deputy sheriff with cow
shit on his shoes notices all the
traffic and calls the Feds.
5   EXT. JOE BABARA'S ESTATE - DAY                                5
The Caddies and Lincolns are all parked around a rambling
country manor. Bosses and wiseguys are meeting and
greeting each other on the big front porch.
One WISEGUY is trying to shoo a cow away from his car.
WISEGUY
You wanna be a ribeye?   Get away
from the fuckin' car.
6   EXT. WOODS - SAME TIME                                        6
Federal agents start moving in quietly, heavily-armed,
wearing big FBI arm bands.
MANETTA (V.O.)
The meeting never even got
started. The Feds moved in --
7   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                              7
Agents with weapons drawn charge the house and start

Then along comes this farmer who

so your father hauls out his piece,
this .44 cannon he used to carry,

Funniest fuckin' thing I ever saw.

everybody's dealing drugs; people
are getting whacked without
permission. And on top of
everything, now we got the Chinese
Triads and these crazy Russians to
deal with. Everything's changing.
We need a leader. Someone with
fresh ideas. Someone like you.
It's gonna be a new century, Paul.

Correction. Mr. Vitti couldn't

about me you should know. I never
got married, Doctor Sobol. I
don't have a hobby. I never got a
dog or a cat. I don't even have a
goldfish. I live for one reason
only, and that's to serve Mr. Paul
Vitti. He's what I'm thinking about
when I wake up, and he's what I'm
thinking about when I close my eyes
to sleep. If he told me to jump off
a tall building, not only would I do
it, I would hope to survive so I could
do it again and again until he told me
to stop. This is all I know. This is
all I got. So please don't think I
won't kill you, because I'd hate for
your last thought to be a wrong one.
You're going to that meeting.

BEN
This is insane.

Then you just keep your mouth
shut, and hope nobody asks you
nothin'.
JIMMY
Boy, this is some fuckin' plan.
