1   EXT. SKY - DAY                                              1
Fluffy white CLOUDS drift across a clear blue sky.

FADE TO WHITE:
TITLE CARD-

A dull WHINE is heard building in volume until finally-
SMASH CUT TO:
2   INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY    2
Startled, STEVEN RUSSELL (40) opens his eyes. Gaunt and
pale, he seems to be on death's door. The whine we once
heard is now the high-pitched ALARM of medical equipment.
The door BURSTS open. NURSES enter, rushing toward him.
The nurses pass him and attend to the PATIENT in the next
bed over, frantically administering CPR.
SUPER: ""TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY INFIRMARY - 1998""
A DOCTOR appears and pushes the nurses aside.
DOCTOR
Where's the crash cart!?
He straddles the patient's chest and pushes down hard-
the sound of a sternum CRACKING can be heard.
Steven returns his gaze to the ceiling. A CHEERY VOICE
counterpoints the bleakness of this scene.
STEVEN (V.O.)
(upbeat and happy)
Love sure is a funny thing...
It makes you happy. Makes you sad. Makes
you do all sorts of things you never
thought you'd do before. Love's the
reason I'm here actually.

A group of FOUR NINE YEAR OLDS lie in the grass atop a

LITTLE GIRL
It's right there.
A young STEVEN RUSSELL (9) is among them.
YOUNG STEVEN
It's really big.

Young Steven sits in the middle of the couch. His PARENTS
and 11 year old BROTHER stand before him. He stares at
them- innocent and doe-eyed with a big smile on his face.
STEVEN'S MOM
Are you a happy little boy Steven?
Steven smiles and nods."|unknown
1||"You've always been such a happy little
boy.
(then)
Now Steven, we want to tell you something
very important, but I want you to
understand that it doesn't change a
thing.
Steven awaits, smiling.
STEVEN'S MOM (CONT'D)
We're still gonna love you, you're still
gonna be our happy little boy and you're
still gonna--
STEVEN'S BROTHER
You're adopted.

YOUNG STEVEN
Shut up!
He glares at his brother, then turns back to his mother.
Her face says it all.
STEVEN'S MOM
It's true.
WHACK! She SWATS his brother in the head. Steven starts
putting things together.
STEVEN'S MOM (CONT'D)
Your brother overheard your Dad and I
talking and well, we didn't want you to
hear it from anybody but us.
(then)
It's true. You're a special little boy.
You know why? Because we chose you. Not
like your brother here who's natural.
STEVEN'S DAD
Your Mother's right. It's cause we love
you. So we put some money in a brown
paper bag and gave it to your real mom in
the hospital parking lot so you could
come home with us. Okay?
STEVEN'S MOM
It doesn't change a thing honey. We love
you just as much as we love your brother
here...
(best of intentions)
...and he's natural.
STEVEN'S DAD
So son, are you okay?
Steven smiles wide.
YOUNG STEVEN
Yes Daddy.
As his parents prattle on, Steven's VO comes full.
STEVEN (V.O.)
It hurt a bit, but I decided I wasn't
gonna let it get me down. No way. I was
gonna be the best son- No, the best
person I could be."|unknown

Hallelujah! We Shall Rise.
Amidst this white-man's paradise sits a smiling and
healthy STEVEN- playing the organ with a happy-stick
planted firmly up his ass.
As the joyous flock whoops it up, Steven winks to his
wife (DEBBIE) and their 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER (STEPHANIE)
who sit in the first row.
Steven, oblivious, hits a sour note or two-- but keeps on
playing with happy abandon. The crowd continues to enjoy
the inspiring hymn."|location

DEBBIE

would have never found that last coffee
filter and Prayer-Girls would have been
ruined. So thank you for that."|unknown
19||"Amen.
Steven moves to get up but settles back in when she
continues.
DEBBIE
And thank you for Steffie's allergy
screen coming back all negative. I always
knew it was in your plan for her to enjoy
nuts. And finally I want to thank you
for this man Jesus. This man who works
so hard to make us happy without even a
thought for himself.
Steven smiles at that sentiment. Again he moves to get up
when--

the Earth and promised me a life of
eternal happiness. A promise he has kept
oh Lord. Every day. Amen."|unknown

CLICK. In bed with Debbie, Steven switches off the light
and lets out a hearty YAWN.
STEVEN
I'm absolutely bushed.
DEBBIE
Me too.
They turn on their sides, back to back in the bed. After
a few moments of SILENCE, Steven rolls over and puts his
arm around her, gently feeling her breasts.
Debbie turns on her back and they kiss quietly as Steven
quietly gets on top. In moments, they are rocking with
the gentle rhythm of everyday sex.
Just as things are peaking, Steven suddenly STOPS and
strikes a conversational tone.
STEVEN
Deb- You know how, as a cop, I have lots
of access? You know- records and things?
DEBBIE

Listen-
STEVEN
Shhhhhh.   Mommy please- let me finish.
What color that remains in her face drains away.
STEVEN (CONT'D)
We   all make mistakes. What I came here
to   say is, I forgive you because none of
us   is perfect but now with a fresh start
we   can build --
She SLAMS the door in his face.   From behind the door-
MRS. BASCOMBE (O.S.)
I have no idea what you're talking about,
Steven.
STEVEN
No, it's okay, I know everything.    But
it's fine. Just tell me why--
MRS. BASCOMBE (O.S.)
Go away!
STEVEN
Okay, okay. I understand. It's a lot at
once. But I can come back. How's that?
I can come back later, I'll bring us some
coffee and we can talk about...

WHY YOU ABANDONED ME AND KEPT YOUR OTHER

This seems to be cut and dried here, sir.
I don't even know why we're back here.
Mister Russell is treating this like an
episode of Matlock.
STEVEN
I'll admit your honor- I'm a plain spoken
man. I didn't go to Princeton. I didn't
go to Yale. My education was modest. I
went to a small school. I grew up on a
small farm. But I passed the same bar
exam as my colleague here and I am not
going to let him push around this humble
woman.
This scores with the judge.

Point taken Mister Russell...
He glares at the other lawyer with scorn.

then I promise I'll never be anything
else ever again.
A LONG, LONG SILENCE.   Phillip looks to him.
PHILLIP
How do I know you're not bullshitting me
again?
Steven pauses.   He looks Phillip square in the eye.
STEVEN
You don't.
And as Phillip stares at him-

FADE IN:
209    INT. TEXAS COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - 1998 - DAY                209
At a window, a CLERK stamps a few documents and hands
them to Steven, who is dressed in his lawyer attire.
Steven exits the line and ducks into a nearby bathroom.
210    INT. TEXAS COURTHOUSE MEN'S ROOM - 1998 - DAY              210
At the urinal, Steven whistles to himself.
SUPER: ""Steven Russell was arrested two weeks later
trying to secure Phillip's release.""
Steven turns his head to find the man at the next urinal
staring at him. It's a very surprised Birkheim with a
badge affixed to his jacket reading, ""JUROR"".
Steven SMILES at him.
211    INT. TEXAS COURTROOM - 1999 - DAY                          211
Steven sits in court while a FEMALE D.A. argues her case.
SUPER: ""An embarrassment to the State of Texas and
Governor George Bush, Steven was given an unprecedented
life sentence.""
She nods to the audience where Lindholm sits smiling.
SUPER: ""Coincidentally, the D.A. who prosecuted him was
the Sister in law of Dan Lindholm- Steven's former boss""
212    INT. LOCKDOWN CELL, 1999 - NIGHT                           212
Steven smiles wide, shackled in a solitary 6 by 7 cell.
SUPER: ""Steven sits in 23 hour-a-day lockdown, with only
one hour a day for supervised showers and exercise.""
Steven stares at his Key West CALENDAR with a small photo
of Phillip attached to it.
The cell brightens, everything around Steven blooms with
white light. He looks to see."|unknown
