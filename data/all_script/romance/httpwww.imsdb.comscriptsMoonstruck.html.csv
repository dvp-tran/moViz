end in a shaft of morning sunlight. They are standing on end
in bins. In the window, ZITO'S can be read in reverse.
We leave the loaves and DRIFT DOWN TO a Progresso Products
calendar, which hangs from the wall by a nail. The month is
November. Various phone numbers and delivery dates have been
penned in in a rough scrawl. Now WE GO TO a white formica
counter, scuffed and pocked from long use. On the counter,
in a rinsed out olive jar filled with water, are three fat
red roses. The TITLE APPEARS IN BLACK SCRIPT AGAINST THE
WHITE BACKGROUND."|stage direction

with me, and three times they come
back. Who they kidding? They cheap,
cheap, cheap. The other bread they
get is no good. They save pennies.
Everybody complain and they come
back. ""Zito, your bread is the best.""
They're like children stupid in school
who cannot learn. The water. It's
the water. You buy bread in Hoboken,
you get Hoboken water. Hoboken water
is dry. Ask anybody who knows. Ask
your father. He knows."|speech
8||"During Zito's plaintive words, WE LEAVE the roses and MOVE
DOWN the counter TO a calculator being tapped very efficiently
with the eraser end of pencil. When the results appear, the
pencil notes the figure in a threadbare old ledger.
NOW WE SEE ZITO
He's a middle-aged Italian man with a kind face. But it's
early in the day, and he's already been working for hours,
so he's a little tired and disgruntled."|stage direction

are hung. The gap creates visual frame. In the frame is
ROBERT. He is operating the grid with a little stick shift.
He stops it and takes down a garment. He leaves the frame,
heading off to the counter. When he moves away, WE SEE that
Loretta is behind him, working her calculator, entering in a
ledger. She slams the ledger shut, waves goodbye, and goes.

MUSIC
A VIOLIN PLAYS a melancholy Neapolitan air.
MR. JOHNNY and Loretta sit at a table for two talking quietly.
They have their menus and glasses of red wine. Mr. Johnny is
Italian, around 42. His wavy salt-and pepper hair is
impeccably combed back; but there is so much that it threatens
to fall forward someday and engulf his face. He is wearing a
pinky ring, a dark suit, a gold watch, and, on his face, a
mustache and a look of incredible seriousness. Loretta is
Italian, 37. Her black hair, done in a dated style, is flecked
with grey. She is wearing a dark blouse, black skirt, and
high heels. One of her teeth is framed with gold work.
Mr. Johnny is really timid of life, an overgrown boy, who
hides these qualities behind a veil of dignity.
Loretta is tough and efficient, loyal and watchful; she
watches out for Mr. Johnny, and defends him against life.
BOBO, an Old World Italian waiter, comes over to take their
order."|stage direction

Two huge Chagalls, one to the right and one to the left,
inhabit the face of the building, filling it with marvelous
color.
LORETTA COMES TO THE FOUNTAIN
The fountain is quiet and dark now. Loretta is puzzled.
She remembers that it was going. While she looks, it lights
up. Then small jets of water begin to appear. Then larger
jets.
Then with a roar the central shaft of water rises high, higher
into the night sky. She follows the column of water with her
eyes up into the sky. Right above the crest of the water,
like a beanball on a seal's nose, is the moon.
FROM OVER LORETTA'S SHOULDER WE SEE THE RUSHING WATER
Forming an opaque wall before her. Then the fountain, for
its next piece of aquatic choreography, drops away to nothing
quite suddenly. And there, facing Loretta, on the opposite
side of the fountain, is Ronny.
He's looking incredibly handsome and dashing in a tuxedo and
topcoat and, of course, gloves. He smiles slightly and raises
a hand in greeting. Loretta, caught off guard, smiles
brilliantly at him. Then she remembers her situation and
starts to put on her usual serious expression. But the
fountain has rushed up into the sky again, obscuring her
attempt at composure from, Ronny.
