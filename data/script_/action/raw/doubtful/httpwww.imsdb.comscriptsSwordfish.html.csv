We hear OVER...
GABRIEL (V.O.)
You know the problem with
Hollywood? They make shit.
Unbelievable, unremarkable shit.
I'm not some grungy filmmaker-
wannabee searching for
existentialism through a haze of
bong-smoke. It's easy to pick
apart bad acting, short-sighted
directing, or the purely moronic
stringing together of words many
of the studios term as prose. No,
I'm talking the lack of realism.
Realism. Not a pervasive element
in the modern American cinematic
vision.
FADE IN:"|unknown
3||INT. STARBUCKS COFFEE SHOP - MORNING|location
4||"Three men sit at a window booth drinking coffee and
talking. Two of the men sit on one side of the table;
STANLEY is in his early thirties, AGENT ROBERTS, early
forties. Both wear suits, the younger's is fairly
expensive and well cut, the other's is polyester, enough
said. The MAN across, however, is quite different. He
is what they used to call a ""cool-cat.""
GABRIEL (MAN)
Take Dog Day Afternoon for
example. Arguably Pacino's
greatest performance, excepting
The Godfather, Part I, and
Scarface, of course. A
masterpiece of directing, easily
Lumet's best. The acting, the
script, cinematography, all top
notch. But, they didn't push the
envelope. What if in Dog Day,
Sonny really wanted to get away
with it? What if, and here's
where it gets tricky. What if
they'd started killing hostages?
No mercy, no quarter, meet our
demands or the cute blonde in the
bell bottoms gets one in the back
of the head, bam, splatter. What?
Still no bus?

GABRIEL (CONT'D)
How many innocent victims would
they let get sprayed across the
windows before the city reversed
its policy on hostage situations?
And this was 1976. No C.N.N., no
C.N.B.C., no M.T.V. No Internet.
Fast forward to the present, same
situation. Can you imagine the
feeding frenzy of the modern
media? In hours it would be the
top story from Boston to Budapest.
All caught in 150 millimeter zoom,
computer enhanced, and color
corrected. You would practically
taste the brain matter. Six
hostages die. Ten. Twelve.
Twenty. Thirty. Relentless. One
after another. All over a bus, a
plane, and a couple of million
dollars that were federally
insured.
He sits, letting the pictures sink in, then:
GABRIEL
Just a thought. I mean it's not
really within the realm of
conventional cinema, but what
if...?
ROBERTS
You know, this movie of yours, I
don't think it would have worked."|unknown
5||"Really?   How come?
ROBERTS

after.

Stanley shakes his head.
STANLEY
Bad guy can't win. It's a

other, he's gotta go down."|unknown
7||"Oh, well. Life does tend to be
stranger than fiction.
(looking at watch)
Well, guys, gotta jet. This place
is kinda dead.
CAMERA PANS AROUND the coffee shop. Not a soul in the
place. We CONTINUE TO PAN AROUND 270 DEGREES TO the
front door, which is open. Outside the open doorway are
crouched a squad of heavily body-armored SWAT members,
packed together, and aiming automatic weapons inside.
ANGLE ON GABRIEL
GABRIEL
Thanks for the coffee.
He gets up. In his left hand, which has been hidden by
the table until now, he is holding a strange-looking
spring-loaded grip. Gabriel is looking back at them.
Smiles.
GABRIEL
Rene Descartes is sitting in some
bar in Paris. Bartender says,
'Hey, you want another drink?'
Descartes says, 'I think not.'
And disappears.
He smiles at his own joke, then turns and walks over to
the front door.
GABRIEL
Move.
No one even twitches.
GABRIEL
I won't ask again.

ANGLE ON ROBERTS
who nods his head. The SWAT team moves back, letting
Gabriel out of the coffee shop.
GABRIEL
Thank you.
Gabriel looks back at Stan sitting in the booth.
GABRIEL
Stanley... you coming?
Stan slides from the booth as Gabriel exits the coffee
shop --
2   EXT. STARBUCKS COFFEE SHOP - DAY                              2
SILENCE -- no sounds on the SOUNDTRACK.
Gabriel and Stanley stop just outside the doorway.
Gabriel dons a pair of hip little shades, then continues
across the sidewalk and into the street.
He nonchalantly looks up. Suddenly the THUMP of
HELICOPTERS and the WAIL of SIRENS dominates the
soundtrack.
Pandemonium. HELICOPTERS RIP the sky, L.A. County PD and
a bunch of news vultures. Squad cars block off both ends
of the street while SWAT trucks, news vans, and looky-
loos are packed together into the distance.
Sharpshooters lean out of windows and snipers are
positioned on every open rooftop. Hundreds of weapons
are pointed at this man who saunters across the street as
if he's on his way to Sunday service, without a care in
the world.
Slowly, Stanley follows Gabriel into the street.
Gabriel steps up on the far sidewalk, a huge armored bus
blocks most of the windows. He walks beside the bus,
under a huge ""WORLD BANC"" sign, and through the glass
front door, which shuts IN OUR FACE.

The interior of the bank looks like New Orleans on Fat
Tuesday. Three Hummers sit in the middle of the floor,
surrounded by broken glass. Between them rests a bright
red Ferrari F50 (Gabriel's).
All but one of the front windows of the bank, the one
with the door in it, has been welded over with 3/4 inch
plate steel.
Over two dozen hostages lie face down on the floor, arms
cable-tied behind their backs. Something has been duct-
taped around their chests and each is wearing what
appears to be a dog collar.
The other occupants of the room are nine men. All of
whom would look as if they were attending the fashion
event of the year were it not for the automatic weapons
each one carries.
GABRIEL
How we doin'?
One of the ARMED MEN finishes putting a collar on a
young, normally good-looking-but-now-covered-in-mascara,
whimpering blonde girl.

The front door opens and one of the suited men drags out
the pretty blonde from earlier. She is sobbing and is in
such grief she can't even walk.

scramble around handling problems. The PHONE RINGS.

Ladies and gentlemen, we will be
in your lives for approximately 55
more minutes. This bus has just
become your new yard. So sit
back, think happy thoughts, and
this will be over before you can
say 'cat in the hat.'
Gabriel, smiling, turns to Stanley.
GABRIEL
Whaddaya think, Stanley?
STANLEY
You'll never get away. Even if
they have to kill everyone on
the bus.
GABRIEL
Really? Five hundred bucks says I
do. Tell ya what, Stanley, I'll

Gabriel walks to the front of the bus, puts on a headset,

We are moving through the city. Behind the bus, a huge
caravan of police cars and SWAT trucks follow.
GABRIEL

Stan slides out of the seat and walks to the front with
Gabriel. All the hostages' eyes are on him. At the
front he looks at Gabriel.

Stan turns to Gabriel, angry.   He grabs him, pushing him.
STANLEY
How the fuck can you justify all
this?
GABRIEL
You're not looking at the big
picture.
Gabriel pushes him backward against the hand rail.
GABRIEL
Stanley, here's a scenario. You
have the power to cure all of the
world's diseases. But the price
for this is that you must kill a
single, innocent child. Could you
kill that child to save the world?
STANLEY
No.

You disappoint me, Stanley.   It's
the greatest good.
Silence for several beats.

GABRIEL
Now you're getting it.   How about
a hundred?
Gabriel becomes intense.
GABRIEL
How about a thousand? Not to save
the world, but just to preserve
our way of life.
STANLEY
No man has the right to make that
decision. You're no different
than any other terrorist.
GABRIEL
You're wrong, Stanley. Some men
are put here to shape destiny, to
protect freedom, despite the
atrocities they must commit. I am
one of those men. Thousands die
every day for no reason at all,
where is your bleeding heart for
them? You give your twenty
dollars to Greenpeace every year
and think you are changing the
world. What countries will
harbor terrorists, when they
realize the consequences of what
I will do? Did you know I can
buy nuclear warheads in Minsk
for forty million each? I buy
half a dozen, I even get a
discount.

Roberts runs onto the roof and sees Stanley who has the
STINGER to his shoulder. He hits the ""on"" switch and
it WHINES TO LIFE.
He sights through the scope as the EXPLORER SCREAMS away
and pulls the trigger. The MISSILE RIPS OUT of the tube
and flies toward the EXPLORER.
BOOM.
The MISSILE EXPLOSION combined with the fuel creates a
tremendous fireball.
Roberts runs and tackles Stanley to the ground. Suddenly,
SWAT GUYS dressed in full combat gear including masks that
cover their faces surround them.
They cuff them.    One of them almost steps on Stanley's
face.

We see DOCTOR MICHEALS leaning over what is left of
Gabriel's barely recognizable burned upper torso and
head. Stan and Roberts walk into the room through the
metal doors and stop at the end of the table. Dr.
Micheals nervously looks up at Stanley and steps back.
Stanley looks down at the body.
STANLEY
Are we sure this is Gabriel?
Micheals walks over to a light-board on the wall and
flicks it on. A full dental X-ray glows. Micheals hangs
another over-top of it.
DOCTOR MICHEALS
The body's dentals exactly match
the dentals the Israeli government
sent us for an ex-Mossad agent
named Gabriel Shears.
CLOSEUP ON FACE
It is indeed Gabriel a.k.a. Gabriel Shear.
WIDER
ROBERTS
It sure looks like Gabriel Shear.
What the hell was he doing in
