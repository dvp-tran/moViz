2||"BEVERLY HILLS STREET - NIGHT
It is late night, and deserted. Engine noise approaches;
headlights appear; as the car draws closer we hear singing.
It is a Mercedes convertible and as it roars by, the singing --
a sloppy baritone and a giggling soprano -- whooshes by with
it.
We hold as another car approaches. This one is a conservative
sedan, whose occupant does not sing.
INSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE
The middle-aged driver is in a tuxedo with a rumpled shirt
and cocked bow tie. He is flushed, a Rogue forelock bouncing
over his forehead, and he merrily sings ""Casey Jones"" along
with the passenger, a young woman in a party dress who
squeals, rocks with the motion of the car, and
enthusiastically pipes in on the chorus.
ANOTHER EMPTY STREET
The convertible makes a hot turn onto the street and
approaches with its singing.
REVERSE
The car enters and roars away. After a beat of quiet, the
conservative sedan enters and recedes.
BEACH
We are at the Malibu Guest Quarters Motel. The singing,
squealing Mercedes screeches into the lot and rocks to a
halt.
The young woman staggers out still giggling, and holding a
half-empty bottle of champagne.
The man tosses her a key with a large plastic tag."|stage direction

The man twists his rear-view mirror to look at himself. He
straightens his bow tie. He puffs his bounding forelock with
one finger, nods his head to make it bounce, grins
approvingly, and cocks a pistol-finger at his own reflection."|stage direction

All from the perspective of a moving automobile.
The moving shots show mansions, palm trees, boutiques; we
pass joggers, strolling businessmen holding cellular phones
to their ears, male models working as waiters at sidewalk
cafes, young women on roller blades who turn, smile, and
wave at the camera. It is la dolce vita Los Angeles style.

A handsome, fortyish man in a town car talks into cellular
phone. This is MILES MASSEY."|stage direction

Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Have Wrigley look
up Oliphant v. Oliphant for its
relevance to the Chapman filing. She
took the kids where? Tahoe? Which
side of Tahoe. Great. If the cruise
goes all the way around the lake,
she left the state and she's in
breach. She can't leave the state.
Tell Wrigley to prepare a filing to
attach everything. Primary residence,
autos, stocks..."|speech

60||Miles addresses a group of young Attorneys at the firm.|stage direction
61|MILES|"The problem is that everyone is
willing to compromise. That's the
problem with the institution of
marriage -- it's based on compromise.
Even through its dissolution. One
attorney will try to score some
points, the opposition will try to
impeach. The process will find an
equilibrium point determined by the
skill of the opposing lawyers, and
then each party will walk away with
their portion of the ""goodies."" Some
say, ""Life is compromise."" But at
Massey Myerson we believe life is
struggle and the ultimate destruction
of your opponent."|speech

that."|speech

were crazy about each other. Not
emotionally, of course. We just
couldn't keep our hands off each
other."|speech

82|REX|But then... But then...|speech
83||Quietly.|stage direction
84|MILES|Time marches on. Ardor cools.|speech

cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And
very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of
it out there."|speech

correct with me, Rex."|speech
89|REX|"Seems like there's more of it than
ever before --"|speech
90|MILES|"Well, with the expanding global
population -- Let me ask you this --
your wife. Has she pursued the
opportunities which must present
themselves to the ""knock-out, sexy
woman"" you described?"|speech
91|REX|I don't know. I can assume...|speech
92|MILES|"Not in court you can't. Has she
retained counsel?"|speech
93|REX|I'm not sure.|speech
94|MILES|"And your wife is aware of or has
evidence of your activities?"|speech
95|REX|Video.|speech
96|MILES|"Mmm... And to cut to the chase,

pre-nup?"|speech
97||"Rex hangs his head.
Miles sighs sympathetically."|stage direction
98|MILES|"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in
our stars, but in ourselves. Well,
let me ask you this: what kind of
settlement do you seek? What are,
for you, the parameters of the
possible?"|speech
99|REX|"That's the problem. I can't afford
to give her anything."|speech
100|MILES|Nothing?|speech
101|REX|"I know that sounds rough but I'm
about to close on a deal to develop
some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged
up to my ass. If this deal goes south,
I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions."|speech
102|MILES|"So, you propose that in spite of
demonstrable infidelity on your part,
your unoffending wife should be tossed
out on her ear?"|speech

don't love... And I can't submit a
child to divorce."|speech
