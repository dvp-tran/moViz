""I give you the secret of all secrets. Mirrors are the gates
through which death comes and goes. Tell no one.""
Orphée, Jean Cocteau

1||"A subway screeches by at full speed revealing a station platform
somewhere in Harlem.
A man runs for his life in the deserted space. He's an African
American male in his forties wearing a security guard uniform.
He turns into an empty corridor, climbs a set of stairs towards
the exit, but- The gates are down and the station is closed.
Desperate and out of breath, he is forced to trace his way back,
searching for an exit or a place to hide. He sees a door to the
public restroom and runs inside."|stage direction|||

3||"The place is deserted as well. One of the mirrors is smashed
while the others are covered by graffiti and dirt -
The neon lights are flickering, bringing the place in and out of
the dark.
The man checks each stall one at a time.
His face lights up as he looks inside the last one-
A SMALL WINDOW ABOVE THE TOILET IS JUST BIG ENOUGH FOR HIM TO
CRAWL THROUGH.
He steps onto the toilet seat but the window is shut too tight.
After a brief struggle, he swings it open, only to discover-
A wall of bricks.
Panic returns to his eyes. He slowly opens the stall door,
fearful of what could be waiting outside.
A FAINT SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS is heard.
He quickly shuts the door, holding his breath. Frozen.
Silence.
His heart racing, he exits the stall in the direction of the
sound. The place is empty.
The room is revealed by flashes of flickering neon lights.
He moves closer to the sinks and the spiderweb cracked mirror.
His image is fragmented and deformed. It resembles a Cubist
portrait."|stage direction|||

8||"He approaches and starts crying like a child. His head resting
against the mirror, he pleads for his life. Then, seeing the
dirt and grime on the mirror, his behaving shifts to another
extreme. He starts cleaning it frantically with his hands. Too
frantically-
A piece of the spiderweb cracked mirror falls on the ground.
Immediately, he bends down to pick it up but-
HIS REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR REMAINS STANDING IN SILENCE,
WATCHING HIM.
Looking up, the man realizes his reflection has become
independent. A separate being...
Terrified, he slowly stands staring at his stationary double.
The pointy and sharp piece of broken mirror in his hand reflects
the neon lights just like a knife blade.
His eyes turn cold with fear when-
HIS DOUBLE IN THE MIRROR STABS ITSELF DEEP IN ITS THROAT!
IN REALITY, THE MAN HAS NOT MOVED AN INCH, YET HIS THROAT RIPS
OPEN, RELEASING A RIVER OF BLOOD.
Void of any facial expression, the man's reflection slices his
jugular from end to end.
In reality, the man chokes on his own blood which splatters on
the mirror- TURNING THE IMAGE TO A DARK DEEP RED."|stage direction|||

LARRY
So did you find an apartment yet?
BEN
No, not yet.
LARRY
You need a place to stay?
BEN
No, I'm staying at my sister's, in
Queens.
LARRY
I didn't know you had a sister. What
does she do?

She's a bartender.

I ran into Amy the other day. How are
things going between the two of you?
Ben remains silent. He obviously doesn't want to get into that
subject.
LARRY (CONT'D)
So, why did you want to see me Ben?
BEN
You know what I want. I'm ready to
come back, I'm feeling much better
now.
LARRY
Listen Ben, I can't bring you back on
the force. Nobody in the squad wants
you around right now. I'm sorry but I
have to be honest with you. You
understand, right?
BEN
Larry, I'm telling you, I'm ready.
LARRY
If it was up to me, I would bring you
back tomorrow, but I'm not the only
one who decides. Listen, I think I've
got something else for you. I know a
guy at the Mayflower corporation and
they need someone to watch over one of
their department stores.
BEN
What?! Come on Larry, a security guard
job... I'm not ready to retire yet!
LARRY
Hey! I'm just trying to help here. I
know you're over qualified for that
position but it's a good opportunity
for you for the time being...until the
situation here quiets down. Also the
money is not that bad.
Ben is having a hard time to contain his anger.
LARRY (CONT'D)
You need the money, Ben. You're in the
middle of a divorce and you've got
child support to cover. If you want to
see your kids, you've got to get a
job, any job.
Deep inside, Ben knows Larry's right.

BEN
I do. The one that burned down?
LARRY
Yes, their night watchman hasn't shown
up for work in several days. They need
someone right away. Take it, relax,
and we will talk about your situation
again in a couple months.
BEN
Yeah, in a couple months... I gave
everything for the NYPD. I almost died
out there. Everyone seems to have
forgotten that.

The damage from the fire is still noticeable on the facade of

The fire appears to have started on the ground floor and seems
to have spread all the way up to the top. Some of the windows
are shattered, while others are boarded up. What was once an
impressive ornate building, a fine example of 1920's
architecture standing on one of Manhattan's most dynamic
streets, now gives off a feeling of devastation and desolation.

123||"In the reflection of one of the grand mirrors in the entrance
hall, we see Ben come down the stairs. He stops for a moment,
facing his reflection in the mirror.
He fixes his collar and looks at himself in his new clothes- Not
quite an NYPD uniform...
Suddenly, his eyes freeze. Intrigued, he comes closer to the
mirror and leans forward-
A HANDPRINT, BARELY VISIBLE, ON THE ICE COLD SURFACE.
He touches it with the tip of his fingers and tries to rub it
off, unsuccessfully. He picks up a rag from the ground, spits on
the mirror, and rubs the mark fervently. The print remains. This
confirms his hunch-
THE HANDPRINT IS INSIDE THE MIRROR...
By angling the flashlight, another handprint is revealed.
Another. And yet another-
THE ENTIRE MIRROR IS COVERED WITH HANDPRINTS, JUST AS IF A CROWD
OF PEOPLE ON THE OTHER SIDE HAD PRESSED ITSELF AGAINST THE GLASS
TO GET OUT...
As he looks back up in the mirror he sees- THE ACCESS DOOR TO
THE BASEMENT OPENING...
Ben turns around. His gaze freezes- THE ACCESS DOOR TO THE
BASEMENT IS CLOSED!
YET, IN THE MIRROR, IT CONTINUES TO SLOWLY SCREECH OPEN!
Ben swings his head back and forth, between the shut door in
reality and the opened door in the mirror. What is happening? Is
he dreaming or hallucinating?
Ben walks backwards towards the basement door, keeping his eyes
fixed on the mirror. As he goes to reach for the handle, he sees
his reflection reaching for the handle of an invisible door!
Ben opens it-
THE SYNCHRONICITY BETWEEN THE REAL WORLD AND THE ONE REFLECTED
IN THE MIRROR HAS BEEN RESTORED. Ben tries to reenact the
phenomenon. He opens and closes the door over and over, while
observing his reflection, but the mirror is no longer deceitful.
The staircase leading to the basement vanishes into the dark.
Ben hesitates."|stage direction|||

walking through the store.
Since the mysterious occurrences of the night before, his
attitude has changed. He avoids, as much as possible, looking
into the mirrors. He is on guard, fearing another supernatural
manifestation.
The shadows, the mannequins, and the shapes in the mirrors are
all disturbing and unsettling.
Even what remains of the sculptures on the top of the marble
columns seems alive in the dark.
As he crosses the entrance hall, a glint of light catches his
attention. Despite himself, he stops and gazes into the mirror-
AT THE FAR END OF THE STORE, ONE OF THE DEPARTMENTS IS IN FULL
SWING AND BATHED IN DAYLIGHT! EVERYTHING IS SPOTLESS, AS IF THE
FIRE HAD NEVER TAKEN PLACE. CUSTOMERS COME AND GO AS IF NOTHING
HAPPENED.
How is this possible? Ben turns around to see the same spot in
the real world- ONLY IT'S IN RUINS...

decides to check it out for himself...

In the basement, the water level continues to rise.
With a flashlight in hand, and his feet submerged in the water,
Ben moves deeper into the tunnel.
He is searching for the source of the leak. The beam of light
sweeps across the walls and the piping.
Ben crosses an intersection. In the corner, on the tiled wall,
he barely discerns an old inscription ingrained with decades of
dust and dirt. He sinks his hand into the water and wipes it
off, revealing an arrow pointing to, ST JOHN'S DEPARTMENT OF
PSYCHIATRY.
He continues his exploration of the subterranean passageways.
Suddenly, he notices a darker area on the wall. He comes closer
and discovers a brownish damp-spot, covered with mold. The
humidity has pearled into droplets.
He has found the source of the leak.
His hand brushes the wall, causing it to crumble instantly. Ben
digs into the plaster as if it were butter, bringing a cracked
water pipe to light. The leakage has damaged the wall in which
the tubing was embedded.
Ben hears the echoing sound of streaming water, as if there were
another room on the other side of the wall.
He pushes against the saturated wall, and pierces through it
with his arm. He removes his arm. For a moment, he observes the
gaping black hole that he has just left behind.
Ben peeks through the hole with his flashlight, but he cannot
make out what is on the other side.
He makes the hole bigger, until the passage is large enough for
him to crawl through-
ON THE OTHER SIDE, HE DISCOVERS A LARGE BRICK ROOM AND IN THE
MIDDLE OF IT ANOTHER ROOM- AN OCTAGONAL ONE WHOSE EACH AND EVERY

Ben stops to think- If he can somehow move the mirror to have it
face the last booth, he might be able to see what truly happened

Ben unhooks the mirror.
It is way too heavy and bulky to carry. He lets it slide down

Inch by inch, Ben hauls the mirror across the floor.
He reaches the last dressing room-
Through the reflection in the mirror, he examines the interior

him to confront his own image. I spent
the darkest days of my life in that

me lifeless, almost dead. Since that
day, I have never had another fit. But
deep down inside I've always known the

Ben has no time to react before ""Anna"" charges at him.

much as he can.
HER WAY OF MOVING IS NO LONGER HUMAN. MORE LIKE A STROBOSCOPIC
CONVULSION, HER MOVEMENTS ARE SOMETHING BETWEEN AN ENRAGED BEAST

blood in his face.
He applies all his strength to immobilize her- the shards of
glass dig deeper into the elderly woman's flesh, which only
seems to provide her an intense pleasure...
""Anna"" froths at the mouth. Her speech has become a deep,
animalistic, incomprehensible gurgle.
In an effortless movement, ""Anna"" pushes him away.
Her demonic strength is ten times his. Ben is merely a puppet, a
rag doll that she sends flying into the air, only to crash
violently against the brick walls...
Blood squirts onto the surface of the water.
Ben smashes into the wall separating the mirror room from the
underground passageways.
On the other side, he lands on the ground, in the dark. He
strives to regain consciousness...
Ben takes advantage of the brief respite to pull out his gun but-
""Anna"" appears from the dark and, in a flash, she strikes a
backhanded blow that sends the gun off into the air.
She lifts Ben up and throws him across the room. He rams into
the wall.
With the absence of light in the basement, Ben is defenseless.
He cannot see his assailant...
Ben is caught by the leg and dragged backwards. His hand
struggles to catch on to anything that could hold him back.

He struggles to get back on his feet-
Apart from the sound of the flowing gas, a disturbing silence
surrounds the subterranean passageways.
Ben makes out ""Anna's"" silhouette, hiding behind the leaking gas
pipe.
With his bloodied face, Ben is no longer the same man anymore-
Something in his eyes has shifted. Rage and violence have
replaced the terror and dread. He is determined to put an end to
the creature, no matter what happens.
He slides the weapon in his belt and steps, with his bare hands,
towards what once was ""Anna""...
Crouched over in the water, the demon looks up, ready to charge.
Ben takes another step forward with the same determination. The
creature thrusts itself against him-
THE CLASH IS EXTREMELY VIOLENT. Ben uses all his strength to
keep his assailant's jaw at a distance.
In a swift movement, Ben turns around AND IMPALES ""ANNA"" ON THE
BROKEN GAS PIPE!
IN A GUSH OF BLOOD THE SHARP METAL TIP PIERCES THROUGH HER
STOMACH BUT-
Despite being momentarily immobilised, the demon seems
unaffected by the near total destruction of its outer shell. On
the contrary, it struggles more violently to escape from the
trap.
Ben moves away, keeping an eye on ""Anna"". He takes his gun and
aims it at her. Ben is exhausted. With his arm outstretched, he
is ready to shoot, waiting for the right moment.
The silhouette suddenly emerges from the dark.
Ben stands by-
