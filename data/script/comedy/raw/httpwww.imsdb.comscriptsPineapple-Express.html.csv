2||"IN BLACK AND WHITE, A black 1930s Cadillac speeds down
the only visible road amidst endless plains of farmland.
The road curves sharply ahead - the car accelerates.
Ignoring the turn, the Caddy drives directly off the road
and through a massive field of emptiness.
The car abruptly stops in the middle of the vacant field.
GENERAL BRAT (58, a patch covers one of his eyes) and
AGENT BLACK SUIT (an agent in a black suit) step out of
the car.
Although there is clearly nothing in sight for miles, the
General scans his surroundings with concern.

On their side, numerous SCIENTISTS, utilizing several

at a small table with a microphone on it. Miller raises
his hand, REVEALING a smoldering JOINT."|stage direction

10||"He takes a long and awkward hit from the joint and bursts
into a coughing fit.
The scientists begin to scribble profusely as their
devices blink manically. General Brat and Agent Black
Suit exchange a concerned look. The General lights a
cigarette as the Scientist steps up to a small microphone
in the corner."|stage direction
11||(into microphone)|location
12|SCIENTIST|"Private Miller, we are now going to ask
you several questions. How do you feel?"|speech

question."|speech

snubs out the joint. He then pulls out a small leather
kit and sifts through it's contents: handi-wipes, hand
sanitizer, a little vial of cologne, Visine, mouthwash
and breath mints.
Dale vigorously wipes his hands, face, and mouth with wet
naps and then starts futilely attempting to put visine in
his blazing red eyes. Frustrated, he squirts Visine all
over his finger tips and simply rubs them into his eyes.
He uses the mouthwash, chews up a mint, dabs on some
cologne, and then gets out of the car."|stage direction
