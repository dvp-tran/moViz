ESTABLISHING SHOT OF A CAPE COD HOSPITAL - NIGHT
Rick and Fred come SKIDDING UP to the EMERGENCY ENTRANCE
followed by the two police cruisers. When they stop, we see
that somebody has spray-painted 'HORNY OLD MAN' on the side
of the mini-van.

the front doors, he gets KNOCKED VIOLENTLY to the ground.

LONG BEAT."|speech
31|RICK|"Well, uh, I don't appreciate that

YEAR-OLD BABY in one arm and a basket of laundry in the

mommy hair. She's wearing SWEATPANTS, an OVERSIZED T-SHIRT,

go out at least six nights a week
without the kids.
Maggie GIGGLES."|speech
44|RICK (CONT'D)|"I'm serious. We should go out every

A BEAUTIFUL BLONDE walks past them and Rick gives a QUICK

Maggie pulls away."|speech

GRACE (O.S.)
Come on, we're late!
REVERSE ANGLE reveals Fred Searing and his wife GRACE, 38,
waiting outside a restaurant. Fred sports a full-head of
hair that's maybe a little too stiff. Grace is short and
appealing in a Rachel Ray kind of way. Fred leans in to kiss
Maggie as Rick kisses Grace."|speech
54|MAGGIE|"Grace, let me ask you something:
Does Fred ever check out other
women in front of you?"|speech

The BARTENDER delivers a couple beers and Rick pays."|speech
62|RICK|"The girl walked past and I glanced
back at her for like half a second."|speech
63|FRED|"There's your problem, dumb-ass--
it's the wrong order. You don't
wait for the girl to walk past and
then glance back. You turn when
she's still fifteen feet in front
of you...then you wait for her to
walk into your line of vision.
Fred NOTICES an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN walking toward them from the
right."|speech
64|FRED (CONT'D)|"Observe.
Before the woman reaches them, Fred turns to his left and
holds the look until the Attractive Woman's ASS ENTERS HIS
VIEW and he watches her walk away."|speech

butt walks where I'm already
looking."|speech

71|RICK|"What am I, a vulture? Nah, I don't
go after the divorcee business
unless they approach me first."|speech
72|FRED|"Yeah, it's kind of tacky, huh?
As the guys crane their necks to get a better view of Missy's
ass, we...
REVERSE ANGLE to reveal Maggie, Grace and Dr. Lucy sipping
lemondrops and watching Rick and Fred from across the room."|speech
73|GRACE|"Look at those two meatheads
checking out Missy Frankenfield.
What, do they think they're
invisible over there?"|speech
74|MAGGIE|"I thought you said Fred wasn't a
gawker."|speech
75|GRACE|"He was standing right next to you.
I can't let him know that I know--
that would take all the fun out of
it."|speech
76|(CHUCKLES)|"You should see him. He's got some
stupid move where he looks back
before the girl passes to make it
seem like he couldn't help but
notice her ass. It's pathetic.

party. You can dust stay in bed,,
get your beauty sleep, and bask in
the sweet, sweet pounding I'm about

there with their 4-year-old, Gunnar."|speech

down the air--I'm a little chilly.
Look--I got goose bumps.
As she HOLDS OUT HER ARM to show him the GOOSE-BUMPS, we

PIERCING THROUGH HER SHEER TOP like small tents.
BACK ON Rick as his EYES GO WIDE WITH TERROR and he looks
away.

college. You drank when you were in
college, didn't you?
10."|speech
111|RICK|Well, uh...|speech
112|PAIGE|"Besides, it's so arbitrary. How
does it make sense that twenty's
old enough to fight in Iraq or
watch a porno movie, but it's too
young to drink a beer?
Rick shifts in his seat."|speech

uh...?"|speech

117|PAIGE (CONT'D)|"Look, I promise no one's gonna find
out. If you want, you can join me
down at the lake--we'll listen to
some tunes and have a couple beers.

seems amused by it."|speech

123|"COME ON--
RICK"|"No, Paige.

What are you thinking? I'm a

college girl?

She seems taken aback."|speech

other thing, I don't like the fact
that my daughter needs someone to

have permission."|speech
