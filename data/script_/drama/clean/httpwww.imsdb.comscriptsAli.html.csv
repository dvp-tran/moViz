roar he inspires, somewhere over there. And all of a sudden,
Cassius turns to face the angry man who wishes him death.
Cassius rocks left and right, like a tough kid on a corner

boasting. Instead, there is only Cassius' stare. The

LISTON
right away throws a left that misses and attacks Cassius,
throwing seven more that Cassius with extreme, awkward
caution evades.
He is fearful of the monster whose punches he has yet to
feel. Nevertheless, he does his job: measure Liston's
range and speed. Then, a body shot catches him above the
heart. Cassius feels the real power of Liston. It could
stop your heart's beating. He survives. Then...
CASSIUS
throws his long left jab. It keeps Liston at a set distance.
He has Liston's range, now, and he dances away from Liston's
charges. Then, halfway through the round, Cassius' eyes
have hunted out an opportunity, and he throws his first
combination with a few hard shots that, to Liston's surprise,
rock Liston's head back. And, then, Cassius easily evades...
LISTON'S
furious big misses to the left and right."|stage direction||
195||15.|unknown||
196||"CASSIUS
keeps tagging Liston with his long left. And, now,
infuriates Liston even more by merely walking away from
Liston's big misses, provoking even wilder and more
inaccurate Liston assaults. (We're aware that any Liston
shot could knock out Cassius if it connected.) Then Cassius
soaks up a couple of body shots, most flicks his jab, slides,
dances, clinches, circles away...UNTIL...
AT THE END OF THE ROUND
Cassius launches a second combination, slams a couple of big
lefts Liston's way that rock his head back two times.
Liston's so furious, he flips, charging Cassius, who hits
and ducks at the same time. The BELL RINGS THREE TIMES
