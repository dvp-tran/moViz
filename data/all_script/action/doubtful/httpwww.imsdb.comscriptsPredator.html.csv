As we slowly DESCEND through the varied shades of blue

OTHER-WORLDLY OBJECT drops INTO VIEW, backlit by the

the rising heat of the jungle.
Continuing to approach, the shimmering object resolves
into a MILITARY ASSAULT HELICOPTER, its rotors strobing
in the fading sunlight.  Drawing closer, the SOUND of
powerful TURBINES, throbbing in the heavy air, becomes
dominant, overpowering.
Guided by COLORED SMOKE and LANDING LIGHTS, the chopper

shouting directions to dozens of LATIN AMERICAN SOLDIERS
who stand by to assist the landing helicopter and to
load EQUIPMENT into the other choppers.
Inside the chopper, one man remains, stretched out against  *
the bulkhead, as if asleep.  He stirs, sits up, lighting    *
up a CIGAR.  With fatigue showing in his motion, he leans   *
forward, descending to the ground.                          *
A JEEP pulls to stop, the man swinging casually into the    *
front seat, tossing his GEAR into the rear.  With a         *
lurch the jeep heads out towards the command post.          *
In the doorway TWO MEN solemnly watch as the jeep
approaches.  Reaching the command post the man alights
from the jeep, heading towards the two men.
Into the pool of light cast by the fixture above the
door steps MAJOR ALAN SCHAEFER, the team leader, 38, an
intelligent and intense man.  He informally salutes,
GENERAL H.L. PHILIPS, 55, hardened, close-cropped graying

incredibly dense vegetation, ripping aside the heavy
growth, plunging onward.
Before him, covering a narrow passageway, is a huge
SPIDER WEB, intricate, four feet across.  Schaefer
starts to sweep aside the web.  With a sharp intake
of breath, he halts, inches from the wed.  Something
is wrong.
Examining the web closer he sees not silken threads
but a hard and shiny network of HAIR-FINE WIRE: A TRAP.
He backs up, picking up a hefty branch from the ground.
He swings the branch with a mighty heave, clenching
his teeth in pain.  The branch sails end over end
into the web impacting the strands.  A metallic SNAP
is HEARD; a high-pitches WHINE and the log is violently
severed, the pieces flying in opposite directions with

SKINNED BODIES, some lying on the ground, others hung
from the trees, like Hopper and his men were.
He turns back, SEEING the Hunter as he passes through
