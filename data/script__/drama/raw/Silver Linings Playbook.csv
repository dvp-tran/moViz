didn't. He's sixty-five years old.

you hurt him as well."|speech

for me to get your letter, as I'm
sure you can imagine, but I'm glad
you took the risk of discreetly
getting it to me through Tiffany.
This gives us a chance to
communicate while I keep the
restraining order until I feel
safe. I must admit you sound
terrific and I'm happy that you are
feeling so positive and becoming a
more loving and caring man, which I
always knew you were. I was moved
to read about `Excelsior' and your
belief in happy endings. I am also
moved by your act of love to read
the books I have taught at the high
school. I'm sorry you find them so
negative, but I disagree. I think
they are great works of art that
reflect how hard life can be and
they can also help kids prepare
themselves for the hardness of
life. In spite of all these
positive developments, Pat, I have
to say if it's me reading the
signs, I need to see something to
prove you are ready to resume our
marriage. Otherwise I find myself
thinking that we might both be
better off moving on with our lives
separately. Please don't react
quickly to this, but take time to
think about it. I'm glad you're
doing so well. Love, Nikki."""|speech
