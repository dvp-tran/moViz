2|"People do not give it credence that a young girl could leave
home and go off in the wintertime to avenge her father's
blood, but it did happen."|stage direction
3|"I was just fourteen years of age when a coward by the name
of Tom Chaney shot my father down in Fort Smith,
Arkansas, and robbed him of his life and his horse and two
California gold pieces that he carried in his trouser band."|stage direction
4|"Papa was a Cumberland Presbyterian and a Mason. He'd
hired Chaney--for paid wages, not on shares--when Chaney
was ""down on his luck."" If Papa had a failing it was his
kindly disposition; I did not get my mean streak from him."|stage direction
5|"He had taken Chaney up to Fort Smith to help lead back a
string of mustang ponies he'd just bought from a stock trader
named Stonehill. In town, Chaney had fallen to drink and
cards, and lost all his money. He got it into his head he'd
been cheated and went back to the boarding house for his
Henry rifle. Papa remonstrated, and Chaney shot him in the
breast."|stage direction
6|2|unknown
7|"Chaney fled. He could have taken the time to saddle the
horse--or hitched up three spans of mules to a Concord
stagecoach and smoked a pipe, as it seems that no one in that
city was inclined to give chase. Chaney had mistaken its
citizens for men."|location

9|"You might say, what business was it of my father's to
meddle? My answer is this: he was trying to do that short
devil a good turn. He was his brother's keeper. Does that

for the Territory. I would think he has throwed in with
Lucky Ned Pepper, whose gang robbed a mail hack
yesterday on the Poteau River."|stage direction
62|Mattie|unknown
63|Why are you not looking for him?|stage direction
64|Sheriff|unknown
65|"I have no authority in the Indian Nation. Tom Chaney is the
business of the U.S. marshals now."|stage direction
66|Mattie|unknown
67|When will they arrest him?|stage direction
68|Sheriff|unknown
69|"Not soon I am afraid. The marshals are not well staffed and,
I will tell you frankly, Chaney is at the end of a long list of"|stage direction

72|Mattie|unknown
73|Could I hire a marshal to pursue Tom Chaney?|stage direction
74|Sheriff|unknown
75|You have a lot of experience with bounty hunters?|stage direction

settle my father's affairs."|stage direction

79|All alone?|stage direction
80|Mattie|unknown
81|"I am the person for it. Mama was never any good at sums
and she can hardly spell cat. I intend to see papa's killer
hanged."|stage direction
82|Sheriff|unknown
83|"I see. Well. Nothing prevents you from offering a reward,
or from so informing a marshal. It would have to be real
money, though, to be persuasive. Chaney is across the river
in the Choctaw Nation--lawless country. It will not be a
daisy-picking expedition. Upwards of three-score US
marshals have been slaughtered in the Territory."|stage direction
84|Mattie|unknown
85|I will see to the money. Who's the best marshal?|stage direction
86|Sheriff|unknown
87|"I would have to weigh that proposition. I reckon William
Waters is the best tracker. He is half Comanche and it is
something to see him cut for sign. The meanest one is
Rooster Cogburn. He is a pitiless man, double tough and
fear don't enter into his thinking. He loves to pull a cork.
The best is probably L.T. Quinn, he brings his prisoners in
alive. He may let one get by now and again but he believes
even the worst of men is entitled to a fair shake. Quinn is a
good peace officer and a lay preacher to boot. He will not
plant evidence or abuse a prisoner. He is as straight as
string. Yes, I will say Quinn is about the best they have."|stage direction

we are doing all right in Little Rock. I am Mattie Ross,
daughter of Frank Ross."|stage direction

manly qualities. He was a close trader but he acted the
gentleman."|stage direction

bought."|location

shipped to you at my earliest convenience."|location
136|Mattie|unknown
137|We don't want the ponies now. We don't need them.|location
138|Stonehill|unknown
139|"Well that hardly concerns me. Your father bought those five
ponies and paid for them and there is an end of it. I have the
bill of sale."|location

141|"And I want three hundred dollars for Papa's saddle horse that
was stolen from your stable."|location
142|Stonehill|unknown

horse."|location
144|Mattie|unknown

are responsible."|location
146|Stonehill|unknown
147|"I admire your sand but I believe you will find that I am not
liable for such claims."|location
148|Mattie|unknown
149|"You were custodian. If you were a bank and were robbed
you could not simply tell the depositors to go hang."|location
150|Stonehill|unknown
151|"I do not entertain hypotheticals, the world as it is is vexing
enough. Secondly, your valuation of the horse is high by
about two hundred dollars. How old are you?"|location
152|"12
Mattie"|unknown
153|"If anything my price is low. Judy is a fine racing mare. She
has won purses of twenty-five dollars; I have seen her jump
an eight-rail fence with a heavy rider. I am fourteen."|stage direction
154|Stonehill|unknown
155|"Hmm. Well, that's all very interesting. The ponies are
yours, take them. Your father's horse was stolen by a
murderous criminal. I had provided reasonable protection
for the creature as per our implicit agreement. My watchman
had his teeth knocked out and can take only soup. We must
each bear his own misfortunes."|stage direction
156|Mattie|unknown
157|I will take it to law.|stage direction

Victoria and my brother Little Frank."|stage direction

accountable."|stage direction

rest easy on that score. You can confirm any agreement by
telegraph."|stage direction

bargain further. I will take the ponies back and keep the gray
horse which is mine and settle for three hundred dollars.
Now you must take that or leave it and I do not much care
which it is."|location
184|Mattie|unknown
185|"Lawyer Daggett would not wish me to consider anything
under three hundred twenty-five dollars. But I will settle for
three hundred and twenty if I am given the twenty in
advance. And here is what I have to say about the saddle--"|location

Mr. Goudy
Let us restrict it to ""killed"" so that we may have a
manageable figure.
Cogburn
Around twelve or fifteen. Stopping men in flight, defending
myself, et cetera.
Mr. Goudy
Around twelve or fifteen. So many that you cannot keep a
precise count. Remember, you are under oath. I have
examined the records and can supply the accurate figure."|unknown

I believe them two Whartons make twenty-three.

Twenty-three dead men in four years.

have you killed?

368|LeBoeuf|unknown
369|That's right. I am a Texas Ranger.|stage direction
370|Mattie|unknown
371|"That may make you a big noise in that state; in Arkansas you
should mind that your Texas trappings and title do not make
you an object of fun. Why have you been ineffectually
pursuing Chaney?"|stage direction
372|LeBoeuf|unknown
373|"He shot and killed a state senator named Bibbs down in
Waco, Texas. The Bibbs family have put out a reward."|stage direction
374|Mattie|unknown
375|How came Chaney to shoot a state senator?|stage direction
376|LeBoeuf|unknown
377|"My understanding is there was an argument about a dog. Do
you know anything about where Chaney has gone?"|stage direction
378|Mattie|unknown
379|"He is in the Territory, and I hold out little hope for you
earning your bounty."|stage direction
380|LeBoeuf|unknown
381|Why is that?|stage direction
382|Mattie|unknown
383|My man will beat you to it. I have hired a deputy marshal,|stage direction
384|29|unknown
385|"the toughest one they have, and he is familiar with the Lucky Ned Pepper
gang that they say Chaney has tied up with."|stage direction
386|LeBoeuf|unknown
387|Well, I will throw in with you and your marshal.|stage direction
388|Mattie|unknown
389|No. Marshal Cogburn and I are fine.|stage direction
390|LeBoeuf|unknown
391|"It'll be to our mutual advantage. Your marshal I presume
knows the Territory; I know Chaney. It is at least a two-man
job taking him alive."|stage direction

It is just a turkey shoot. There was one time in New Mexico,

was being pursued by seven men. I turned Bo around and
taken the reins in my teeth and rode right at them boys firing
them two navy sixes I carry on my saddle. Well I guess they
was all married men who loved their families as they
scattered and run for home.
Mattie
That is hard to believe.
Rooster
What is?
Mattie
One man riding at seven.
Rooster
It is true enough. You go for a man hard enough and fast
enough and he don't have time to think about how many is
with him--he thinks about himself and how he may get clear
of the wrath that is about to set down on him.
Mattie
Why were they pursuing you?
Rooster
They was in the nature of a posse.
Mattie
You were particeps criminis in something other than the case
