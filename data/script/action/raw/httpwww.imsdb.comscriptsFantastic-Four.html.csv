CLOSE ON A MASSIVE STEEL HEAD
Our first thought: DR. DOOM?  But it's not moving.  A
welder's torch sparks into frame in the hands of a sculptor
on scaffolding.  This is art, an epic 20 foot statue going up
of a business mogul (VICTOR VON DOOM) in whose generously
extended hands sit two intertwined columns of DNA.  His face
is chiseled, angular, perfect (too perfect).  Past sparks, we
MOVE down to pick up..."|stage direction

my toys... Tell me: if NASA doesn't
trust you, why should I?"|speech

could save lives."|speech

enough to keep the lights on, isn't

factored them into my coordinates and --"|speech

together."|speech

can handle the biogenetics, and I'll
focus on the molecular physics.  Or,

have some background in electropho--"|speech

perfectly timed with the shuttle LIFTING OFF.
