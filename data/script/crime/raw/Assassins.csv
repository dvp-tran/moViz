PERFECT SQUARE OF BLACK
We know that we are looking at something because its
polished surface shimmers with light.
PULLING BACK, other squares are revealed; the black and
white tiles of a chess board.
The board rises and spins, slipping beneath us we find
ourselves MOVING ACROSS the board, MOVING THROUGH a chess
game.
The pieces are everywhere, checking and covering other
pieces.  It has reached that critical moment when pieces
are traded and the board begins to clear as two strategies
unravel towards a final outcome.
Standing above the pieces around him, we see the black
king.
We MOVE CLOSER TOWARDS his face, CLOSER TO his chiseled
ebony features, CLOSER UNTIL we are staring into his cold
black eyes..."|stage direction

4||EXT. MARSH - SUNGLASSES - DUSK|location
5||"The red setting sun is reflected in the black lens.
Two men are tromping through the calf-deep mud of an end-
less marsh.  It is fall, the first frost not far away and
the foliage is brown and bare.  With the red-orange ball
of fire melting into the horizon, the two men at first
appear as only silhouettes or shadows slogging through the
mire.
The man with the sunglasses walks behind the other man.
He is very well-dressed in a dark suit.  A .22 caliber
gun, fitted with a long silencer, dangles from his hand.
His name is ROBERT RATH.
The other man is WILLIE KETCHAM.  He is also wearing a
very expensive suit though it is being destroyed by the
brambles and mud.
As he lifts his foot his Gucci shoe is sucked off by the
mud."|stage direction
6|KETCHAM|Aw-shit!|speech
7||"He balances on one leg, holding his silk-socked foot in
the air.  He looks at the shoe, already filling with mud.
He looks at Rath."|stage direction
8|KETCHAM|How much farther?|speech
9|RATH|"Just a little ways.  Up to those
trees."|speech
10||"About a half mile further into the thickening marsh there
is a small cluster of trees."|stage direction
11|KETCHAM|Oh, fuck it.|speech
12||"He pulls his sock off and plunges his foot into the mud.
He smiles.  It feels good.  He hurls the sock.  Lifting
his other foot he pulls his shoe off and hurls that.  He
grabs for the other sock, struggling to get it off,
laughing at himself as he slips and falls into the mud.
Rath waits, a faint smile.
He manages to get the sock off and then stands digging
both feet into the dark, wet earth."|stage direction
13|KETCHAM|Hey, this feels kinda good.|speech
14||"They move on, Ketcham almost playing, sinking his feet
deep pulling them out to make a SPLURCHING, SUCKING NOISE."|stage direction
15|KETCHAM|"Hey, do you mind if I talk a
little?  I feel like, I don't
know, talking I guess."|speech
16|RATH|Sure.|speech
17|KETCHAM|"Funny, I've never been a talker.
My wife was always getting on me
about that.  'Say what you feel,
tell me what's bothering you,
you ve got to talk to me.'  I
never would though.  Not really."|speech
18||RATH|unknown
19|KETCHAM|Why not?|speech
20||KETCHAM|unknown
21|KETCHAM|"I don't know.  Part of me wanted
to but part of me always said,
'What's she going to be able to
do?'  I don't know.  Maybe I
didn't trust her."|speech
22||"He picks up a handful of mud and begins shaping it like a
snowball."|stage direction
23|KETCHAM|"My Margaret... I loved her but you
know what?  I cheated on her.  All
the time.  I don't even know why.
It wasn't the sex, Margaret was
great in bed.  I think if I wasn't
married I wouldn't have even looked
at some of those women.  I knew she
couldn't trust me, so how could I
trust her?  If she was here right
now I'd think that I would tell her
that I was sorry... 'course, if she
were here right now, maybe I
wouldn't feel like talking."|speech

26|RATH|It's possible.|speech
27|KETCHAM|You're pretty famous aren't you?|speech
28|RATH|I hope not.|speech
29|KETCHAM|"I know this may seem like a strange
question, but can I ask you how
much the contract was for -- not
to insult you or anything, I know
you're a professional, but just
for me, I was just wondering."|speech
30|RATH|It's a common question.|speech
31|KETCHAM|"Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to
see that price tag.  Like art,
right?  You hang some painting
that looks like baby-puke in your
living room only if it costs a
bundle."|speech
32|RATH|A dime.|speech
33|KETCHAM|"One hundred thousand?  That's it?
Jesus... Is that a lot?"|speech
34|RATH|Average.|speech
35|KETCHAM|Shit... oh well.|speech
36||Ketcham laughs.|stage direction
37|KETCHAM|"I have been thinking about this
for a long while.  I knew this day
was coming.  I knew someday
someone would make the call on me.
I never thought about anyone that
I had whacked.  What do you call
it anyway?"|speech
38|RATH|Taken.|speech
39|KETCHAM|"'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had
someone taken I would call our
General Contractor, transfer the
money and as soon as I hung up the
phone I forgot about them."|speech
40|RATH|"Everyone who plays the game knows
the rules."|speech
41|KETCHAM|That's exactly what I told myself.|speech
42||"Ketcham laughs again.  He is getting kind of giggly, like
he's high."|stage direction
43|KETCHAM|"I always wondered what I'd be
thinking at this exact moment.  I
imagined that I would be thinking
about the fucker who contracted
this, trying to figure out who
it was..."|speech
44||Something occurs to him and he looks back at Rath.|stage direction
45|RATH|Don't know.  That's how it works.|speech
46|KETCHAM|"That's what our General Contractor
told us but how can you trust
someone like that?"|speech
47|RATH|Right.|speech
48|KETCHAM|"I thought that I would be thinking
about Margaret, or work, or that
I'd be having these deep, profound
and depressing thoughts but I'm
not.  I'm trying to think really
profound thoughts, but I can't.
It seems very funny to me."|speech
49|RATH|What are you thinking about?|speech
50|KETCHAM|"I'm thinking about Moonpies.  Ain't
that funny?  I haven't had a
Moonpie since I was ten years old.
Right now, I'm thinking how much
I'd love one."|speech

stops laughing.  They are nearly to the cluster of trees."|stage direction

56||He looks at the trees, his voice dying in the WIND.|stage direction
57|RATH|"Everyone handles it differently.
Some are ready, some are not."|speech
58|KETCHAM|"Do they get down on their knees,
begging and crying?"|speech
59|RATH|Some.|speech
60|KETCHAM|"When I thought about this, that
was always there, in the back of
my head, that image of me on my
knees, crying.  It wouldn't go
away and it would really upset me.
It was something that I could never
get away from... but now, I feel
it's okay.  I feel good."|speech
61|RATH|Can I ask you a question?|speech
62|KETCHAM|Anything.|speech
63|RATH|Why didn't you fade?|speech

65|RATH|You mean quit?|speech
66||RATH|unknown
67|RATH|Yeah.|speech
68||KETCHAM|unknown
69|RATH|"I used to think about it.  I had
Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I
thought about moving somewhere
far away like, Europe.  I could
see all of that, the first part,
the getting away but I couldn't
see that next part.  'Then what?'
So I'd stop thinking about it and
go back to work.  You understand?"|speech
70|RATH|Yeah.|speech
71||"Ketcham smiles and looks around at the grove of birch
trees."|stage direction
72|KETCHAM|"I always pictured that I would end
in some land fill, under
someone else's garbage.  I kept
picturing those plastic diapers
filled with some baby's green shit,
covering me.  But this is nice..."|speech

horizon."|stage direction

the sun set in a million years.
Do you mind?"|speech
76|RATH|No.|speech
77||Ketcham stares at the last of the light.|stage direction
78|KETCHAM|Nice... real nice.|speech
79||"With his face hidden from Rath he begins to cry.
Rath watches Ketcham staring at the setting sun.  Rath
looks down at the gun limply held in his hand.
When the sun is gone, a red glow at the bottom of a dark-
ening sky, we hear the GUN, SILENCED, ONCE, then the BODY
FALLING INTO THE MUD.  After a beat we hear TWO MORE
SHOTS.
Ketcham is lying face down, already sinking into the mud,
a red cloud mushrooming around his head like the red haze
left by the dying sun.
Rath breathes in deep and lets the air out slowly, stand-
ing alone in the middle of nowhere."|stage direction

A man is standing at a wall of windows that glow from the
amber wash of urban light.
Snow is falling, heavy white flakes glittering in the
city's electric night.
The man finishes his bourbon, ICE CLINKING in the empty
glass.  He is slightly drunk and he sways forward until
his forehead rests against the window.
In the dim light, we recognize the man as Rath.
Outside there is a beautiful stone church decorated for
Christmas.  He watches the snowflakes drift to the
distant street below.
He is wondering what it would feel like to let himself
fall, when there is a KNOCK at the door.
Crossing the room, he opens the door.  Backlit by the
bright hallway light is a WOMAN.  She has already removed
her coat and though she is only a silhouette we can see

same positions as in the opening sequence.
He rubs at the whiskers that have darkened his face and
then finishes off another bottle of bourbon.
He flings the empty bottle across the room as he reaches
over the board and moves one of white knights, taking a
black rook.
A sequence begins, obvious, and he works through it moving
both the black and white pieces.  Suddenly he stops.  He
gets up and shifts to the other side of the board,

Another sequence emerges and he trades the pieces through
it as he moves around the table, returning to his place

The dinner crowd is a mix of yuppies and older Italian
families who have been eating here for years.
Rath is sitting alone at a booth.  With very subtle
changes to his appearance, he looks like an older Italian.
In front of him is a glass and a carafe of dark red wine.
He touches neither of them.  His eyes shift as he studies
the room.
LEEVIO VALLI pushes into the restaurant surrounded by five
gorillas in Italian suits.  The owner hurries to greet
them, hugging, kissing, speaking only Italian.
The entourage moves through the restaurant to the over-
sized booth in the back.
Rath does not look twice at them.  Immediately he is
watching everyone else, looking for the other assassin.
Leevio slides into the booth as his goons stand and sit
around the table, obscuring him from all parts of the
room.
A wine steward immediately brings a bottle of red wine and
fills their glasses.  A pretty waitress sets a steaming
loaf of garlic bread out and a giant bowl of minestrone in
front of Leevio.  He tells her something and she giggles.
They joke in Italian, watching her ass as she wiggles back
to the kitchen.
At Leevio's table the wine steward returns to fill their
glasses.
It is the goon standing against the wall that is the first
to realize that it is not the same wine steward.  He is
the second assassin, much younger than Rath.  His name is
BAIN.  He smiles.
The goon reaches for his gun as --
Bain SHATTERS the BOTTLE of wine into his face.  He
screams.

shoot you."|speech

you.  And we will both need money."|speech

To survive, you have to go into deep
hiding.  And that's going to take
money, a lot of money."|speech

just walk out that door --"|speech

still come after you."|speech

He'll come for you and he'll find
you."|speech
786|ELECTRA|"You don't know that -- you're trying
to scare me."|speech
787|RATH|"No.  It's the truth.  I know what
you are.  Like me, like Bain, you're
a ghost, you're not part of the real
world.  You don't have a social
security number.  You don't pay
taxes.  You've probably used ten
different names over the last ten
years.  A long time ago something
probably happened, something illegal
and you ran, you disappeared and it
was easy.  You think you can do it
again.  But I'm telling you, fading
from the law is nothing.  No matter
what you do, where you go, I swear
to you that Bain will find you."|speech
788|ELECTRA|How?|speech
789|RATH|"Right now, as we sit here, he is
tearing through your apartment.  He
is digging through your drawers,
emptying your closets.  He will take
your telephone and address books,
your appointment books.  If you keep
a diary, he is reading it.  He'll go
into the kitchen and find out what
kind of food you eat, liquor you
drink, cigarettes you smoke.  In the
bathroom he will find any
prescription drugs you take and
where you get them filled.  If you
have video tape or recordings he
will watch and listen to all of
them."|speech

ready to explode."|stage direction

Everything.  I know, because I've
done it.  Once you've been inside a

If you're any good, you'll find the
mark in a week, and Bain is good
because I was the best and I
couldn't take him."|speech

private sector is that a General

There is more BUMPING and THUMPING, the WOMAN LAUGHING and

his ears.
He is tearing open a long box wrapped in ""Happy Birthday""

Inside the box is a massive black hi-tech assault rifle.
He smiles.
He assembles it quickly, snapping it together with
automatic ease.  When the sight is tightened in place, he
jumps up.
In the mirror over the dresser, he poses down with the
gun.
Not satisfied, he grabs his shades and checks himself
again.  He starts moving with the music, playing with the
gun, first as a guitar, then whipping it around, spinning
it expertly, like a drum and bugle corpsman.  The gun zips
and flashes around as he whirls in place, then freezes.
The butt of the rifle to his shoulder, he peers down the
scope at his own head reflected in the mirror.  He is
sweating and breathing, but the barrel does not move."|stage direction

Screaming, she leaps out of the room, into the hall.
His shoulders oozing blood, Bain clenches his teeth and
rises, listening as --
She sprints for the stairs at the far end of the hall.
Beneath, he moves to the railing and aims at the
staircase, waiting, until --
Electra freezes at the top of the stairs, realizing that
they are exposed.
She flashes her head, quickly dipping back as the WALL is
PERFORATED with BULLETS."|stage direction

doing?  I don't believe this is
happening!"|speech
1546||"She can hear him coming, his voice ECHOING through the
hollow building.  She looks down the stairs, the hall,
above; there is nowhere to go."|stage direction
1547|BAIN|"You're dead!  You're fucking dead!
I'm going to kill you a hundred
fucking times for this!"|speech
1548||"Bain FIRES up at the ceiling, the BULLET tearing through
the floor, WHIZZING past Electra's head.  If she moves
he'll know her position.
He FIRES another.
Electra sinks down, her back against the wall and aims at
the floor.
Another SHOT.
She FIRES back.
Bain closes, as they both start FIRING, silenced WEAPONS,
flashing, PUMPING LEAD at unseen targets.
Her gun empties first.
He laughs hearing the CLICK."|stage direction

1550|RATH|Bain!|speech
1551||"Rath's scream ECHOES up through the building.
Before Bain can target him, Rath is gone; a shadow, a
ghost.  He scans the hotel's courtyard.  The last light
from the setting sun slips through the slits, cracks and
broken window panes, casting patterns; a surreal dream-
like grid resembling a chess board.
Electra sees her chance.  She leaps to her feet, throwing
the gun over the balcony.
The two men watch the GUN CLATTER to the floor as she
races back to the room."|stage direction
1552|BAIN|Fuck no!|speech

the fifth floor.  Rath pulls the trigger and finds the gun
is empty."|stage direction

Rath sees it all happening."|stage direction

Electra is flying toward the door, her feet hardly

TELESCOPIC SIGHT
When the cross-hairs find her back.

1561||"Bain FIRES.
Electra dives.
The blackened DOOR JAMB SPLINTER-BURSTS in front of her.
She bounces, scrambling on all fours into the room.
Bain hurries down the hall after her as Rath bolts for the
stairs.
Seeing Rath exposed on the stairs, Bain whips around and
FIRES, the WALL SHREDDING behind Rath as he dives back
down into the shadows.
Ripping open Bain's duffel bag Electra grabs Bain's .22.
Bain advances steadily, the rifle trained on the door.
Inside the room Electra grunts, hurling the duffel bag out
the door.  It spins over the balcony and plummets to the
ground and bursts open.
A GUN CLIP SKITTERS across the stone tile coming to rest
in the middle of the courtyard.
Rath and Bain both see it.
Staying hidden, Rath immediately circles towards it.
Bain sweats, looking at the door, down at the clip, then
back at the door.  Something's got to give.
Unsure what to do Electra waits, the gun clenched between
her two hands, covering the empty, dark space of the door.
Bain makes his choice, moving towards room 502.
Rath sees that Bain is going after Electra.  He takes a
slow breath and tears from the shadows --
Bolting into the open, Rath is focused wholly on the clip,
the ground a blur beneath him --
Bain reacts; the rifle swings, rushing, arcing after Rath.
Two more steps and Rath dives, sliding, snagging the clip
as --
The RIFLE SPITS --
Rath screams, his leg erupting with blood.
TELESCOPIC SIGHT
The scope glides up zeroing the back of Rath's head.
BACK TO SCENE
Rath rams the clip in place."|stage direction
1562|BAIN|Game --|speech
1563||"Bain squeezes the trigger --
CLICK -- the rifle is empty.  Bain screams in disbelief.
Rolling over, Rath jacks back the slide and sights the
balcony but Bain is gone.
Electra searches the room for a way out.  Keeping the gun
trained on the door she steps carefully over to the hole
that Bain fell through.
Grimacing, Rath struggles to his feet."|stage direction
1564|RATH|Electra!|speech
1565||"Bain explodes through the wall, charred wood and plaster
flying.
Electra spins to shoot but the FLOOR suddenly CRACKS OPEN,
swallowing her.
Limping, lurching up the stairs, Rath hears the CRASH.
Jarred by the fall, Electra drags herself away from the
open ceiling."|stage direction
1566|RATH|"The gun!  He needs the gun!  Get rid
of it!  Throw it!"|speech
1567||"She looks up for Bain but he has again disappeared.  She
looks at the gun, thinking, turning it over in her hands.
His leg soaked with blood, Rath rumbles down the hall.
Black with soot, Bain descends soundless, serpent-like to
the fourth level through another burned opening.
Electra moves towards the door aiming at every sound, at
every dark corner.  She is almost there when we see Bain,
a shadow coming to life, emerging behind her.
Lumbering, Rath is halfway there, his eyes riveted on the
door to room 502.
Hearing Bain, Electra turns.  In one smooth motion, he
snatches her arm and breaks her wrist.  The gun falls.
Rath hears her scream.
Electra kicks at his groin but he drops, leg sweeping her
to the ground.
She gropes for the gun when he kicks her in the face,
jack-knifing her body back, knocking her unconscious.
Bain grabs the gun.
Rath whips into the room BLASTING --
BULLETS CHASING Bain as he disappears into a blackened
hole.
Rath goes to Electra not knowing if she is alive or dead.
Gently he turns her, cradling her head, her face, smeared
with blood.
From within the labyrinth, Rath hears BAIN begin to LAUGH."|stage direction

Bain whirls INTO VIEW, his gun whipping around to Rath who
turns too slow.
Bain pumps the trigger.  ONE CLICK.  ANOTHER.  And
ANOTHER.  The gun is empty."|stage direction

from the plaza.
A man and a woman emerge from the shadows of the alley
beside the boarded hotel.  Although they walk a bit slow,
leaning on one another, they become it seems, like just
another couple, arm in arm, holding tightly to each other
and to a very large suitcase."|stage direction
