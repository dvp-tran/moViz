Matrix slams the Blazer's hood...gets inside...puts his
weapons on the seat...then releases the brake. Then,
one hand on the wheel, the other on the door frame, he
begins to push the car.
He steers it not towards the dirt road, but towards the
shoulder where a steep incline leads downward. Since
the Blazer is pointed the wrong way, Matrix is pushing
it uphill-the effort is incredible... the veins on his
neck stand out...with a SCREAM, he puts everything he's
got into it... and finally it begins to roll downwards.
Matrix leaps in. Snaps on the driver's shoulder belt...
reaches over and wraps the passenger belt around his
body as well.
