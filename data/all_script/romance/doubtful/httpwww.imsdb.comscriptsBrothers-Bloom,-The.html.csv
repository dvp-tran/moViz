Written by"|unknown
1||"1   EXT. DIRT ROAD - SUNRISE                                      1
Dawn with her rose-red fingers rises over a dusty country
road. A car chugs over the horizon.
NARRATOR
As far as con man stories go,
I think I've heard them all.
Of grifters, ropers, faro fixers,
tales drawn long and tall.
But if one bears a bookmark in
the confidence man's tome,
twould be that of Penelope,
and of the brothers Bloom.
2   EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - MORNING                                  2
The car deposits two shabby boys (10 & 13) in front of a
country house.
Both in black.   Each with a suitcase.
NARRATOR
At ten and thirteen Bloom and
Stephen (the younger and the old)
3   INT. KITCHEN (FLASHBACK)                                      3
The two brothers and an oafish FOSTER FATHER sit eating
breakfast.
NARRATOR
had been through several foster
families.
The FOSTER FATHER slaps Bloom upside the head. Stephen
LAUNCHES across the table, tackling the dad and beating the
crap out of him.
NARRATOR (cont'd)
Thirty eight, all told.
4   INT. CHILD WELFARE OFFICE - DAY                               4
CLOSE ON - A CHILD WELFARE FILE COVER
""Bloom"" stamped on it. It opens, and dozens of reports flip
by. Under the ""REASON FOR RETURN OF MINORS"" field we catch
different entries: ""BEHAVIOR INAPPROPRIATE"", ""UNMANAGEABLE"",
""MOLESTED CAT"", ""SOLD OUR FURNITURE"", ""CAUSED FLOODING"".

NARRATOR
Mischief moved them on in life, and
moving kept them close.
5   EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE PORCH                                     5
The brothers on the porch, suitcases in hand.
NARRATOR
For Bloom had Stephen, Stephen
Bloom, and both had more than most.
The front door opens, and a pair of FOSTER PARENTS eye the
brothers suspiciously.
6   EXT. SMALL TOWN SQUARE - LATER THAT DAY                      6
A wide dusty Main Street, which the two brothers survey.
NARRATOR
Another home, another main street.
Stephen looked around,
then summed the burgh up thusly:
STEPHEN
Bloom, we've hit a one hat town.
NARRATOR
One theater. One car wash. One
cafe. One park. One cat. Which,
through some mishap, had one leg.
The cat sits on a roller skate, rowing itself down the street
with its one leg.
STEPHEN
Sweet Jesus. Look at that.
7   EXT. SCHOOL - DAY                                            7
A group of children flee the school joyfully.
NARRATOR
One school, which meant one tight-
knit group of local well-off kids.

8    EXT. CANDY SHOP                                                 8
The children run out of the candy store, all slurping Rocket
Pops.
NARRATOR
Their pocket-change bought rocket
pops,
9    INT. CANDY SHOP                                                 9
The brothers at the counter. Bloom watches the children go,
while Stephen counts out pennies.
NARRATOR
The brothers,
Stephen slaps the change down angrily and points with a
scowl.
STEPHEN
Pixie Stix.
10   EXT. PARK                                                   10
The children play, resplendent with their Rocket Pops.
NARRATOR
They were the `they'. All well
loved, rooted, happy as you please.
Bloom and Stephen sit off to the side of the park, none too
happy nursing their Pixie Stix.
NARRATOR (cont'd)
Always there. In every town.
Stephen glares, flicks the Stix away like a cigarette.
STEPHEN
The playground bourgeoisies.
He storms off.    Bloom lingers, staring silently at the
children.

11   EXT. FOREST                                                  11
The brothers amble down a wooded path.     Bloom stops, staring
into the trees.
Through the dense thicket of foliage... the children playing.
And one gleaming eye framed perfectly through a small open
patch in the leaves.
Bloom pushes the leaves aside. A girl. Golden curls.
Summer dress. Standing in the distance on a wide lawn.
Bloom gazes.    Stephen places his hand on Bloom's back.
12   EXT. PARK - CONTINUOUS                                       12
Bloom stumbles from the trees (very much as if he's been
shoved) and regains his footing and freezes, not shielded at
all now from the playing kids and the girl.
NARRATOR
Could he simply
STEPHEN (O.S.)
Talk to her!
NARRATOR
Just drop his fears and go? Leave
his brother in the woods, and join
the children?
The girl makes eye contact, twisting a daisy chain between
her tiny fingers. Bloom's adam apple convulses.
He turns tail and runs back into the woods."|unknown

13   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                         13
Brothers in bed. Bloom gazes window-ward. Stephen gazes Bloom-
wise, shuffling a pack of cards.

something through. So whatcha
thinking?"|speech
5|STEPHEN|Not a thing.|speech
6|NARRATOR|"This wasn't really true.
Cause in the root of Stephen's
psyche, something now began.
A seed of grand epiphany. A hook.
A tale."|speech

8|STEPHEN|A plan.|speech
9||"Stephen spreads out a hand-drawn flowchart on a stump, and
talks Bloom through it."|unknown
10|NARRATOR|"A fiction made for profit, in which
both boys played a part.
A simple con in fifteen steps."|speech
11|STEPHEN|And this is where we start.|speech
12||"Stephen runs his finger backwards down the connected boxes,
each neatly numbered, stopping at #1.... ""Bloom Talks To
Girl""
15   EXT. PARK - DAY                                                 15
Children and the gold haired Girl playing.      The wall of
foliage where the forest begins shimmers."|unknown
13|NARRATOR|"And then, as if a curtain had been
pulled back from the sky...
Some barrier within the younger
Bloom was broken."|speech
14||"Bloom bursts through the trees and strides across the wide
lawn, confident, glowing, stopping face to golden face with
the girl.

Stephen's story to a T."|speech

16   EXT. TOWN SQUARE                                             16
Bloom does indeed, sitting and laughing with a circle of
kids, suddenly a natural born charmer."|unknown
19|NARRATOR|"And being who he wasn't, could be
as he wished to be."|speech
20||"The Golden Girl smiles at him.
From the shadows of an adjacent alley, Stephen watches,
pleased. He slinks away.

Bloom enters, hears running water from the bathroom. He
glimpses down at the flowchart on the bed, scanning down to:
Box #10 - ""Bloom comes home to find Stephen filling the
coolers""
Stephen backs out of the bathroom trolling a heavy cooler.
STEPHEN
Oh - kay. How's it going on the
playground front?
BLOOM
It's great.

hangs in the mouth of the cave for a tantalizing moment, then
recedes deeper into the gloom.
With a cry the children, Bloom included, dash into the cave.

The light glows just around the next corner... the children
run after it, slipping in the mud, laughing, turning the
corner...
And the light glows just around the next corner. They
scramble, they slip and slide, they can't catch the light,
but they're all having the time of their lives.
Bloom included.    Holding the girl's hand, laughing, eyes full
of wonder.

parents holding 15 muddied kids by their ears.
NARRATOR
The children's parents, less so.
The Foster Parents exchange a glance.
QUICK SHOTS -
Stephen is smacked.
The wad of money is snatched from a grubby small hand by an
angry big one.

Two suitcases on a bed are snapped closed and pulled away.
The bed sits solid and vacant in the dusty afternoon
sunlight.
NARRATOR
A bitter ending? Maybe. But
there's sweetness in the mix.
Beneath the bed, forgotten, a piece of paper.    On it, the con
flow-chart. Numbered boxes.
NARRATOR (cont'd)
The brothers Bloom had found their
calling.
One of the boxes... number six...
NARRATOR (cont'd)
As shown in number six.

Sunday clothes hang, each tagged.
NARRATOR
`O'Henry's' was the town's one dry
clean shop.
And striding out of the store beneath the `O'Henry's
Cleaners' sign is Stephen, fifty dollars in hand, sucking a
Rocket Pop. The OWNER leans out of the door, looking a
little nervous. Stephen throws him back a salute.

Bloom sits against a wall, suitcases beside him. Boxes of
Rocket Pops, and one in each fist. Stephen plops down beside
him.
STEPHEN
So how's it feel?
Bloom's eye catches the children, and the girl, playing in
the distance.
NARRATOR
In truth, young Bloom won't know
for twenty years just how he felt.
HONK! A `Child Welfare' car waiting out on the street.    The
brothers pick themselves up.
NARRATOR (cont'd)
And so, we'll skip ahead now in our
story.
Stephen tosses his Rocket Pop.

nine months and a thousand years

it'll be as strangers. As for the
money... let it rot.
He exits, leaving McGuire stooped beside the crumpled form of
Victor. A long beat. The distant roar of an engine, tires
squealing.
Then through the smoky doorway steps a beautiful ASIAN WOMAN,
early 20s. She gives a nearly imperceptible nod.
MCGUIRE
Wow.
He pats Victor, who sits up, spitting blood. McGuire looks
to Victor and the woman for a reaction. Gets none.
MCGUIRE (cont'd)
Wow is the word you're both looking
for. Wow.
The Asian woman nods slightly.

A stately house in the middle of nowhere, on fire. Stephen

flaming house.

""Four months and a thousand years

A low, cozy basement level bar. A dozen people crowd it, all
expectant in a surprise-party type way.

A DWARF dances on the bar. Stephen plays cards with the
Turk, an ALBINO and a small crowd of character types.
THE TURK
Nine months, six countries, three
faked deaths, for one mark. You're

She flicks a champaign flute to make a `DING!' and mimes the
bullet bouncing off her.
THE TURK
Where is Bloom?
In the corner of the bar, in a private booth with drawn
velvet curtains, Bloom sits alone playing solitaire. Stuck
with a queen of hearts he can't play.
A beautiful woman in scarlet with auburn hair pokes her face
through the curtains.
ROSE

ROSE
Is it true?
BLOOM
What else did he tell you?
ROSE
I'm not going to tell it as good as
Stephen. You two kicked around
till your early teens, then stowed
away on a merchant marine freighter
and ended up in St. Petersburg,
where you spent five years under
the tutelage of a shadowy old
swindler named the Diamond Dog.
And he was your Fagin and Stephen
was his Artful Dodger, but it ended
suddenly and badly.
BLOOM
Stephen took his eye out with an
antique rapier.
ROSE
Why did he do that?
BLOOM
And then the Brothers Bloom lit out
on their own to make their fortune
as gentleman thieves. Sounds
romantic.
ROSE
It does.
She pushes the cards aside and slides clumsily onto the
table, her face inches from Bloom's, eyes closed, expecting a
kiss.
Bloom's eyes stay open.
BLOOM
You want to know how Stephen did
it? With Charleston?
ROSE
It's not the first thing on my
mind.

45   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          45
A replay of Bloom in front of the flaming bookshelf.
BLOOM (O.S.)
He positioned me in the same spot
where, seven years ago,
Charleston's wife stood and told
him she was leaving.
The room transforms, becomes daylit, not on fire, seven years
ago, a WIFE standing in Bloom's place.
BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
He chose my outfit to mirror her
suit.
Sure enough, the colors and shape of Bloom's suit matches the
Wife's outfit.
BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
He even phonetically matched my
final words to hers.
WIFE
This is the end. Charelston, you've
always been a dunce.
Everything snaps back to Bloom in the flaming room.
BLOOM (IN FLASHBACK)
So in the end, everyone gets
everything he wants.
BANG.
46   INT. DEUTCH MARK                                          46
BLOOM
That's what he does, he writes his
cons the way dead Russians write
novels, with thematic arcs and
imbedded symbolism and shit. And
he wrote me as a vulnerable anti-
hero. And that's why you think you
want to kiss me. It's a con.
He leaves Rose lying on the table and sweeps through the bar
towards the exit, passing Stephen.

Bloom stumbles up stone steps to street level.      A THOUSAND
YEAR OLD MAN sweeps up across the square.
Bloom sits wearily on the curb, bowler hat in hand, shirt
bright red with fake blood, face long as hell.
Putting the broom aside a moment, the old man walks painfully
across the street to Bloom. Standing nearly toe to toe with
him, the man pulls a huge joyful smile across his grizzled
face.
He then smears his hand over his mug, pulling the smile off
his face and rubbing it on Bloom's mouth. When he takes his
hand away, Bloom plays along and has the same big joyful
smile. The old man winks at him and walks back to his broom.
As soon as the old man is away, Bloom drops the smile.

The tiny stone porch outside a private apartment.   The red
car's bumper pulls up, parks.
On a small wood table, empty booze bottles and a loose pack
of cards. Fingertips spread the cards, then the fingertips'
owner heads for the apartment door.
51   INT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                                51
Stephen steps in cautiously, surveys the apartment.
A goddamn mess. Empty bottles and glasses, very little
light. Stephen opens the curtains, light streams in the
window. A groan of displeasure comes from the gloom.
Bloom stirs, passed out in a hammock. Unkept beard, a few
extra pounds. Crushed cigar hanging on his lip.
A rotund GRANDMOTHER waddles in, cleaning up bottles and
berating Bloom in a constant stream of angry Italian.
STEPHEN
She's right, you know.
BLOOM
Why are you here, Stephen?
STEPHEN
Put on your face, let's eat.

cheek and sends them off.

allergic to. The next day I came
in, the doctor lifted up my shirt,

to everything. So they sealed the

Wow.
PENELOPE
It wasn't `til I was nineteen they
discovered what I was actually
allergic to was the aluminum alloy
the hypodermic needle was made out
of. Then I was going to leave, but
my mom got sick. So I stayed. And
she stayed sick, a long time.
BLOOM
Do you feel cheated?
Penelope does an amazing card trick using the four queens.
PENELOPE
The trick to not feeling cheated is
to learn how to cheat. So I
decided this wasn't a story about a
miserable girl trapped in a house
that smelled like medical supplies
wasting her life on a dying person
she sometimes hated. It was about
a girl who could find infinite
beauty in anything, any little
thing. And do anything she decided
to do. And love the person she was
trapped with. So I told myself
that story until it became true.
Now did doing that let me escape a
wasted life, or did it just blind
me so I wouldn't want to escape it?
I don't know. But either way, I
was the one telling my own story.
So I don't feel cheated.
She finishes the trick.
A single pair of hands clapping turns their heads. At the
far end of the deck, alone at a table, the large man in the
fur collared cape, who for reasons unlikely to become clear
at the moment will be called THE CURATOR.
THE CURATOR

playing the part of a magician.   My
compliments.

Who is that man? You avoided him

clear of him.
A waltz drifts through the air from a band unseen.

I don't suppose in all your hobby

deepen. She shivers.

Bloom paces, Stephen shuffles cards.
BLOOM
I know you like to throw those
clever little details in, but
you've gotta watch that shit with
her Stephen. She had a lot of time
alone in that house, and she used
it. She did the best Double Dutch
Queens I've ever seen up on the
deck last night.
STEPHEN
Double Dutch Queens uses gaffed
cards.
BLOOM
She had them in her purse and cut
them in while I was folding my
napkin.
STEPHEN
Jesus.
BLOOM
That's what I'm saying. She's
different, she knows, sometimes it
feels like she knows everything.
Doesn't that worry you?
STEPHEN
No. But something about her is
worrying you plenty.

She feels like one of your
characters.

THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
And one day the boy was walking
home, and he quarrelled, he fought,
with a good friend of his. They
got very angry and his friend
pushed him a certain way and the
boy fell and struck his head and
died. The boy's friend was very
sad but also very frightened. So
instead of telling the boy's
parents, he did something awful.
He pulled the body into a quarry, a
pit of broken rocks, and hid the
boy beneath a pile of large stones.
Well. Years went by, and the boy's
friend became a young man, and one
day while drinking in town (which
in his guilt he did quite a lot of)
he heard that a well was being
built near the forest... with the
stones from the quarry. He ran to
the quarry to find it nearly
empty... no stones, no body. He
ran to the well where the masons
were finishing their work. `Did
they find anything strange in the
quarry?' he asked, expecting, maybe
hoping they'd arrest him for the
awful crime on the spot. But no,
they said, motioning to the well.
Nothing strange. Just stones.
They left him alone there at the
well, and he stood looking into it
as the sun fell behind the
mountains and twilight set the
world in a deep, still silence."|unknown
587||"The last image we land on is the well, alone in the clearing.
Its dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence
that follows.
Then, with a piercing ROAR, a living monster of stone lunges
out of the well, animated and terrifying, grabs the friend by
the throat and with a crunching of bones and one last roar
pulls him back down into the depths of the well.
Silence again. We pull out of the painting, back to the
Curator, sitting very still."|stage direction

The next morning we found her, in a
stone well on a neighboring
property. I climbed down to her,
but slipped and broke my leg, and
while we waited for the rescue team
to pull us out she died in my arms.
If you've had a child... my whole
everything just focused down to one
thing, to hold her and make her
feel safe. But no matter what I
said to her, I couldn't stop her
shaking, crying. Her last moments

feet ahead of him towards the stage.
Bloom gingerly follows it, up onto the splintered stage and
finally resting on a split in the tarpaulin backdrop.
With a wary glance back, Bloom steps through it."|stage direction

Just before they fall behind the safety of the flat, a red
burst of blood flowers from Stephen's left lower back.
Bloom sets him down gently, and hears heavy footsteps behind
him.
He turns, firing, but only sees a blur of dark coat go by,

Bloom runs out on stage, tearing the tarpaulin, and fires
after the dark figure limping up the aisle and away into the

Silence.

breathing heavy. Blood soaking through his shirt."|stage direction

Good. Here's what. Take Penelope
