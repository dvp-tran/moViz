Title card: In the glory days of the Elizabethan theatre
two playhouses were fighting it out for writers and
audiences. North of the city was the Curtain Theatre,
home to England's most famous actor, Richard Burbage.
Across the river was the competition, built by Philip
Henslowe, a business with a cash flow problem...
...The Rose...
Gradually a building is revealed, The Rose Theatre, three-
tiered, open to the elements and empty. On the floor,
roughly printed, a poster--torn, soiled, out of date. It
says:

cluttered shelf containing various objects, wedged
between crumpled pieces of paper. Among those we have
time to observe: a skull, a mug that says A PRESENT FROM
STRATFORD-UPON-AVON.
At infrequent intervals further pieces of crumpled paper
are tossed towards the shelf. The man who is throwing
them, WILL SHAKESPEARE, is bent over a table, writing
studiously with a quill.
Now we see what he is writing: Will is practising his
signature, over and over again. ""Will Shagsbeard…W
Shakspur…William Shasper…"" Each time he is dissatisfied,
and each time he crumples, and tosses it away.
Suddenly WILL becomes impatient. He jumps up and goes to
the loft area in the rafters, where he sleeps, and starts
to pull on his boots. At this point the door opens and
HENSLOWE walks in. He is out of breath and his feet hurt."|stage direction
