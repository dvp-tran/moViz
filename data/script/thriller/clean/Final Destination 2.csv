A padded wall is papered with NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS that date back to
the early 1900s:
""LOCAL FOWLER BROTHERS LOSE $35 TICKETS TO BOARD TITANIC"" appears
over ""FOWLER BROTHERS KILLED IN COAL MINE MISHAP."" Another series of
articles reads, ""JEWISH PROFESSOR DENIED ADMITTANCE TO HINDENBURG""
and ""PROFESSOR RABINOWITZ KILLED IN AVALANCHE."" Etc...
Continuing along the wall, the newspaper articles all focus on the
fates of the original SURVIVORS of the FLIGHT 180 CRASH.
We DISSOLVE between the various headlines depicting the gruesome
deaths of Tod, Terry, Ms. Lewton, Billy Hitchcock, Carter and Alex
Browning.
Also in the mix are various CRIME SCENE PHOTOS of the deaths.
Decapitated torsos, crushed, mangled bodies, the charred remains of
another and the face- down body of Alex Browning.
MAPS line the walls as well, pinpointing the locations of numerous
deaths, perhaps seeking a pattern. Charts that timeline bizarre
deaths, seating charts of downed aircraft, etc...
LATEX -GLOVED HANDS tear out the last article, apply fun- tack to its
corners and place it in the center of all the others:
A REMEMBRANCE FOR THE VICTIMS OF FLIGHT 180
Friday marks one year anniversary.

bugs) around his visor and drops back.
INSIDE NISSAN SUV
Kimberly falls back into the right lane and looks uneasy as she sees
a TRUCK DRIVER guzzling from a flask as it passes the SUV, revealing
its side is an ad for FIRESTONE TIRES.
It finally clears frame, revealing a highway billboard that reads,
""DRUNK DRIVING KILLS.""
Kimberly reaches back and pulls on her seatbelt in spite of laughter
from the back seat.
Up ahead, the RUSTY CHAIN seems to have more give to it. LOGS STRAIN
against it.
Suddenly, a black cloud of exhaust from a blue '83 Chevette in front
of them causes everyone to roll up their windows.

Rory, eyes like saucers, sits rigidly transfixed at the wheel and
nonchalantly wipes the CD clean on his pants.
INSIDE NISSAN SUV
She has dropped back behind the Chevette and CHP car and is running
down along side of a BLACK TRANS AM.
Up ahead she sees the Hig hway Patrol Car flick on its LIGHTS and pull
into the shoulder around the Chevette and behind the Semi loaded with

INSIDE POLICE CRUISER
Thomas bends to wipe up the mess. He only glances at the road as he
tries to soak up the coffee.
Suddenly up ahead, THE RUSTY CHAIN SNAPS! The logs roll off the side
of the truck onto the highway.
One bounces as it hits, and slams through Thomas' front winshield and
out the back, taking Thomas' head with it.
EUGENE slams on his brakes. His Harley slides out and he is SLAMMED
to the ground, sliding at 60 miles per hour across the highway, right
in front of the yellow mini-bus.
The MINI- BUS DRIVER brakes to avoid Eugene. The FOOTBALL PLAYERS
tumble forward and hit him in the head. He loses control and slides
off the road onto the grass median.
He blows a front tire and the mini-bus begins to flip, ROLLING
several times int o the oncoming lanes of traffic, and is HIT by a
MACK TRUCK.
Eugene slides into a huge log, and hits it with a sickening crunch.
Only to be HIT and CRUSHED by his sliding motorcycle.
Rory looks up too late and REAR ENDS Thomas' car, EXPLODING the gas
tank and HURLING Rory's dead body halfway through the windshield
where it remains half in/half onto the hood.
KAT, dialing, looks up, slams on her brakes, but SKIDS on oil from
the Chevette.
She swerves into Kimberly, SIDE SWIPES her, then swerves to miss a
huge log -- only to run head on into two more, flipping the
Expedition end over end right next to Kimberly.
Kimberly swerves back from being hit by Kat, just in time to see a
huge log ahead. She tries to turn hard to the right to avoid it, but
hits it broadside --
Sending the SUV FLIPPING OVER the top of the log and SLIDING down the
road. Inside, Shaina, Dano and Frankie are tossed around like rag
dolls, shredded by glass and shrapnel -- Frankie is EJECTED out the
side window.
Kimberly's SUV slides to a stop on its side. She looks back to her
mangled but still alive friends and up in time to see
NORA'S PACER
Nora sees the collisions ahead and slams on the brakes but the fallen
Naya bottle prevents her from braking, and she SLAMS into the back of
Kat's Expedition.
The crash test dummy collision folds her Pacer and it EXPLODES into a
huge fireball.
EVAN, blinded by the smeared windshield, is too late. He swerves his
Trans Am around the burning cars onto the wet grass.
Kimberly sees the topless Trans Am slowly roll out of a huge WALL OF
FIRE and coast to a stop. Evan comes up battered and bloody but still
alive. He is trapped in his burning car, screaming and trying to
release the seatbelt.
Then, just when she thought it was over, a HUGE SEMI slides thro ugh
the wall of fire, SMASHING the Trans Am out of the way, SPINNING it
like a top. With the back sliding at 90 degrees it keeps on coming.
KIMBERLY'S POV
The semi's grill comes right at her!

who cares; he's on a natural high. He peels his shirt off, revealing
his PIERCED NIPPLES, flicks on the radio and DANCES his way over to
the fridge and grabs a drink.
In the tiny kitchenette area, a small swarm of flies hovers over a
grease-filled frying pan.
Evan recoils, throws open the window and throws the grease to the
sidewalk five stories below. An ominous BREEZE enters --
And a kitchen cabinet slowly BLOWS OPEN. Some FORKS and KNIVES slide
forward on poorly stacked plates. Daring to fall into the toaster.
Evan spills some cooking oil on the range while pouring it into the
frying pan, then dumps in some frozen mozzarella sticks. Evan puts
the frying pan on the stove and turns it on HIGH.
He then grabs a container of CHINESE FOOD and rests it on the counter
next to the fridge. On the fridge, several colorful MAGNETS spell out
HEY E.
PUSH IN on the H - which mysteriously drops into the Chinese food -
the word EY E remaining. Oblivious, Evan puts the food in the

Lazily sliding off the shelf and into the toaster, protruding about
an inch and a half. Hardly noticeable.
By now, Evan has opened the next package; a gaudy gold and diamond
encrusted horseshoe ring.

Another small EXPLOSION from the microwave, this one cracking the
GLASS. A Solo Plastic Cup nearby begins to melt.
Flames sputter around the rim of the frying pan. In moments, the oil
from the pan IGNITES. A small fire.
Evan sees all this and YANKS with all his might. No use. As the FIRE
slowly spreads to nearby cereal boxes, Evan starts to panic. He
continues yanking... Stuck.
He sees a bottle of PALMOLIVE on the other end of the counter. His
fingers reach for it.
Slightly out of his grasp. But his fingertips are just long enough to
knock the bottle backwards - where it rests against TWO SWITCHES.
The FIRE ALARM goes off. The PHONE RINGS.
Evan desperately lifts his leg and tries to use his foot to edge the
Palmolive over. By pushing the bottle up against the wall, it
threatens to turn on one of the switches.

escape.
He dr ops the fire extinguisher, starts to climb out the window, hears
a creak and looks up just as --
A large jagged shard of glass comes CRASHING down at him -- Evan
jumps back just in time as it shatters before him. The fire
completely engulfs the kitchen.
He bravely jumps through the window pane, landing on the fire escape.
He runs down the fire escape from floor to floor.
A LARGE BLAST from his window showers him with glass and brick
shrapnel, but ultimately, he makes it to the fire escape's lowest
level, intact.
He tries to lower the rusty metal ladder to the ground. It budges
once, then twice, but won't go down. So he climbs over the railing
and gently drops to the ground.
Safe and sound, he breathes a sigh of relief and turns to walk --
SUDDENLY he s lips on the very grease he threw out the window, his
legs shoot out from under him and he lands on his back.
The rusty ladder suddenly dislodges and hurls downward -- coming
right for Evan's face -- but stops halfway!
