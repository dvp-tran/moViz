an original screenplay by
J.D. Zeik
DRAFT: May 20, 1997"|unknown
1||"A BLOOD RED SCREEN - A JAPANESE DRUM starts to play, softly,
but tinged with a desperate edge, growing louder, joined by
other DRUMS as a BLACK LEGEND scrolls up: In feudal Japan,
the warrior class of Samurai were sworn to protect their
liege lords with their lives.  Those Samurai whose liege was
killed suffered a great shame, and they were forced to wander
the land, looking for work as hired swords or bandits.  These
masterless warriors were no longer referred to as Samurai,
they were known by another name: Such men were called Ronin.
The words hang on the screen and we hold for a BEAT, and then
the DRUMS are cut off by - A SILENCED GUN SHOT: Thwpfft...

MOVING UP STONE SPIRALING STAIRS, up up up in what we now see
is a medieval cathedral.  And as we continue MOVING UP
something TRICKLES DOWN INTO FRAME - BLOOD.  Running thin,
then thicker, as we CONTINUE TO MOVE UP the stairs and find -
A BODY, sprawled awkwardly across the stones, arms and legs
akimbo, not so much Christ-like as victim-like.  In one hand
the Body holds a GUN he never had a chance to use.  In the
other - A DARK SHAPE, we can't quite tell what it is.
FOOTSTEPS sound from above and - THE KILLER walks into frame,
silenced pistol dangling at his side.  We don't know him, and
it's going to be a while before we see him again, but mark
his face because we'll see him again.  The Killer now picks
up the dark shape in the Body's hand, and we see it's - A
BRIEFCASE.  The Killer cuffs the Briefcase to his wrist and
turns to - TWO MEN standing behind him: subordinates.  The
Killer shows them the Briefcase."|stage direction

an obvious attitude, all of it bad.  But there's something

a seasoned tough guy who knows how to get rough and tumble.
He's big, and yeah he's got a gut, but the rest of him looks
solid."|stage direction

customers themselves, pretend not to watch too closely, but
they're interested: what's Larry going to say?  For a moment
it seems as if he's pissed, but then suddenly a smile breaks
out on his face and he laughs heartily at Vincent's remark.
Vincent joins in, as do the others.  In particular - THE
BARTENDER looks relieved -- he's tough enough to toss a bar
drunk, but these guys are in a different league.  The

phone: striking, dark-haired, Irish.  She carries herself
with the same professional edge as the men inside the bar.
Deirdre listens for a moment to the voice on the other end,
and before she speaks she sense something - A SILHOUETTE
stands in the shadows of the bar, watching Deirdre.  She
gives this silhouette a measure glance before speaking, her
hand creeping ever so slightly towards her coat."|stage direction
39|DEIRDRE|Can I help you?|speech

at the bar, talking casually, recognizing they're somehow all
here for a reason.  With Larry and Vincent we see - GREGOR, a
man from Eastern Europe.  His accent is hard to pin down,
but he most definitely has one.  Gregor has the air of an ex-
spook, and that's exactly what he is.  Lastly we see SWEDE --
blonde, muscular, and somehow blank in the face.  No, he's
not stupid -- he's a sociopath.  Now - Sam looks at the
group, which grows quiet as he enters.  Finally, Sam speaks."|stage direction

the cradle.  Deirdre stands at the phone booth, lost in
thought.  Then, without warning - Deirdre spins around,
pulling TWO GUNS from inside her coat.  The move is fast,
performed with the grace of a professional killer, as Deridre
scans the horizon, but nobody seems to be watching.  Deirdre
pockets her guns and steps into the shadows of the street,
the better to watch -
THE BAR - And as Deirdre watches the bar we watch her.

WATCHER.  Somebody we're going to see periodically through
the movie.  Right now he's only a SILHOUETTE with a well-
defined PAIR OF HANDS.  And in those hands - A KNIFE.  As the
Watcher watches he slowly cleans his nail with the knife,
methodically, perfectly.  And he watches.  First Deirdre, and
then turning his attention to THE BAR.  He's especially
interested in the bar.

Vincent exchange a look, and then the Bartender takes out a

into Vincent's hand.  The Bartender and Vincent speak in
rapid-fire French, and then the Bartender is gone.  Sam turns

And he most definitely didn't know who
was doing the hiring, only that they
were paying a lot of money..."|speech

grunt of acknowledgement, indicating that all of these men
were hired the same way."|stage direction

78|SAM|"So none of us knows who's paying the
freight, this is just some anonymous job.
For all we know, we're working for
different people."|speech
79|GREGOR|Now that is an interesting proposition.|speech
80|SWEDE|How so?|speech
81|GREGOR|"Because if there's more than one party
involved, if we really are working for
different people, then perhaps some of us
are on different sides."|speech

Vincent.  The two men nod at one another, acknowledging a
kind of mutual respect."|stage direction

for different people.  There's a chance
for one of us..."|speech

paid to cross the others.  I don't know

there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and
I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my
meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the
rest of you, and that's all any of us
needs to know about the other."|speech

open theirs and stare at the wads of Franc Notes stuffed

money.  But neither Vincent nor Sam takes a look."|stage direction

THE LIGHTS out of several other human targets, hitting each
target in a different place.  One he clips between the eyes,
the next in the heart, one in the groin, and then the last
target - He SPLITS DOWN THE MIDDLE, firing shot after shot
from the head to the groin until the target is sheared in
half.  Larry is impressed in spite of himself."|stage direction

cheaper phones by far than that one, man:
you better fucking use it."|speech

167|GREGOR|"I intend to.  This phone is wired like no
other: it's got an encryption chip and
instant sat-a-link recognition, it can
talk to any computer in any language and
make it understand.  With my custom
hardware and this phone I can trace the
target's cell phone signature and follow
him anywhere he goes..."|speech

bead on Vincent when - Sam hits Francois with a fusillade of
bullets in the chest and now - A SINGLE SPENT BULLED CASING
flies through the air in SLOW MOTION and lands on the ground,
spinning around until it comes to a halt and - A HEAVY
SILENCE FALLS, as the last echo of the last gunshot finally
dies.  Vincent and Sam look at one another, see that they're

building with the action as we do -
THE CHASE MONTAGE: A SERIES OF CUTS AS -
The Volvo takes a flying left turn -
Gregor watches the Target on his computer as it moves towards
the Promenade des Anglais, typing the results on his
keyboard as - The Volvo careens down a steep hill, hits a
bump, and flies through the air a good fifteen feet, even as -
The Fiat follows close behind and hits the same bump, does
the same flight through the air and lands with a thud -
THE CARAVAN of cars -
THE TARGET CAR -
THE TARGET, still talking away on his cell phone - THE
COMPUTER MAP tracking the Target's movements, as the Map
shifts and moves as it keeps pace with the target, and now -
The Promenade des Anglais is right ahead and the DRUMS build
to a crescendo as -
The Volvo SMASHES into the Target Car and they grind
together, as -
CARS 3 & 4 in the Caravan are cut off by Vincent's Fiat,
which forces them to slam to a halt, as -
Larry runs the Target Car to a halt and the JAPANESE DRUMS
stop.
Larry and Swede hop out of the Volvo, and Swede brandishes a
MONSTER of a MACHINE GUN, with which he opens fire, a blast
of huge guage shells spitting a trail of fire, smashing
against THE WINDSHIELD of the Target Car, which is bullet-
proof.  The windshield doesn't break right away -- but the
heavy blast of firepower causes the windsield to buckle.
Sam and Vincent are now out of the Fiat, guns drawn, blazing
away at BODYGUARDS, and Christ, there's an army of them,
pouring out of Cars 3 & 4.  These guys are armed and returning
fire as -
Larry gets out of the driver's seat of the Volvo, and he's
got some kind of sumbitch weapons himself, a ROCKET LAUNCHER,
which he points and fires - And now we TRACK THE MISSLE as
it scorches the air, traveling towards -
The LEAD CAR of the caravan which has only now realized
what's going on behind it, and as frantic Bodyguards drive
back towards the carnage - The Missle IMPACTS, blowing the
Car sideways.
Meanwhile - Sam and Vincent are taking out the Other
Bodyguards, and these guys are warriors -- they moves as a
team, each man with a gun in both hands, using a weapon until
it's out of bullets and then discarding it in favor of a new
one.
And even as this is going on - Deirdre has joined the fray,
firing both of her pistols, taking Sam's place at Vincent's
side so that Sam can run towards -
The Target Car, where the Target is seated in the backseat,
pulling out his own piece, ready to fight to the death
himself as -
Swede continues blasting away at the windshield with his
monster gun, and now - The Windshield has started to crack
and splinter, and abruptly, it shatters, instantly bursting a
bright red as Swede's bullets tear up the body of the Driver.
Now Sam has reaches the Target Car, just as the Target, who
is armed and, as we know, not exactly helpless, steps out of
the car and sights in on Swede and - ZING!  Sam fires,
winging the Target, knocking the gun out of his hand and
still the Target won't give up without a struggle, he hits
Swede with the Briefcase."|stage direction

519||"BANG.  Swede puts one shot between the Target's eyes, ending
his life.  Now - Swede takes out a DAI-SHO, the smaller of the
two traditional Japanese Samurai swords.  With one slashing
blow he hacks off the Target's HAND AT THE WRIST and grabs
the briefcase.  The SEVERED HAND is still caught in the
handcuffs, so that it is carried along for the ride.  Now -
DISTANT SIRENS sound from OFF SCREEN as Swede moves back
towards Larry and the Volvo, and as he goes he raises the
briefcase (with its severed hand) in a kind of mock salute to
Sam, who starts to move back towards Deirdre and Vincent, who
have taken care of the remaining Bodyguards, and now the
SIRENS are growing closer as we - START TO MOVE IN SLOW
MOTION as Swede approaches the Volvo and - Deirdre and Vincent
are already at Vincent's Fiat, waiting for Sam, and so they
don't notice that - A VAN has been parked nearby this entire
time, and now the van's side door slides open, and unseen by
any of the others - Gregor steps out of the Van, a gun at his
side, and a predatory look on his face as - Swede reaches Larry
and the Volvo just as - Sam has reaches the Fiat, and now he looks
back and sees - Gregor, crossing the street, and now - Sam
screams a warning to Larry, but it's way too late because -
Swede shoots Larry in the neck, hitting him above the
protective covering of his bullet proof vest.  Now we're
MOVING IN REAL TIME as - Larry manages to get his backup
piece drawn, a snub-nosed .38, and he fires all six shots
into - Swede, hitting him in the stomach -- it's the same way
Larry shot the target in the warehouse.  Swede is sent flying
backwards, where he crashes to the pavement.  For a second we
think he's dead, but then he gets up, in pain but alive, just
as Sam predicted.  Swede claws at his shirt to reveal that he
too wears a bullet proof vest.  By now - Larry has rolled out
of the Volvo, crawling away but too weak to go far, and now -
Swede has Larry in his sights, he's going to kill him."|stage direction

firing straight up into Swede's brain.  Then, without even
looking at Larry, who is lying helpless on the ground -

it across the ground, beneath the Mercedes, which the cops

off the cops, and as this happens, Vincents puts the pedal to

what they're shooting at, but shooting all the same as Sam

A BACK ENTRANCE TO THE CHATEAU -
Some kind of kitchen storage area, and as Sam and Vincent
burst in from outside - FIVE RUSSIAN HOODS come flying in
from an interior entrance, and this is it, Sam and Vincent
are outnumbered, outgunned, they're going to die and then -
They take out the entire room - Sam holds an automatic pistol
in his left hand, and a submachine gun in his right, and when
he fires, he does so in short controlled bursts, firing only
when he has the target in his sights, while - Vincent fights
with a kind of sheer force, a shotgun in one hand, an Uzi in
the other, he fires at anything and everything that moves,
and he hits almost all of it - And suddenly the room is
quiet.  Everybody's dead except for Sam and Vincent.  They
drop their spent weapons and take out fresh ones even as they

leading to a separate wing of the chateau."|stage direction

Gunmen.  He kills the first, and then the second, and then -
No third.  The Third Gunman rolls out of the way as Sam
fires, the Third Gunman fires back and - Their shots go wide,
ripping into mirrors and chandeliers, littering the floor
with glass.  And now we're -

Running through the halls as we hear one last burst of
gunfire: somebody in the ballroom is dead.  Deirdre has
almost reached the ballroom when - Sam comes flying out, and
the two of them CRASH TOGETHER, sending the two of them
sprawling into - The shot-up mess that used to be the
Ballroom - And as they crash to the ground, Sam loses his
weapon in the fall, but Deirdre manages to hold onto one of
her two guns.  Now the two of them roll to their feet, and as
they do we're back in -
THE DINING ROOM -
Seamus the Madman is pacing the floor, his face even worse
than before: with each minute the mask of flesh that is now
his face is becoming more grotesque.  Little pustules have
started to form all over its surface, oozing a whitish
viscous liquid.  A NEW BURST OF FIGHTING SOUNDS can be heard,

function as a lever, sending the gun - THROUGH THE AIR in a
graceful SLOW-MO arc until it - THWACKS into Sam's Hand.  Now
he's armed and he looks back at - Deirdre.  Her FINGER

Briefcase.  Before Mikhi can even react, Gregor stabs his arm
forward in a savage arc - JAMMING THE BLADE into Mikhi's
throat.  Mikhi drops his gun and reaches for the blade,
already gagging on the blood spray which shoots from the
slashed artery.  Within seconds - Mikhi falls to the ground,
jerking viciously in his death throes as - Gregor picks up
the pistol and runs to leave the room, and as he does we move
to -
THE GALLERY -
Filled with Paintings and Sculptures, nothing less than 200
years old.  This place is a maze, what with it's walls of
paintings that jut out here and there, the various corridors
which lead from room to room, and the sculptures which block
sight lines.  Now we find - Vincent, pressed against a wall, a
gun in each hand, while - FIVE RUSSIAN MAFIA GUYS are hunting
him down.  We do a SERIES OF QUICK CUTS as the Five Guys split
up and look for Vincent, all the while speaking in low Russian
voices.  Suddenly one of the Guys turns a corner and sees -
Nothing.  No Vincent.  Now he turns back and - A FIST CRASHES
through a painting which hangs on a makeshift wall.  It's
Vincent.  His hand wraps around Mafia Guy's neck, pinning him
in place.  Seconds later - Two quick shots rip through the
painting, hitting Mafia Guy in the head.  Now - The other men
are alerted by the shots, they come running and - Vincent steps
out firing -
And now it's a bullet-fest, as he gets the drop on them,
using the maze of the Gallery to his fullest advantage,
gunning them down - First one - Then two - Three, and then -
No four.  Vincent turns, surprised that his man wasn't where
he expected him to be when - A SHOT RINGS OUT, hitting
Vincent, a flesh wound that disarms him.  The Last Guy has
the drop on Vincent.  Now - The Last Guy smiles a nasty
little smile at Vincent and - A PISTOL spits fire and - A
BULLET bursts out of the Last Guy's chest.  It's Sam.  Now
Sam and Vincent exchange a look: Sam has, once again, saved
Vincent's life."|stage direction
