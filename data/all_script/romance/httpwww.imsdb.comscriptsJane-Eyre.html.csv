2||EXT. A MIDSUMMER DAWN. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.|location
3||"First light. Jane Eyre is running across a meadow, flushed
and breathless; the hem of her plain, black dress soaked
with dew. She carries a shawl and has a small bag of
belongings over her shoulder.
She trips, falls to her knees; looks back. Expressive eyes,
open features. She is desperate. We see the house she is
running from; a Jacobean battlemented mansion.
Her need to escape is so great that she crawls forward
until she is able to raise herself to her feet. She runs.
She reaches an antique stile by a brook. She lifts herself
on to it. She lands on the road. And runs.
I/E. DAY. A ROADSIDE/COACH.
The sun is higher in the sky. Jane exhausted, now running
down a main road. Her spirts lift at the sight of an
approaching coach. She flags it down.
Jane empties her purse into the driver's hand. He looks at
her money then suspiciously back at her. A terse nod
indicates she can get in."|stage direction
4||"Jane sinks into a dark corner. Her fellow passengers look
shocked by her dishevelled appearance at such an early
hour. She undertakes a tremendous effort not to betray her
emotional state. She doesn't sob, she doesn't howl -
although her breathing threatens to. Slowly, unable to bear
the day, she closes her eyes."|stage direction
5||EXT. EVENING. WHITCROSS.|location
6||"Sunset. A whitewashed, stone pillar set up where four roads
meet on a barren moor. The coach driver opens the door.
With a curt nod he indicates that Jane must get out.
She looks around, dismayed. In each direction there is open
moorland for as far as the eye can see. The driver sets off
at a good pace - glad to be rid of such a passenger. Jane
puts her hand to her side for her bag of belongings. It is
not there.
She runs as fast as she can after the coach. It is receding
towards the horizon. She comes to a halt, objectless, lost,
alone. She pulls her knitted shawl around her.
She leaves the road and sets off across the moor, into the
gathering dark."|stage direction

sits up. She is alone."|stage direction
16||EXT. DAY. BY A RIVER.|location
17||"Jane is crouched on a rock watching the waters go by. The
sky is overcast. The first big drops of rain land on the
stones. Jane makes no movement.
A raven lands on a rock nearby. Jane is suddenly filled
with a wild rage. She picks up a stone and hurls it at the
bird with a raw cry. The gesture exhausts her. She watches
the bird wheel away, as the rain starts to pour."|stage direction

looks back at Jane. With her last strength, Jane follows."|stage direction
26||EXT. EVENING. THE MOOR.|location
27||"Dark clouds are banking up; the rain starts again. Jane is
struggling through a marsh. Her boots are stuck.
She falls. Her hand disappears into mud; her face pressed
against the earth. She doesn't move. She has reached the
point of despair.
The girl's bare feet walk close by, as if waiting for her.
Jane looks up. Where the child should be, she sees a light
shining across the moor. Jane starts crawling."|stage direction
28||EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR/MOOR HOUSE.|location
29||"Jane is toiling on through the lashing rain towards the
light. It has become a window. A brief flash of lightning
shows her a low stone cottage. Helen Burns is sitting on
the gate."|stage direction
30||"Jane is crawling through the narrow garden. On her knees,
she peers through a window.
On either side of a bright little fire sit two young women.
They look exactly like Jane; slight, neat, dressed in
black. One, Diana, has her hair slightly curled and hides
her gentle eyes behind spectacles. The other, Mary, is very
young; no more than seventeen. Each has a book on her knee.
They are talking intimately.
They look so close, so loving and the room looks so cosy
that it pains Jane considerably."|stage direction

There is a book lying on the seat. She opens it."|stage direction

That's for the look you had on
your face. You bad animal."|speech

young and plump, quickly wipes her bleeding forehead. She

If you are passionate and rude
like this, your Aunt Reed will
send you away."|speech

work for our keep; you do
nothing. Pray for forgiveness
Miss Eyre or something bad will
come down that chimney and fetch
you away."|speech

of the stool. The room is chill, silent. Red walls and
curtains, murky in the fading light.
In front of Jane, a stone fireplace gapes like a mouth.
Beside it, a full length looking-glass in which her pale
reflection stares out. Behind her, a bed supported on
pillars of mahogany, hung with red."|stage direction

112||"The piled up pillows and mattresses glare in cold white.
Jane's breathing is the only sound in the room.
A sudden gust sends rain pelting against the windows like
fingernails. A distant moan of wind seems to breathe out of
the black hearth. Jane reverts her nervous gaze to the
pitted mirror. Her eyes lock on the small figure trapped in
the mirror's visionary hollow; her white, bleeding face,
her eyes glittering with fear.
It is a phantom. The eyes are black, the skin a deathly
grey. Blood. Jane's breathing becomes choked with terror.
She can't get her breath. We hear blood rushing through her
ears. It sounds like the beating of great wings.
Slowly, a light appears over her. It may be something
shining in from outside. But to Jane it seems as if it is
surrounding her, enveloping her. The figure in the looking
glass opens its mouth. The scream, held in so long, finally
rips from Jane's throat."|stage direction

open before her. She has put on a tiara, a diamond
necklace, bracelets. She is gazing at a ruby brooch. She
turns to Rochester. His expression is calm, resigned.
Bertha begins to laugh.
She takes the candelabra from the table. She admires
herself in the mirror; her white shift, the black feathers,
the jewels. She holds up the candelabra and sets the huge
curtains alight.

1740||"Jane is walking through forest, along a grass grown track.
Her pace is fast; her journey almost at an end. She comes
to a pair of rusting iron gates hanging open between
granite pillars. She walks through them.
She finds herself in front of a decrepit Elizabethan manor
house; no garden, just a sweeping semi circle of meadow
grass, which someone has cut at with a scythe. Jane stops.
Standing on the threshold is Edward Fairfax Rochester. He
is in his shirtsleeves. He stands strong, stalwart,
brooding. His hair is still raven black. He is looking
sightlessly around his domain, with the concentration of a
hawk. His strength is undiminished.
He walks fifteen paces from the house. It brings him into
the middle of the semicircle of grass. He is close enough
for Jane to see his scarred eyes. She walks towards him,
silent.
A few drops of rain begin to fall. Rochester puts out his
right hand to feel them. He raises his face up to the sky
as if he is looking for something from there. He is
absolutely still; his expression, serene.
Jane is very close. She steps on a twig. It breaks with a
loud crack, shattering the silence. Rochester is
immediately on guard, his expression turning wary.
Jane Eyre adapted by Moira Buffini March 2008 118.
He suddenly swipes the air with his left arm; the ruin of
it passing an inch from her face. Jane steps back.
Rochester swipes again. She holds her breath.
He seems satisfied at last that nothing is there. He turns
and walks fifteen paces back to the house. He disappears
into the dark interior.
Jane starts to breathe again."|stage direction
