1||"FADE IN ON:
Dark clouds below the inky remnants of the scorched sky. We hear  wind
as we sail, like a glider, over the black atmosphere.
We DIVE DOWN into the murkiness, through the clouds, into the   darker
world of  the dead  surface of  Earth, the  desert of  the real.   The
rotted skeleton of a massive city is sprawled everywhere. We  approach
a fissure in the Earth's crust, and as we do, we hear the   increasing
buzz of multiple hovercraft  engines. Blue flashes grow  in  intensity
from the fissure. Radio voices,  indistinct at first, grow louder   as
we approach the fissure."|stage direction

5||"The azure glow  from the  fissure  is suddenly overwhelming.  A  tight
convoy  of  three  HOVERCRAFT  explode  from  the  fissure,  traveling
nearly straight up, like a   trio of massive locomotives flying   into
the sky in tight formation,  linked together by tow cables.  The  blue
glow has  been emanating  from  the  overworked flare  drives of   the
first and third hovercrafts.  Between them, suspended by  tow  cables,
is the dark, scorched,  and sliced NEBACHANEZZER. They  rocket upward,
slowing as they reach the top of the arc."|stage direction

Anderson, crowd the cockpit. Helpless, the landscape speeds away  from
them, while a wall of red-eyed SQUIDDIES speeds to them.
It's been a mere TWO DAYS  since the realization of NEO’S POWERS   and
the defeat of AGENT SMITH. The slipstream whistles violently into  the
interior  of the  ship, and  the crew  is cold,  tired, haggard,   and
stressed beyond  belief as  they can  only watch  the action in  their

NEO has been gripping an oh-shit handle on the edge of the cockpit. He
relaxes his grip as their escape is clear. Their ship suddenly  enters
a cave, and starts  to descend. The blue  wash of the ship  shows rock
walls and pipes. The ships are slowing down as they descend back  into

FADE INTO:
TRINITY'S  CABIN.  At  first  we  see  only  stars  twinkling, faraway
diamonds on a black velvet background. The camera descends through the
darkness, to a sunset, dark blue, as if just after sunset. The artwork
terminates in the metal ring going  around her room. It's a much  more
hospitable place than the rest of the dreary hovercraft. The  articles
she's collected during  her time in  the resistance dot  the cabin. An
unfinished sweatshirt sits on a loom. There are charcoal portraits  of
loved ones.
Softly lit, the cabin sways slightly. The NEB is still in tow. NEO  is
sitting against the wall on Trin's bed, with her curled up beside  him
with her head on his lap.
Neo can’t sleep. He stares at the wall opposite him. There's a   photo
of the crew of the NEB, sans Trin, in better days. Smiling,   laughing
as they are  seated around the  table. Morpeus, Tank,  Dozer,  Switch,
Epoch, Mouse. Neo stops on the image of a smiling CYPHER. There's   an
unknown Asian man in the photo, looking withdrawn and a bit lonely.
Gently,  placing  Trinity's head  down,  NEO stands  and  examines the
photo."|stage direction

houses in a cave so huge  the ceiling is out of site.  Crewpersons run
around,  servicing  battle-damaged   vehicles.  Munitions  are  carted
across the tarmac on   robot rolling racks. No  one  pays the NEB  and
its battered crew any mind.
Nearby, the SEPHORA and FREEDOM  are parked. Their engines shut  down,
and their powered hatches are open. The crewmembers are spilling out.
NIOBE hurries to MORPHEUS' side, and he steps toward her, smiling, but
their  military manner  is quickly  restored, though  they can  barely
contain their grins."|stage direction

SHE shakes his hand, the shake slows down.

THEY close for a kiss, when the FREEDOM'S captain suddenly jumps
between them.
It's CHOI - the NEO's supposed neighbor and hacking financier.

Carved into the street level  are innumerable stores and shops,  above
them,  apartments and  balconies that  rise to  the top  of the  arch.
People  flow  through the  street.  Their clothes  are  homespun wool,
denim, and leather. Dyes and  color are absent. Carved into  the solid
granite  walls,  between  homes  and  around  windows  and  doors, are
intricate and beautiful carvings.
NEO is lead down  the street by CHOI,  DUJOUR, and TRINITY, and  a few
other rebels. The push through a mult-culti crowd of people,  humanity

THREE ABRAMS stop in the  street. Their turrets swing into  place with

AT ONCE,  they open  fire with  their main  cannons and machines guns.
FIRE FLOWERS blaze from the death machines, sending a typhoon of  lead
down the street.  Troops filed between  the tanks pull  their triggers
and don’t let go. Everything in the street is shredded and blown away,
as though it was hit by a high-power pressure hose.
WITH UNEARTHLY  SPEED, EVERYONE  BREAKS for  the sides  of the street,
except for CHOI. He stands amid  it all as the tracers come  closer to
his body. He raises his machine  gun with his good arm, and  lays into
the enemy.
TRACER rounds kick away from  his gun, ripping straight back  into the
wall  of soldiers.  His rounds  deflect off  the sloped  armor of  the
tanks, recoils pile into the flesh  of troops. He rakes his fire  into
the enemy bodies.

TRACERS zoom in on  him. A tank round  blasts by, and the  wall of air
kicks him to his side. He continues to fire even as a bullet, followed

STRAIGHT UP THE FAÇADE OF THE BUILDING, as TRINITY jumps from cover to
cover, cart wheeling through tracer fire and bullets.
ON  THE  OTHER side  of  the street,  MORPHEUS  goes straight  up  the
building  façade  and  starts  running  sideways,  completely  defying
gravity, firing downward at the soldiers.
CU: CHOI
HE WILL NOT FALL, and a hose of lead drills into him, taking his  body
apart piece by piece. Bullets take away pieces of his head, neck,  and
torso, and in one final wave of fire, he is disintegrated, leaving his
machine gun, barrel  smoking, spinning in  the air, firing  still. The
arm is still attached and finger  clenching on the trigger. It is  the
last piece of CHOI to fall.
MORPHEUS climbs  as he  runs. In  mid-stride he  changes magazines and
stops, standing on the wall, his body parallel to the ground.
On the other side of the street, NIOBE stands on the wall, blazing  at
the mass of troops with two  guns that never cease. THERE is  no cover
and  no reprieve  from the  DOUBLE DEATH  from above.  Most are  still
firing down the street, or over toward TRINITY.
TRINITY runs  up the  side of  the street.  Her guns  go empty and she
dives behind a stoop as a squad of soldiers blazes away at her.

In slow motion, he  pulls a spoon from  a grenade. Somehow, the  metal
ring reaches TRINITY’S ears.

She slaps a magazine into her  pistol, pulls the action and comes  out
from under cover just enough to see the soldier releasing the grenade.
She fires, hitting the grenade. IT explodes directly over the group of
soldiers, flattening them to the ground.
A  BULLET smacks  through TRINITY’S  wrist, and  the hand  comes off,
popping like the head off  a dandelion. Blood spurts from  the severed
arteries, spraying the hand, with the pistol still in its grip.
ABOVE THE STREET, MORPHEU AND  NIOBE leap for one another.  They catch
each other’s arms, fifty feet  above the surviving enemy, and  spin in

with their  machine guns,  but the  rounds miss  the spinning  couple.

too  slow to  cut the  agent’s head  off. Instead,  it slices  cleanly
through the triceps of the raised arms, leaving nick on the throat.
RAZOR, dressed in a black kimono and wielding two katanas, steps  over
Morpheus as  he pursues  the agent.  Smith rolls  backwards, gains his
footing, and retreats from the  swirling blades of death. He  turns to

sword.
SMITH’s back is against the sunset. The sun drops below a cloud.
RAZOR flashes  the light  off his  short blade,  directly into Smith’s
eyes, blinding him as he strikes with the long sword.
SMITH, blinded, turns and backs away. RAZOR attacks.

clean, and immaculately dressed. He replaces his sunglasses and  kicks
through  the remains  of the  booth, walking  toward the  fight as  he
produces new weapons, heavy with ammo, from his long coat.
RAZOR keeps  swinging at  SMITH -  and missing.  Seeing his chance, he
runs back for the ringing  phone. SMITH pursues, almost on  RAZOR when
the neo-samurai jumps in the  air and pirouhettes, swinging one  sword
after another, like a helicopter blade from Hell.
IN the liquid  world of slo-mo,  the short sword  cuts through Smith’s
outstretched fingers, sending them  flying. The long sword  grazes his
forearm, cutting through the fabric  and taking off a slice  of flesh.
The tip of  the sword slices  through his suit,  cutting his tie  off,
digging about an inch into his torso.
SMITH collapses into the dust, his  face a mask of blood and  dust. He
doesn’t try to get up.
RAZOR passes MORPHEUS, who backs up to the ringing phone booth.  Razor
goes  through first.  MORPHEUS keeps  his eyes  and weapon  locked on
SMITH, who  makes no  attempt to  pursue. He  stands calmly,  and in a
dignified manner, wipes dust off  his clothing as he watches  Morpheus
step into the booth, and replace the phone.
It rings. One hand on the receiver, Morpheus stares back at Smith.
SMITH stands there, not attempting to pursue. Morpheus pauses,  taking
advantage of the chance to observe his deadly enemy.
SMITH stares at the booth for a second. Emotion twists his face, first
anger,  then  perhaps  sadness.  He’s lost.  He’ll  be  in  the Matrix
forever.
With a quicksilver flash,  his body reverts back  to the shape of  the
rookie cop.
THE young  man is  left standing  there. He  is filthy,  bloody, badly
sliced up, and the fingers of one hand are missing. He looks around at
the carnage  as his  mouth simply  opens and  closes, reflexively,  in
shock. He focuses on Morpheus.
The rebel answers the phone and disappears, leaving the cop, his  body
broken and his mind blown."|stage direction
