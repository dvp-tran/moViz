Jenny orders Marley to sit; instead Marley jumps up on her
and puts his paws on her shoulders. She presses his butt to
the ground, and he rolls over for a belly rub. She tries to
tug him into place and he grabs the leash in his teeth,
shaking it playfully.
MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)
That, class, is an example of a dog
that has been foolishly allowed to
believe he is the alpha male of his
pack. And therefore he cannot be a
happy animal."|speech

loosens as soon as he stops pulling."|speech

step off with your left foot - I don't
want to see any right foot first
steppers - and walk. If your dog gets
ahead, administer a correction by
forcefully bring your left hand down
and towards the right, and he'll
respond. Shall we? One, two, three -

Just as the dogs and owners prepare to step off, Marley
lurches ahead of the pack..."|speech

Marley explodes forward."|speech

one's own authority. Shall I
demonstrate a simple walk?"|speech
405|JOHN|"Be my guest.
MS. KORNBLUT
Class? Even an unruly dog wants to
obey his leader. Marley? Heel.

confident than she is. He lunges, she pulls, he falls back
on his hind legs, then barrels up and lurches forward.
Ms. Kornblut half-stumbles, half rockets across the park.
She manages to turn Marley around, and the whole process
begins again as they make their way back to the line. Her
face is flushed with embarrassment, anger, and exertion, but
Marley, jowls frothing, is having a ball. It's like a
walking tug-of-war.
With difficulty, Ms. Kornblut manages to return Marley to
John, but not before, as a coup-de-grace, he starts humping
her leg enthusiastically. She struggles, he knocks her down,

Jenny sits on the couch. Marley stands at her feet, with his
shoulders between her knees, his big head resting in her lap.
His tail hangs flat between his legs. His eyes are turned up
at her, and he whimpers softly.
Jenny strokes his head a few times and then, with no warning,
buries her face in the thick fur of his neck and begins
sobbing. They stay like that for a moment, Marley statue-
still, Jenny clutching him to her like an oversized doll.
John stands there, watching Marley take care of her. No
words, just being there. A lesson here. Her head down,
