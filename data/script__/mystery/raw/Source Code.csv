4|SOURCE CODE|"COLTER jolts awake. Sunlight hits his face.
He blinks. A stunned beat. He's disoriented.
Slowly he turns his head to one side...
PASSENGERS. Filling most of the seats. Office workers on
their morning commute into a city.
Turning the other way, he's confronted with a window. Trees
flash by, splitting the rising sunlight into a hypnotic
strobe pattern.
Colter looks to be thirty years old. A military buzz cut. A
disciplined physique, lean and spare, almost gaunt. Skin
burnished by years of desert sandstorms and equatorial sun.
His expression, prematurely aged by combat, is perpetually
wary, sometimes predatory, accustomed to trouble.
Despite his military bearing, Colter wears a button down
shirt and navy sports coat. On his wrist is a digital watch.
It reads 7:40 a.m.
He swallows. A strange, creeping panic.
He has no idea where he is."|speech

NEW ANGLE -- Skimming alongside as the train twists and

BAG. Is that his?
Tentatively, he lifts the edge of the bag to look inside. A
red APPLE rolls against two LIBRARY BOOKS. The bag's leather
NAME TAG reads: ""SEAN FENTRESS.""ù
It's not coming back to him. This whole experience is
starting to freak him out.
He catches the scent of something. A passenger walks by with
a STEAMING CUP OF COFFEE.
CHK-THOCK! Two rows back, an OVERWEIGHT MAN opens a can of
soda.
Sitting opposite Colter, facing him, is a WOMAN in her late
twenties (CHRISTINA). In contrast to the corporate suits
around her, her appearance is thrift store funky: black nail
polish, dark lipstick, black hair with blue streaks, a button-
down blouse edged in black funeral lace with silver skull-and-
bones cufflinks. She's busy writing in a journal."|speech

cramped office with chairs and surveillance monitors."|speech
23|CONDUCTOR|"Ticket?
A heavy-set CONDUCTOR stands in the aisle. A jangling of
keys. Colter just stares at him. Dazed."|speech

The last thing on his mind. Bewildered, he searches his
pockets."|speech

He pulls out a citation pad."|speech

waking up or buying a ticket or
getting on the train or anything

A forty-something SECRETARY does a crossword puzzle.
DEREK, a stock broker type, talks on his cell phone:"|speech
40|DEREK|"Trust me, by one o'clock, the

guidebook.
A dowdy OFFICER MANAGER type sorts supermarket coupons into a
tabbed file box.
An African American EXECUTIVE reads a newspaper.
None of them pays any attention to Colter.
A WHOOSH of AIR -- he turns to
An AIR-CONDITIONING VENT. The HISS of AIR sound sinister.
Like the exhalations of a creature.
A SCRAPE. He looks to see
A woman FILING HER NAILS.
Colter cringes. Every detail, every sensory impression seems
heightened, near the point of overload.
He reaches Christina again. Eases back in the seat across
from her. She writes in her journal, ignoring him.
6.
There's something else in his sports coat. A WALLET. He
turns it over a few times, inspecting it. Pulls out a
DRIVER'S LICENSE. Another man's face is in the photo. The
name on the license reads: ""SEAN FENTRESS.""ù The same name as
on the messenger bag. The street address on the license
reads: ""58 Alexander Road, Princeton Junction, New Jersey.""ù"|speech

that?
And why does he have this guy's wallet? He leans forward to
speak with Christina again."|speech

writing but DRAWING. A well-executed sketch of a face."|speech

How old do you think I am, anyway?"|speech

I don't know how I got here."|speech

So did I. Unfortunately, I
remember the whole thing."|speech

The train begins to SLOW DOWN. A few people begin to get up.
The platform of Newark Station slides into view."|speech

wallet here...
He holds up the driver's license. One final attempt to
convince her."|speech

54|CHRISTINA|Of course it is.|speech
55|COLTER|What?|speech
56|CHRISTINA|"Take a look in the mirror, good

The mirror? She goes back to her sketchbook. Determined not
to be interrupted again. Anxiety ripples through Colter."|speech
57|COLTER|"This can't be happening.
The train lurches to a stop.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
Newark Station.
Colter gets up. Through the windows, a few passengers
disembark onto the platform: Derek, the Old Man, the College
Kid and GUZMAN, a Middle Eastern man, who HURRIES past all of
them towards the station building.
8.
Colter only half notices all this. He's intent on reaching
the train's BATHROOM, the door of which is now OPEN.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
All aboard. Doors are closing.
Christina watches Colter go. Curious.

blinks."|speech

On tip-toes, he looks into crawl space and discovers

It's an enormous device. Several large CANNISTERS tied
together, full of sloshing liquid. Barely discernible behind
wires and gaffing tape is CELL PHONE -- the bomb's detonator."|speech

steaming coffee, the cramped proximity of other passengers,
the crinkle of an freshly-ironed dress shirt, the glint of a
buckle on a purse, the slanting sunlight, the trees out the
window, bursting with summer leaves.
Almost unintentionally, Colter finds himself repeating the
same opening actions as last time -- checking his watch (7:40
a.m.)... turning at the scent of passing coffee... peeking in
the canvas messenger bag beside him...
This time, however, he takes the books out of the messenger
bag. The books are stamped ""NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY.""ù

Sudden dizziness. He grabs a seatback for support. Sensory

takes a seat.

Colter starts down the long aisle.
In his seat, Guzman slips on dark glasses. He looks
forbidding with his mustache and olive-colored skin."|speech

Colter stands in front of him, arms crossed. Behind his dark

An edgy silence. Other passengers looking over. Colter's

Colter's footsteps echo down the length of the deserted men's

What's there? What's on that base?
B-52s. KC tankers. Air Combat
Command. Predator Drones. Remote
operations.
(something to this)
This a remote operation."|speech
353|(FINALLY)|"What if it is time travel?
42.
A worried CONDUCTOR runs past them, talking rapidly into his
radio. We catch the words ""bomb threat.""ù"|speech
354|COLTER|"What did he say?
A WARNING ALARM begins beeping. Passengers look around
uneasily. Christina, however, focuses her anger on Colter."|speech
355|CHRISTINA|"Do me a favor. Don't ever talk to
me again.
She drops his messenger bag at his feet and walks away.
Colter looks down at his watch. THE LAST SECONDS TICK AWAY --
5... 4... 3..."|speech
356|COLTER|"Christina!
He grabs her -- she struggles against him --"|speech
357|CHRISTINA|"Get off me!
But he HOLDS HER TIGHT, shielding her with his body and
squeezing his eyes shut as --
THE EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE TRAIN -- EVERYTHING VAPORIZES.
Blinding light. Painful to look at.
Like a star exploding.
A dull, hollow sound of WIND rattling through an abyss.
And then the ghostly still life. Details flicker into view:
A bicycle. A stone wall. And next to it...
A woman.
It's Christina. Turning to look at us. A gentle, reassuring
smile."|speech
358||INT. ISOLATION UNIT|location
359|CHRISTINA|"Click -- click. Click -- click. The video monitor is
malfunctioning. It flickers on and off, revealing Colter's
face in and out of darkness.
43.
The capsule is nearly shut down. The controls appear non-
functional. Ice crystals have formed over the circuitry.
Colter hugs himself, shivering. His breath is visible in the
capsule's tomb-like cold."|speech
360|COLTER|"Goodwin? What's happening? Come
in. Can you read me? It's goddamn
cold in here.
He hits a few buttons. Almost at random. The VENTS which
had been blowing in air FALL SILENT."|speech
361|COLTER|"Goodwin, I'm losing oxygen.
The monitor fizzles out. The light from the controls FADES."|speech
362|COLTER|"Goodwin!
It's now COMPLETELY DARK.
He BANGS on the side of the capsule. Just a muffled thump.
A terrifying silence.
The SNAP of a harness releasing. A THUD as Colter falls to
the floor of the capsule. Cursing. Some sounds of thrashing
around. Then...
The SPARK of a BLUE FLARE illuminates Colter's face. He's
activated a miniature signal light on his flight suit. It
begins to BLINK. Like a beacon for downed pilots afloat in
the sea. It is the only light in the otherwise dead capsule.
Up on his knees, he grasps the release handles of the EXIT
HATCH. Using all his strength he TURNS...
But the handles don't budge. The hatch remains sealed.
He gets to his feet. Can't stand up fully. The capsule is
incredibly cramped.
Rifling through a cabinet, he discovers OPERATIONAL MANUALS
in small, almost illegible type. And a small set of TOOLS.
He spreads them out on the tiny ledge. Taking a wrench, he
BANGS on the escape hatch. A deep, clanging ECHO in the
hull.
44.
So, like any pilot would, he sets about repairing his craft.
At first he puzzles over the electronics and circuitry.
Daunted by the complexity.
There's no time to lose. Using a miniature screw driver, he
begins unscrewing the monitor panel. His fingers are slow
and clumsy in the frigid cold and the screw driver slips out
of his hands."|speech
363|LATER|"Icicles have appeared over dormant air vents. Colter, ice
crystals in his hair, is shivering more violently. Much of
the capsule's electronics lay open and exposed.
Using copper wires, he's attempting to revive a row of
BATTERIES. They spark once... twice... Nothing."|speech
364|COLTER|"Come on!
Another SPARK. It shocks him. There's a puff of blue smoke.
He's burned his fingers.
But the battery now has a tiny BLINKING GREEN LIGHT.
Working fast, Colter attaches the copper wires to the leads
on the battery. From inside the engines comes a faint
electric HUM.
FFFT. The monitor awakens. Like a film projector it throws
the image of a PLAYING CARD onto the opposite side of the
craft.
Colter begins replacing the monitor components. As he does,
a pre-recorded AUDIO FILE comes on:
GOODWIN (V.O.)
-- four principle dialects of
Arabic: Egyptian, Gulf, Syrian-
Lebanese and North African. We
will now play you portions of each,
discussing the audible differences
between them.
CLIPS of SPOKEN ARABIC begin to play.
Colter continues reconstituting the computer. The monitor
fills with scrolling lines of COMPUTER CODE.
With an oddly low-tech CLANG, the heart of the machine
reawakens. The air vents come back to life. Heat starts to
return. The icicles begin to DRIP.
45.
Colter sits back in his seat, exhausted from the work.
The monitor switches to a real-time view of the LAB.
Goodwin's chair is there, but Goodwin is not in sight. In a
background distorted by the FISH-EYE LENS, various
technicians wander by."|speech
365|COLTER|"Hello? Anyone out there? It's me.
He toggles an audio jack. Then a MAN comes walking up.
Frowns into the camera, as if through the foggy lens of
another world.
It's the MAN WITH THE PIPE. The elusive Bohemian scientist
whom Colter glimpsed once before. He will be known as
RUTLEDGE."|speech
366|COLTER|"Can you hear me?
Rutledge is tinkering with the camera. The image shakes for
a moment as he adjusts it. Then puts on a headset."|speech
367|RUTLEDGE|"Project designer initiating
sequence and drives check."|speech
368|COLTER|"I'm here! I'm okay!
Rutledge checks his headset. Not sure he heard right."|speech
369|RUTLEDGE|Is someone there?|speech
370|COLTER|"Yeah. It's me. Colter.
Rutledge blinks in surprise. The blue eyes sparkling."|speech
371|RUTLEDGE|Wow! It's you.|speech
372|COLTER|"The capsule lost power. It's still
pretty cold in here."|speech
373|RUTLEDGE|"We've been working towards you from
the other side. Nice to have you
with us again. You feeling all
right?
46."|speech
374|COLTER|I think so. Who are you?|speech
375|RUTLEDGE|The name's Rutledge.|speech
376|COLTER|"They wouldn't let me talk to you
before."|speech
377|RUTLEDGE|"No, I guess not. They're pretty
anal around here.
(lights his pipe)
Don't tell them you saw me smoking
in here, okay?
His genial eccentricity is completely at odds with the
military environment. And then it occurs to Colter:"|speech
378|COLTER|You're the inventor of this thing.|speech
379|"RUTLEDGE
(SHRUGS)"|"I prefer the term project designer.
And sorry for all the secrecy.
Goodwin will be thrilled you re-
established contact."|speech
380|COLTER|"I don't want to deal with Goodwin
anymore."|speech
381|RUTLEDGE|What?|speech
382|COLTER|"Don't you understand? He's
torturing me. I'm helpless. Can't
you get me out of here?
Rutledge looks uneasy. As a scientist, he's ill-equipped to
deal with personnel issues."|speech
383|RUTLEDGE|"Why would Goodwin have it in for
you?
47."|speech
384|COLTER|"He's a remote operator. And remote
operators are risk averse pussies
who sit at control screens in the
rear while actual pilots like me
put their asses on the line in the
field."|speech
385|RUTLEDGE|"He seems pretty devoted to the
mission."|speech
386|COLTER|"And just what kind of mission is
this? Talk to me, man. Why won't
he let me save those people on the
train?"|speech
387|RUTLEDGE|Because they can't be saved.|speech
388|COLTER|"Why not? I know what's going to
happen. I could take apart the
bomb. Stop the train."|speech
389|RUTLEDGE|"Yeah but you'd be doing it in the
Source Code, not here. Not in our
own past.
Mystery upon mystery."|speech
390|COLTER|What's the difference?|speech
391|RUTLEDGE|"I'm not sure I should be telling
you this."|speech
392|COLTER|"Telling me what?
Coaxing the scientist in him."|speech
393|RUTLEDGE|"It's quantum physics. Linear
algebra. Parabolic calculus. It
would take weeks to explain."|speech
394|COLTER|"Is Source Code time travel?
48.
Rutledge sighs. Looks at his pipe."|speech
395|RUTLEDGE|It's gone out again.|speech
396|COLTER|"Why can't I save those people on
the train?"|speech
397|RUTLEDGE|"Think of it like this: events in
our past can never be undone.
Einstein proved that."|speech
398|COLTER|So...|speech
399|RUTLEDGE|"So Source Code opens up another
past for you. A parallel past. It
looks the same but it has no
intersection with our own world.
In essence, by sending you back, an
entirely new but utterly parallel
world is created. It looks
identical to ours, but nothing you
do there has any effect on this
reality.
At last some useful information. Colter races to process it."|speech
400|COLTER|"What happens to the Source Code
world after I leave it?"|speech
401|RUTLEDGE|"I don't know. You can never know
that because you're not there to
observe it. Maybe it vanishes.
Maybe not."|speech
402|(UNEASY)|I should tell them you're okay.|speech
403|COLTER|What about the bicycle?|speech
404|RUTLEDGE|What bicycle?|speech
405|COLTER|"I see it each time. Right after
the bomb goes off. Like an after
image."|speech
406|(MORE)|49.|speech
407|COLTER (CONT'D)|"There's a bicycle and a stone wall
and a girl. It's a girl from the
train. I don't know where any of
it is supposed to be, but --
Rutledge removes the pipe from his mouth."|speech
408|RUTLEDGE|"Wait. You see all this after you
leave the train?"|speech
409|COLTER|"Yeah. Just for a split second.
Rutledge is stunned. Like he's discovered some strange new
property to his invention."|speech
410|RUTLEDGE|"Please tell me you're not making
this up."|speech
411|COLTER|"No. It's there. What do you think
it means?"|speech
412|RUTLEDGE|"I don't know.
Rutledge looks off camera for a moment."|speech
413|RUTLEDGE|"They're here. There's no more time
to talk."|speech
414|(QUICKLY)|"Make sure he sends you back in.
Find out about the after images.
Goodwin appears. Rutledge reluctantly takes off his headset."|speech
415|COLTER|"Rutledge, wait. Don't leave me.
Rutledge steps away. A pointed look at Colter. Goodwin
settles back into his seat, donning the headset."|speech
416|GOODWIN|Welcome back. How are you feeling?|speech
417|COLTER|I'm alive. No thanks to you.|speech
418|GOODWIN|"You find the bomber?
50."|speech
419|COLTER|"You're a brick wall, Goodwin. A
fucking brick wall."|speech
420|GOODWIN|"Lower your pulse. The situation
has worsened. The fire on the
tracks caused one of the freight
cars to blow up and release some
kind of gas. As a precaution
they're having to evacuate all of
lower Manhattan.
Evacuate lower Manhattan? The enormity of this. Having to
take it on faith."|speech
421|GOODWIN|We may have lost the initiative.|speech
422|COLTER|"What do you mean? Let's keep
going."|speech
423|GOODWIN|We were expecting more from you.|speech
424|COLTER|"I can give you more. Let me think
for a second.
But Goodwin ignores him. Absorbed in paperwork."|speech
425|COLTER|"The freight car blows up from the
fire. It spews gas, or what could
be gas -- it might be chlorine, so
they can't take any chances.
Anxious now. Trying to make up lost ground. Whatever it
takes to get sent back in."|speech
426|COLTER|"So they decide to play it safe and
evacuate parts of New York City.
And maybe that's part of the
terrorists' plan, right?"|speech
427|(THINKING)|"So... so who benefits from that?
What's vulnerable? What's down
there in lower Manhattan?"|speech
428|(BEAT)|"Wall Street.
51.
Surprising himself with this insight.
And now Goodwin is paying attention again. Waiting for more."|speech
429|COLTER|"Wall Street. That's what they're
going to hit next. The financial
markets.
Goodwin considers this. For the first time, slightly
impressed."|speech
430|GOODWIN|I want to show you something.|speech
431|CUT TO:|"DRIVERS LICENSE PHOTOS
The video monitor shows CHRISTINA's DMV shot. Her wry,
secretive smile."|speech
432|COLTER|Did she die, too?|speech
433|GOODWIN|"Yes. This drivers license photo
was found with her body. We're
creating a database of recovered
identifications as they come in
from the site.
A pang of sorrow. Moving among ghosts."|speech
434|COLTER|You sure she's dead?|speech
435|GOODWIN|"Would you like to see her morgue
photos?"|speech
436|"COLTER

The camera ZOOMS IN on a corpse. Its burned face, like a
piece of rotted fruit, fills the screen. Nevertheless, we
recognize it. And it's not Christina. It's someone else."|speech
439|COLTER|"That's...
GOODWIN (V.O.)
Sean Fentress.
The man in the mirror. Himself, at least on the train."|speech
440|COLTER|"He died on the train.
GOODWIN (V.O.)
As a host identity, Sean Fentress
had to have certain basic
similarities to you. Gender.
Blood type. Approximate age. His
head was still intact. We need the
head, you see. To link the two of
you remotely.

leather shoe. The crisp click of someone uncapping a
fountain pen. The scenery rushing by -- the blur of trees,
the soft lavender of the morning sky. The swell and pull of
the mighty machine coursing over the rails.
If a train ride could ever be a sensory delight, this is it.
To Colter, every sensation has become even more pronounced,
more intensely real than ever.
CLOSE ON - HIS WATCH - A beep as he sets it to countdown
again from seventeen minutes. The duration of his freedom.
Across from him is Christina. Absorbed with her sketching."|speech

THUNK.
