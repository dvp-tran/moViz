3||"ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT FROM THE BACK.
A PERVERT in a trench coat runs along the edge of the
mall. A group of OLD WOMEN is coming toward the MAIN
ENTRANCE. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes
the old women. They SCREAM!
The Pervert ducks behind the bushes and runs with the
skill of a Navy SEAL. A FAMILY is walking down the
sidewalk. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes
them.
The Pervert ducks behind a dumpster. He keeps running
and sees a car driving by. The Pervert flashes the CAR.
The Pervert takes a two-step run, sees ANOTHER LADY,
flashes her. He dives behind a car. Then pops up and
flashes ANOTHER GIRL.
It's an all-out Pervert assault!
The Pervert then runs across the parking lot, jumps a
fence, and darts from the property -- vanishing as
quickly as a Ninja who just perfectly executed an
assassination."|stage direction|||

through the mall parking lot tearing up everything they
see. A couple of them smoke cigarettes. One skater
grinds over a bench. One kid ollies onto the hood of a
car. Another slams into an old man and knocks him over.
Meanwhile, Ronnie sits in his golf cart -- waiting. He
looks eerily like Mel Gibson at the beginning of Mad Max.
The skaters ride past a set of construction cones. One
skater picks up the cone and tosses it across the parking
lot.
The skaters soar past Ronnie, who flips on the silent
orange siren and gives chase.
As the skaters ride through the parking lot, Ronnie pulls
up and drives alongside of them."|stage direction|||

Ronnie pulls up alongside of a SLOW SKATER. Ronnie side-
swipes the skater, forcing the skater to run into a trash

Ronnie catches up to ANOTHER SKATER. This time, Ronnie
tries to hit the skater on the side again, but he is too
fast. Ronnie swerves trying to get him, but he dodges
and ducks. Ronnie hits the brake. The skater thinks he
has escaped, but looks up and sees that a car is in his
way. The skater nails the car and is thrown over the
hood.
Ronnie is back in the chase and only Hector and Stevie
are left. Ronnie guns the golf cart and zooms up closely
behind the two kids.
Ronnie rams Hector over and over from behind. Hector
wobbles. Ronnie rams him again. Hector goes swerving
off and falls down hard.
Ronnie doesn't break his pace and guns it toward Stevie.
Stevie is good. He turns and rides through cars, ollies
over parking blocks, and through pedestrians. Ronnie
burns down the lane beside him.
Stevie looks behind and Ronnie is nowhere in sight.    He's
in the clear.
Stevie turns back around and sees Ronnie, driving in
reverse straight towards him. Ronnie rams into the
skater and knocks the poor kid on his ass."|stage direction|||
