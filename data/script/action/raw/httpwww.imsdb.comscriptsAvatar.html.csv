QUARITCH levels his GAU-90 at the shack. His finger goes to
the firing button--
WHAM!! A six-legged BLACK DEMON tackles him.
Quaritch pivots as he falls, FIRING the cannon. It misses
Neytiri by inches. He grapples with the THANATOR as its
razor claws SCREECH over his metal armor.
THE TITANS twist and struggle. QUARITCH UNLEASHES a long
burst from the cannon. Rounds tear into the creature, which
SHRIEKS but --
NEYTIRI wills it to SMASH the cannon hard against a rock,
tearing it loose from the `suit's hand but --

crushing Neytiri.

QUARITCH TWISTS violently, ramming the knife up under the
thanator's chest armor. The creature ROARS and Quaritch flips
on top of it, stabbing.

Neytiri's legs under its great bulk. She is trapped.

crazing it with a web of cracks as QUARITCH SLICES air with
the huge knife. Jake ducks, coming up to meet the next slash
and --
SMASHES the knife hand with the cannon once -- twice -- again
-- in a furious attack -- knocking the knife flying.
QUARITCH catches him with the other arm, hurling him away.
Jake rolls just before --
THUDDD! -- the massive foot stomps down where he just was. He
scrambles up as Quaritch CHARGES and --
JAKE DUCKS another round-house, LEAPING forward to smash the
canopy again -- then again -- until it is WHITE with cracks.
Quaritch manages to GRAB the cannon barrel but --
INSIDE THE COCKPIT, he sees nothing but the sun on the
shattered glass. HE HURLS the cannon blindly, but Jake ducks.
The massive cylinder cartwheels toward the shack and --
FROM INSIDE we see it CRASH against pressure window, crazing
it but not penetrating. Jake's link sits just inside.
INSIDE THE COCKPIT, Quaritch yanks a yellow handle and --

Quaritch can see again. He dons his breathing mask. Bends to
pick up his KNIFE.

NEYTIRI STANDS -- a FURY released. A classic archer figure,
she NOCKS another arrow. Then draws and releases smoothly.
TH-WHAP! The machine TOPPLES off Jake and lies still.
QUARITCH STARES at the two arrows in his chest. He touches
the feathers of the ancient weapon, then -- with an ironic
laugh -- he dies.
