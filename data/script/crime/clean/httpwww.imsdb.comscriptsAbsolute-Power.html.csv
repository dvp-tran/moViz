4||"The saddest eyes you ever saw.
We are looking at an El Greco drawing.       It is a study for
one of his paintings.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL --
A bunch of art students are doing sketches of the eyes,
the elongated fingers, the slender hands El Greco drew so
brilliantly.
Most of the students are around 20.        A couple of suburban
housewives are there too.
And one older man.
This is LUTHER WHITNEY. Mid 60s, very fit, neatly
dressed. At quick glance, he seems as if he might be a
successful company executive.
As we watch him draw we can tell he is capable of great
concentration. And patient. With eyes that miss
nothing: He has pilot's eyes.
We'll find out more about him as time goes on, but this
is all you really have to know: Luther Whitney is the
hero of this piece. As we watch him draw --
Luther's sketchbook. He is finishing his work on the
eyes, and he's caught the sadness: It's good stuff.
Luther. It's not good enough for him.        He looks at his
work a moment, shakes his head.
GIRL STUDENT
Don't give up.
LUTHER
I never do.
GIRL STUDENT
May I?
She's indicated his sketchbook.      He nods.   She starts
thumbing through.
The sketchbook as the pages turn.
Detail work. Eyes and hands. The eyes are good.         The
hands are better. Very skillful.

Beside the candle is Luther's sketch pad. Now Luther
himself moves INTO VIEW, carrying a tray. He puts it

sprinkled neatly on top. An elegant green salad is on
another plate, covered with thinly sliced parmesan

Clearly, a great deal of thought has gone into dinner.
Luther lights the single candle. We are now aware of a

girl stands in the center, smiling. Her mother stands
alongside, smiling too. A man is with them, looking at
