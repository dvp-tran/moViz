2||INT. COFFEE SHOP – MORNING|location
3||"A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles.
It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed,
there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching
on bacon and eating eggs.
Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The
Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and,
like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're
going out of style.
It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or
how old she is; everything she does contradicts something
she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is
to be said in a rapid pace ""HIS GIRL FRIDAY"" fashion."|stage direction
4|YOUNG MAN|"No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm
through doin' that shit."|speech
5|YOUNG WOMAN|"You always say that, the same thing
every time: never again, I'm through,
too dangerous."|speech
6|YOUNG MAN|"I know that's what I always say. I'm
always right too, but –"|speech
7|YOUNG WOMAN|"– but you forget about it in a day
or two -"|speech
8|YOUNG MAN|"– yeah, well, the days of me
forgittin' are over, and the days of
me rememberin' have just begun."|speech
9|YOUNG WOMAN|"When you go on like this, you know
what you sound like?"|speech
10|YOUNG MAN|"I sound like a sensible fucking man,
is what I sound like."|speech
11|YOUNG WOMAN|You sound like a duck.|speech
12||(imitates a duck)|location
13|YOUNG WOMAN|"Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,
quack, quack..."|speech
14|YOUNG MAN|"Well take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna hafta hear it again. Because
since I'm never gonna do it again,
you're never gonna hafta hear me
quack about how I'm never gonna do
it again."|speech
15|YOUNG WOMAN|After tonight.|speech
16||"The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in
there, back and forth."|stage direction
17||(with a smile)|location
18|YOUNG MAN|Correct. I got all tonight to quack.|speech
19||A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.|stage direction
20|WAITRESS|Can I get anybody anymore coffee?|speech
21|YOUNG WOMAN|Oh yes, thank you.|speech
22||"The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man
lights up another cigarette."|stage direction
23|YOUNG MAN|I'm doin' fine.|speech
24||"The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his
smoke.
The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her
coffee.
The Young Man goes right back into it."|stage direction
25|YOUNG MAN|"I mean the way it is now, you're
takin' the same fuckin' risk as when
you rob a bank. You take more of a
risk. Banks are easier!  Federal
banks aren't supposed to stop you
anyway, during a robbery. They're
insured, why should they care? You
don't even need a gun in a federal
bank. I heard about this guy, walked
into a federal bank with a portable
phone, handed the phone to the teller,
the guy on the other end of the phone
said: ""We got this guy's little girl,
and if you don't give him all your
money, we're gonna kill 'er."""|speech
26|YOUNG WOMAN|Did it work?|speech
27|YOUNG MAN|"Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm
talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in
a bank with a telephone, not a pistol,
not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone,
cleans the place out, and they don't
lift a fuckin' finger."|speech
28|YOUNG WOMAN|Did they hurt the little girl?|speech
29|YOUNG MAN|"I don't know. There probably never
was a little girl – the point of the
story isn't the little girl. The
point of the story is they robbed
the bank with a telephone."|speech
30|YOUNG WOMAN|You wanna rob banks?|speech
31|YOUNG MAN|"I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks,
I'm just illustrating that if we
did, it would be easier than what we
been doin'."|speech
32|YOUNG WOMAN|So you don't want to be a bank robber?|speech
33|YOUNG MAN|"Naw, all those guys are goin' down
the same road, either dead or servin'
twenty."|speech
34|YOUNG WOMAN|And no more liquor stores?|speech
35|YOUNG MAN|"What have we been talking about?
Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides,
it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too
many foreigners own liquor stores.
Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't
fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em:
""Empty out the register,"" and they
don't know what it fuckin' means.
They make it too personal. We keep
on, one of those gook motherfuckers'
gonna make us kill 'em."|speech
36|YOUNG WOMAN|I'm not gonna kill anybody.|speech
37|YOUNG MAN|"I don't wanna kill anybody either.
But they'll probably put us in a
situation where it's us of them. And
if it's not the gooks, it these old
Jews who've owned the store for
fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got
Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the
counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try
walkin' into one of those stores
with nothin' but a telephone, see
how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget
it, we're out of it."|speech
38|YOUNG WOMAN|Well, what else is there, day jobs?|speech
39||(laughing)|location
40|YOUNG MAN|Not this life.|speech

48|WAITRESS|"""Garcon"" means boy."|speech
49||She splits.|stage direction
50|YOUNG WOMAN|Here? It's a coffee shop.|speech
51|YOUNG MAN|"What's wrong with that? People never
rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor
stores, gas stations, you get your
head blown off stickin' up one of
them. Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.
They're not expecting to get robbed,
or not as expecting."|speech
52||(taking to idea)|location
53|YOUNG WOMAN|"I bet in places like this you could
cut down on the hero factor."|speech
54|YOUNG MAN|"Correct. Just like banks, these places
are insured. The managers don't give
a fuck, they're just tryin' to get
ya out the door before you start
pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget
it, they ain't takin' a bullet for
the register. Busboys, some wetback
gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour
gonna really give a fuck you're
stealin' from the owner. Customers
are sittin' there with food in their
mouths, they don't know what's goin'
on. One minute they're havin' a Denver
omelet, next minute somebody's
stickin' a gun in their face."|speech
55||"The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man
continues in a low voice."|stage direction
56|YOUNG MAN|"See, I got the idea last liquor store
we stuck up. 'Member all those
customers kept comin' in?"|speech
57|YOUNG WOMAN|Yeah.|speech
58|YOUNG MAN|"Then you got the idea to take
everybody's wallet."|speech
59|YOUNG WOMAN|Uh-huh.|speech
60|YOUNG MAN|That was a good idea.|speech
61|YOUNG WOMAN|Thanks.|speech
62|YOUNG MAN|"We made more from the wallets then
we did the register."|speech
63|YOUNG WOMAN|Yes we did.|speech
64|YOUNG MAN|A lot of people go to restaurants.|speech
65|YOUNG WOMAN|A lot of wallets.|speech
66|YOUNG MAN|Pretty smart, huh?|speech
67||"The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new
information.
She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The
tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the
motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the
COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's
face."|stage direction

71|YOUNG MAN|"Remember, same as before, you're
crowd control, I handle the employees."|speech
72|YOUNG WOMAN|Got it.|speech
73||"They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on
the table. He looks at her and she back at him."|stage direction
74|YOUNG WOMAN|I love you, Pumpkin.|speech
75|YOUNG MAN|I love you, Honey Bunny.|speech
76||"And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons,
stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona
is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is
that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon."|stage direction

86|VINCENT|What so you want to know?|speech
87|JULES|Well, hash is legal there, right?|speech
88|VINCENT|"Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a
hundred percent legal. I mean you
can't walk into a restaurant, roll a
joint, and start puffin' away. You're
only supposed to smoke in your home
or certain designated places."|speech
89|JULES|Those are hash bars?|speech
90|VINCENT|"Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's
legal to buy it, it's legal to own
it and, if you're the proprietor of
a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
It's legal to carry it, which doesn't
really matter 'cause – get a load of
this – if the cops stop you, it's
illegal for this to search you.
Searching you is a right that the
cops in Amsterdam don't have."|speech

that's all there is to it."|speech

what the funniest thing about Europe
is?"|speech
93|JULES|What?|speech
94|VINCENT|"It's the little differences. A lotta
the same shit we got here, they got
there, but there they're a little
different."|speech
95|JULES|Examples?|speech
96|VINCENT|"Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer
in a movie theatre. And I don't mean
in a paper cup either. They give you
a glass of beer, like in a bar. In
Paris, you can buy beer at
MacDonald's. Also, you know what
they call a Quarter Pounder with
Cheese in Paris?"|speech

with Cheese?"|speech

an invention called television, and
on that invention they show shows?"|speech
136|VINCENT|Yeah.|speech
137|JULES|"Well, the way they pick the shows on
TV is they make one show, and that
show's called a pilot. And they show
that one show to the people who pick
the shows, and on the strength of
that one show, they decide if they
want to make more shows. Some get
accepted and become TV programs, and

is nothing, I give my mother a foot
massage."|speech

a bitch a foot massage ain't even
the same fuckin' thing."|speech

172|JULES|"It ain't no ballpark either. Look
maybe your method of massage differs
from mine, but touchin' his lady's
feet, and stickin' your tongue in
her holyiest of holyies, ain't the
same ballpark, ain't the same league,
ain't even the same fuckin' sport.

right, man. Motherfucker do that to
me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause
I'd kill'a motherfucker."|speech
192|VINCENT|"I'm not sayin' he was right, but
you're sayin' a foot massage don't
mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does.
I've given a million ladies a million
foot massages and they all meant
somethin'. We act like they don't,
but they do. That's what's so fuckin'
cool about 'em. This sensual thing's
goin' on that nobody's talkin about,

fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan
shoulda known fuckin' better. That's
his fuckin' wife, man. He ain't gonna

shit."|speech

let's get into character."|speech

because she grew up in a circus, she
was also something of an acrobat.
She could do illusions, she was a
trapeze artist – when you're keeping
the world safe from evil, you never
know when being a trapeze artist's
gonna come in handy. And she knew a
zillion old jokes her grandfather,

overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It
feels good.
Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch.
Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco
on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks
the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a
little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so
anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out
his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg,
trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you
know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly
brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up,
then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.
The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she
takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in
the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something
else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder

868|CAPT. KOONS|"This watch I got here was first
purchased by your great-granddaddy.
It was bought during the First World
War in a little general store in
Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought
by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge
the day he set sail for Paris. It
was your great-granddaddy's war watch,
made by the first company to ever
make wrist watches. You see, up until
then, people just carried pocket
watches. Your great-granddaddy wore
that watch every day he was in the
war. Then when he had done his duty,
he went home to your great-
grandmother, took the watch off his
wrist and put it in an ol' coffee
can. And in that can it stayed 'til
your grandfather Dane Coolidge was
called upon by his country to go
overseas and fight the Germans once
again. This time they called it World
War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave
it to your granddad for good luck.
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as
good as his old man's. Your granddad
was a Marine and he was killed with
all the other Marines at the battle
of Wake Island. Your granddad was
facing death and he knew it. None of
those boys had any illusions about
ever leavin' that island alive. So
three days before the Japanese took
the island, your 22-year old
grandfather asked a gunner on an Air
Force transport named Winocki, a man
he had never met before in his life,
to deliver to his infant son, who he
had never seen in the flesh, his
gold watch. Three days later, your
grandfather was dead. But Winocki
kept his word. After the war was
over, he paid a visit to your
grandmother, delivering to your infant
father, his Dad's gold watch. This
watch. This watch was on your Daddy's
wrist when he was shot down over
Hanoi. He was captured and put in a
Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew
if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd
be confiscated. The way your Daddy
looked at it, that watch was your
birthright. And he'd be damned if
and slopeheads were gonna put their
greasy yella hands on his boy's
birthright. So he hid it in the one
place he knew he could hide somethin'.
His ass. Five long years, he wore
this watch up his ass. Then when he
died of dysentery, he gave me the
watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass for two years.
Then, after seven years, I was sent
home to my family. And now, little
man, I give the watch to you."|speech

in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other,
all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both
share at what they've gotten themselves into.
Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even
more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible.
The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is
a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and

On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected
to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he
stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their
way with Marsellus.
Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in
a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the
pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in
with.
He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards
it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks
about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large
Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots
what he's been looking for:
A Samurai sword.
It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the
wall, next to a neon ""DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER"" sign.
Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its
sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten
in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his
thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not
on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems
made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the
sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears

Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword
behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing
the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.

matter. You're judging this thing
the wrong way. It's not about what.
It could be God stopped the bullets,
he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found
my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge
shit like this based on merit. Whether
or not what we experienced was an
according-to-Hoyle miracle is
insignificant. What is significant
is I felt God's touch, God got
involved."|speech

the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is
he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of the darkness. For he
is truly his brother's keeper and
the finder of lost children. And I
will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know I am the
Lord when I lay my vengeance upon
you."" I been sayin' that shit for
years.  And if you ever heard it, it
meant your ass. I never really
questioned what it meant. I thought
it was just a coldblooded thing to
say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped
a cap in his ass. But I saw some
shit this mornin' made me think twice.
Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're
the evil man. And I'm the righteous
man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the
shepherd protecting my righteous ass
in the valley of darkness. Or is
could by you're the righteous man
and I'm the shepherd and it's the
world that's evil and selfish.  I'd
like that. But that shit ain't the
truth. The truth is you're the weak.
And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But
I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to
be a shepherd."|speech
