To the island village of Berk, festively adorned with flags
and banners. Major new additions alter its familiar skyline.
HICCUP (V.O.)
This... is Berk. The best kept
secret this side of, well,
anywhere. Granted, it may not look
like much, but this wet heap of
rock packs more than a few
surprises."|speech|unknown|M|

shadows of passing dragons race by. The group moves as one,
receding into a shadowy alley, pushing one sheep out into the
light. It's suddenly snatched and carried into the air!"|stage direction|||
6|unknown|"HICCUP (V.O.)
Life here is amazing, just not for
the faint of heart. See, where most
folks enjoy hobbies like whittling
or needlepoint, we Berkians prefer
a little something we like to call--"|speech|unknown|M|
7||"WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH! A wash of VIBRANT COLORS blurs by.
DRAGONS BARREL PAST at a dizzying speed. Their RIDERS SWIPE,
KICK, and ROLL into one another while they WEAVE neck in neck
between the houses, docks, and revamped structures of Berk."|stage direction|||

Spectators ROAR from wooden bleachers, fastened to cliff
faces and perched over the sea.
FISHLEGS, now 20 and even larger, rides his gronkle, MEATLUG,
who carries the sheep in her claws, until...
SNOTLOUT, also 20, but every bit as juvenile, and his
Monstrous Nightmare, HOOKFANG, steal the sheep from them."|stage direction|||

this place, Belch!"|speech|TUFFNUT|F|True

leaving Snotlout behind in the smoke.
As they rush past the main bleachers, Ruffnut DROPS her sheep
into one of five baskets suspended over a chasm at the lap

Yep. Berk is pretty much perfect.
All of my hard work has paid off.
And it's a good thing, too, because

freedom."|stage direction|||

84||"Tucked into his riding position, HICCUP appears to be part of
TOOTHLESS. They dip, roll and dive, over a sea teeming with
Thunderdrums, pulling off daring maneuvers with honed
refinement, making them seem effortless."|stage direction|||
85|HICCUP|Yeah!|speech|HICCUP|M|True
86||"They jackknife, heading skyward, rolling and tumbling through
the ethereal cloud-scapes and joining high-flying Timberjacks
as they soar in formation.
Hiccup is bound head-to-toe in a snug, aerodynamic flight
suit -- an asymmetrical, functional design of leather and
articulated plates. It has an air of Viking bike leather."|stage direction|||

this another shot?"|speech|HICCUP|M|True

tail position. Hiccup then unhooks himself from the saddle."|stage direction|||
91|HICCUP (CONT'D)|Ready?|speech|HICCUP|M|True
92||"Toothless SNORTS unenthusiastically.
Suddenly, Hiccup SLIDES OFF of Toothless, peeling away from
him like a skydiver from a plane, YELLING as he plummets.
Toothless dives after him. They spiral through the air, face-
to-face. Toothless is having fun, despite himself.
Hiccup slips his forearms through a pair of tucked leather
flaps... and YANKS, unfurling SHEETS OF LEATHER as he extends
his arms. They catch the wind, SNAPPING OPEN like WINGS...
and sending him GLIDING -- out of control, at first, then
stabilizing. The turbulence buffets his flight suit heavily.
But he's flying!
Toothless unfolds his wings, too, catching up with Hiccup.
The freedom is palpable. Hiccup and Toothless are, for the
moment, the same. Feeling the same rush of adrenaline.
Independently together.
They PLUNGE past cloud formations, splitting apart then
crossing paths again."|stage direction|||

Toothless launches fireballs ahead of Hiccup, boosting him
higher with the expanding heat bursts."|stage direction|||

96||"A cloud layer washes past, exposing a towering ROCK
FORMATION, dead ahead."|stage direction|||
97|HICCUP (CONT'D)|No longer amazing! Toothless!|speech|HICCUP|M|True
98||"Hiccup tries to steer himself away, to no avail.
Toothless POURS ON THE SPEED, trying to catch Hiccup as he
HURTLES toward collision. His locked tail makes maneuvering
difficult. He's UNABLE TO PULL UP at a steep enough angle."|stage direction|||
99|HICCUP (CONT'D)|Oh, no!|speech|HICCUP|M|True
100||"At the last second, Toothless BLASTS the jagged rocks just
ahead of Hiccup, then WRAPS Hiccup in his wings as they fly
through it. The obliterated peak rains down around them.
Toothless emerges through the cloud of debris and HURTLES
into the trees of a neighboring peak. They tumble down the
uneven terrain, coming to rest on a small plateau.
Hiccup emerges from the cocoon of Toothless' wings. He
switches his prosthetic riding foot to his walking foot and
stows his leather wings."|stage direction|||

103|HICCUP (CONT'D)|"We gotta work on your solo gliding
there, bud. That locked-up tail
makes for some pretty sloppy rescue
maneuvers, eh?"|speech|HICCUP|M|True
104||"Hiccup reels in his dorsal fin and removes his helmet,
revealing a 20 year old Hiccup framed by wild hair, complete
with a Viking braid.
He walks to the edge of the cliff, taking in the NEW LAND
stretching off into the horizon, its tall cliffs and sea-
stacks adorned with swaying gold birch trees basking in the
dappled afternoon sunlight."|stage direction|||

bud."|speech|HICCUP|M|True
107||"Toothless FUSSES and SNORTS, not amused, shaking off dust and
pebbles like a wet dog.
Hiccup flinches as a pebble WHACKS him on the back of the
head. He looks back to Toothless, who averts his eyes."|stage direction|||

Is that why you're pouting, big
baby boo? Well... try this on!"|speech|HICCUP|M|True
109||Hiccup TACKLES Toothless and tries to put him in a headlock.|stage direction|||
110|HICCUP (CONT'D)|"Ya feeling it yet? Huh? Picking up
on all my heartfelt remorse?"|speech|HICCUP|M|True
111||"Toothless simply stands on his hind legs, lifting Hiccup off
of his flailing feet and dangling him over the cliff's edge."|stage direction|||

win! You win!"|speech|HICCUP|M|True

Hiccup squirms, throwing mock punches. Toothless playfully
retaliates with feline taps to Hiccup's head."|stage direction|||

and Vikings, enemies again, locked
in combat to the bitter -- URFFF!"|speech|HICCUP|M|True
117||"Toothless rests his head on Hiccup -- SQUEEZING THE AIR out
of him. Toothless then suddenly starts grooming Hiccup,
lapping at his face and covering him in slobber."|stage direction|||

shaking off the viscous saliva."|stage direction|||

122||"Toothless LAUGHS, pleased with himself.
Shifting his attention back to the new land stretched out
before them, Hiccup reaches beneath his chest plate and
produces a leather-bound book.
He unfurls it to reveal an EXPLORERS MAP, modified with added
strips in every direction to accommodate their ever-expanding
world. Drawings indicate new lands, new tribes, and many new
dragons.
Hiccup peels a fresh strip of paper from a hidden fold in his
flight suit and holds it out for Toothless to lick.
Hiccup affixes the moistened strip to the map's outer edge,
then whittles a pencil and consults a compass affixed to his
forearm."|stage direction|||
