CODA
Bluntman and Chronic Strike Back went on to make a mere 2.3
million at the box office. It was the biggest commercial
failure in the history of Miramax films.  The film was roundly
drubbed as a bad idea by the denizens of the Internet chat
boards, and over the course of the next year, while they
waited for the Quick Stop restraining order to expire, Jay
and Silent Bob tracked them all down and beat the shit out
of them.
