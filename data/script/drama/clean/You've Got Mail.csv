CYBERSPACE
We have a sense of cyberspace-travel as we hurtle through a
sky that's just beginning to get light.  There are a few
stars but they fade and the sky turns a milky blue and a big
computer sun starts to rise.
We continue hurtling through space and see that we're heading
over a computer version of the New York City skyline.  We
move over Central Park.  It's fall and the leaves are
glorious reds and yellows.
We reach the West Side of Manhattan and move swiftly down
Broadway with its stores and gyms and movies theatres and"|stage direction||

increase from 0% to 100%.  When it hits 100% the image pops and
we are in real life."|stage direction||
