changes, Kimble and Helen demonstrate an oft-used exchange
of glances: Kimble, while gracious to his dinner partners,
catches Helen's eye and makes smiling, subtle movements to
his watch or a look to the door to indicate he's clearly
ready to leave. On the receiving end, Helen, the gatekeeper
of their social propriety, indicates with equal subtlety:
""not yet.""
As we MOVE AROUND the table we hear:
""Where's your husband on staff?"" ""My husband's an orthopod
at Northwestern."" ""I'm working on a new technique...""
""That's fascinating..."" ""That's quite a marvelous dress
you're wearing."" ""Do you like it? My husband says it's a

where Gerard enters.
ON GERARD
The door closes automatically behind Gerard and Renfro.
They enter the noisy main room and separate. Renfro moves
up the far side of the room, Gerard up the center. Both
move slowly through the maze of bags, carts, automated
equipment."|stage direction

night of the murder and called
Sykes from it."|speech
1754||"RENFRO
Separated from Gerard. He hears a NOISE behind him - a bag
comes down the track at break-neck speed, Renfro spins,
dodges it, gets his bearings and continues.
KIMBLE
Listening. He watches the movement of bags as he did with
Nichols.
GERARD
Moving through the forest of massive bags."|stage direction
1755|GERARD|"... That's why there was no forced
entry at your house. He'd used your
keys."|speech
1756||"KIMBLE
Realizing what Gerard knows. Considering his next move.
NICHOLS
Also listening. He realizes Gerard now knows he's the
killer. He moves behind the water softener tanks and
chemicals - and spots Renfro - and something else -the
hanging control for the I-beam.
GERARD
Moves carefully. Another bag comes down the track. He
dodges it and steps into an open track. From here he can
see straight back toward the washers."|stage direction
1757|GERARD|Kimble... Come meet me out here.|speech
1758||"ON RENFRO
He steps out and then back as a bag shoots by. He ducks
under the bag - into the next track and suddenly hears a
WHIRRING sound behind him. Renfro turns as an I-beam comes
rushing down the open track and knocks him to the floor,
opening a gash across the side of his head. He lays still.
NICHOLS
Steps out of the shadows, turns him over exposing his empty
shoulder harness and takes the gun from Renfro's hand.
Nichols moves toward Gerard with the gun.
GERARD
Oblivious to this action, moves on, passes the conveyor
belts. He makes one last appeal."|stage direction
1759|GERARD|"It's time to quit running... if you
don't, you know I'll stop you. He
listens, there is no answer."|speech
1760||"KIMBLE
Starts to move out to meet Gerard, sees Renfro down. His
shoulder harness is empty. He knows Nichols is armed.
GERARD
Moves into the alley between the two giant washers. He
pauses, looks back, then continues, when he turns his back
on us...
NICHOLS
Steps INTO FRAME behind him and slowly takes aim. Just
before he fires however he hears..."|stage direction
1761|KIMBLE (O.S.)|Hey, Chuckles...|speech
1762||"Nichols turns toward the voice as Kimble swings the stick
and clocks him - sending the gun skittering on the floor
behind Gerard.
GERARD
Turns on the sound and finds his gun trained on Kimble
with Nichols at his feet, unconscious. He realizes
instantly that Kimble saved his life and lowers his gun.
Kimble, exhausted, leans against the washer.
They hold a look as deputies and police flood into the
room surrounding Kimble and handcuffing him."|stage direction
