Jackie stands still as a people-mover slowly inches her
through the airport. The CREDITS APEAR and DISAPPEAR in
front of her.
Jackie Brown is a very attractive black woman in her mid
forties, though she looks like she's in her mid-thirties.
The people-mover reaches the end of the line, she steps
off.
She breezes through Customs and we follow her with a
STEDICAM as she strides through the airport... She gets
to her gate disappears inside the plane for a moment
comes back out sans flight bag picks up the microphone."|stage direction

18||INT. MELANIE'S BEAHC APARTMENT - NIGHT|location
19||"The Black Voice belong to forty-five-year old ORDELL
ROBBIE.
Ordell wears clothes nice and likes wearing nice clothes.
Stylish, athletic wear (Reebok), heavy, black leather
jackets (Hugo Boss), warm-colored berets and baseball
caps to cover his balding head are Ordell's ""look."" At
this moment Ordell's wearing an open silk shirt.
Ordell narrates the video playing on the big-screen V.
(the most expensive thing in the apartment). He holds a
cocktail in one hand (screwdriver, his drink of choice)
and the remote control in the other, pacing the floor in
his I-can-talk-anybody-into-anything voice.
LOUIS GARA, who looks like he does his shopping at the
Salvation Army (dressed in a Hawaiian shirt and
dungarees), sits on the sofa staring blankly at the
video, drinking Jack Daniels on ice. Louis, white, also
in his mid forties, has lived over half of his life in
penal institutions. The experience has affected both his
body language and his thought process.
While acutely aware of the rhythm of life inside a
correction facility, in the real world his timing is
thrown. It's like a song he doesn't know the lyrics to
but attempt to sing anyway.
The third person watching the video is the person who
lives in this apartment, MELANIE RALSTON. Melanie, thirty-
three, is a tanned, blonde, California beach bunny. Like
the kind you se in the old Crown International movies
from the seventies like ""Pom Pom Girls"" ""Malibu Beach""
and ""Beach Girls,"" except Melanie is older than any of
those girls ever are. She's dressed in her Melanie-
uniform of stringy Levis cutoffs and a stringy bra top.
So far Melanie has been able to make a living out of
lying in the sun, always finding a generous, wealthy man
more than willing to pay her rent and pick up her tabs.
In her prime (twenty two) it was Japanese industrialists,
film production guys, and Middle Eastern businessmen who
kept Melanie. And it was places like the Bahamas,
Acapulco, and the Virgin Islands where they kept her.
But now, at thirty three, she lives in an apartment in
Hermosa Beach, California that Ordell pays for an drops
in and out of. She's curled up in a reclining chair,
smoking weed from a pipe, reading Movieline Magazine and
paying no attention to the video."|stage direction
20|ORDELL|"This TEC-9? They advertise it as
being the most popular gun in
American crime. Can you believe that
shit? It actually says that on the
little booklet that comes with it.
""Most Popular Gun in American Crime,""
like they're proud of that shit."|speech

Okay you want another bond, and you
want to move over the ten thousand

sixteen thousand, with retirement
benefits , ain't worth a damn. And
now with this arrest hanging over my
