Episode VI
RETURN OF THE JEDI
Luke Skywalker has returned to his home planet of Tatooine in an
attempt to rescue his friend Han Solo from the clutches of the vile
gangster Jabba the Hutt. Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC EMPIRE
has secretly begun construction on a new armored space station even
more powerful than the first dreaded Death Star. When completed, this
ultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of Rebels
struggling to restore freedom to the galaxy...
PAN DOWN to reveal a monstrous half-completed Death Star, its massive
superstructure curling away from the completed section like the arms of
a giant octopus. Beyond, in benevolent contrast, floats the small,
green moon of ENDOR.
An Imperial Star Destroyer moves overhead toward the massive armored
space station, followed by two zipping TIE fighters. A small Imperial
shuttle rockets from the main bay of the ship and hustles toward the
Death Star.
2    INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT
The shuttle captain makes contact with the Death Star.
SHUTTLE CAPTAIN
Command station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting
our approach. Deactivate the security shield.
DEATH STAR CONTROLLER	(filtered VO)
The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have
confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to
proceed.
SHUTTLE CAPTAIN
We're starting our approach.
3    INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM
Operators move about among the control panels. A SHIELD OPERATOR hits
switches beside a large screen, on which is a display of the Death
Star, the moon Endor, and a bright web delineating the invisible
deflector shield.
A control officer rushes over to the shield operator.
OFFICER
Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.
OPERATOR
Yes, sir.
The control officer moves to a view port and watches as the Imperial
shuttle lands in the massive docking bay. A squad of Imperial
stormtroopers moves into formation before the craft.
4    INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY
The DEATH STAR COMMANDER, MOFF JERJERROD, a tall, confident technocrat,
strides through the assembled troops to the base of the shuttle ramp.
The troops snap to attention; many are uneasy about the new arrival.
But the Death Star commander stands arrogantly tall.
The exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a WHOOSH, revealing only
darkness. Then, heavy FOOTSTEPS AND MECHANICAL BREATHING. From this
black void appears DARTH VADER, LORD OF THE SITH. Vader looks over the
assemblage as he walks down the ramp.
JERJERROD
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your
presence.
VADER
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you
back on
schedule.
The commander turns ashen and begins to shake.
JERJERROD
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.
VADER
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
JERJERROD
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
VADER
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
JERJERROD
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
VADER
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
JERJERROD	 (aghast)
The Emperor's coming here?
VADER
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your
apparent lack of progress.
JERJERROD
We shall double our efforts.
VADER
I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as
I am.
5    EXT ROAD TO JABBA'S PALACE - TATOOINE
A lonely, windswept road meanders through the desolate Tatooine
terrain. We HEAR a familiar BEEPING and a distinctive reply before
catching sight of ARTOO-DETOO and SEE-THREEPIO, making their way along
the road toward the ominous palace of Jabba the Hutt.
THREEPIO
Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. Lando Calrissian and
poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.
Artoo whistles timidly.
THREEPIO
Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this
Jabba the Hutt, you'd probably short-circuit.
The two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace.
THREEPIO
Artoo, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose.
6    EXT JABBA'S PALACE - GATE
Threepio looks around for some kind of signaling device, then timidly
knocks on the iron door.
THREEPIO	 (instantly)
There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master
Luke.
A small hatch in the middle of the door opens and a spidery mechanical
arm, with a large electronic eyeball on the end, pops out and inspects
the two droids.
STRANGE VOICE
Tee chuta hhat yudd!
THREEPIO
Goodness gracious me!"|stage direction
1|"The eye looks from one robot to the other, there is a laugh then the
eye zips back into the door. The hatch slams shut. Artoo beeps his
concern.
THREEPIO
I don't think they're going to let us in, Artoo. We'd better go.
Artoo beeps his reluctance as Threepio turns to leave. Suddenly the
massive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic SCREECH. The
robots turn back and face an endless black cavity. The droids look at
one another, afraid to enter.
Artoo starts forward into the gloom. Threepio rushes after his stubby
companion. The door lowers noisily behind them.
THREEPIO
Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really don't think we should
rush into all this.
Artoo continues down the corridor, with Threepio following.
THREEPIO
Oh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!
7    INT JABBA'S PALACE - HALLWAY
The door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the dark
passageway. The frightened robots are met by two giant, green GAMORREAN
GUARDS, who fall in behind them. Threepio glances quickly back at the
two lumbering brutes, then back to Artoo. One guard grunts an order.
Artoo beeps nervously.
THREEPIO
Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my!
Oh! Oh, no.
Walking toward them out of the darkness is BIB FORTUNA, a humanlike
alien with long tentacles protruding from his skull.
BIB
Die Wanna Wanga!
THREEPIO
Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master,
Jabba the Hutt.
Artoo lets out a series of quick beeps.
THREEPIO	 (cont)
...and a gift.
(thinks a moment, then to Artoo)
Gift, what gift?
Bib shakes his head negatively.
BIB
Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.
Bib holds out his hand toward Artoo and the tiny droid backs up a bit,
letting out a protesting array of squeaks. Threepio turns to the
strange-looking alien.
THREEPIO
He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.
Bib thinks about this for a moment.
THREEPIO
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort
of things.
Bib gestures for the droids to follow.
BIB
Nudd Chaa.
The droids follow the tall, tentacled alien into the darkness, trailed
by the two guards.
THREEPIO
Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.
8    INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM
The throne room is filled with the vilest, most grotesque CREATURES
ever conceived in the universe. Artoo and Threepio seem very small as
they pause in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber. Light shafts
partially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib Fortuna crosses the
room to the platform upon which rests the leader of this nauseating
crowd: JABBA THE HUTT. The monarch of the galactic underworld is a
repulsive blob of bloated fat with a maniacal grin. Chained to the
horrible creature is the beautiful alien female dancer named OOLA. At
the foot of the dais sits an obnoxious birdlike creature, SALACIOUS
CRUMB. Bib whispers something in the slobbering degenerate's ear. Jabba
laughs horribly, at the two terrified droids before him. Threepio bows
politely.
THREEPIO
Good morning.
JABBA
Bo Shuda!
The robots jump forward to stand before the repulsive, loose-skinned
villain.
THREEPIO
The message, Artoo, the message.
Artoo whistles, and a beam of light projects from his domed head,
creating a hologram of LUKE on the floor. The image grows to over ten
feet tall, and the young Jedi towers over the space gangsters.
LUKE
Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke
Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are
powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally
powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's
life.
(Jabba's crowd laughs)
With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which
will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant
confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift:
these two droids.
Threepio is startled by this announcement.
THREEPIO
What did he say?
LUKE	 (cont)
... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.
THREEPIO
This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message.
Luke's hologram disappears.
Jabba laughs while Bib speaks to him in Huttese.
JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
There will be no bargain.
THREEPIO
We're doomed.
JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he
is.
Jabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the throne.
Hanging high, flat against the wall, exactly as we saw him last, is a
carbonized HAN SOLO.
THREEPIO
Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.
9    INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR
One of Jabba's Gamorrean guards marches Artoo and Threepio down a dank,
shadowy passageway lined with holding cells. The cries of unspeakable
creatures bounce off the cold stone walls. Occasionally a repulsive arm
or tentacle grabs through the bars at the hapless droids. Artoo beeps
pitifully.
THREEPIO
What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did?
He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!
A large tentacle wraps around Threepio's neck. He manages to break
free, and they move on to a door at the end of the corridor.
10   INT BOILER ROOM
The door slides open, revealing a room filled with steam and noisy
machinery. The guard motions them into the boiler room, where they are
met by a tall, thin humanlike robot named EV-9D9. Behind the robot can
be seen a torture rack pulling the legs off a screaming baby work
droid. A second power droid is upside down.  As smoking branding irons
are pressed into his feet, the stubby robot lets out an agonized
electronic scream. Artoo and Threepio cringe as the guard grunts to EV-
9D9.
NINEDENINE
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?
THREEPIO
I am See-Threepio, human-cy...
NINEDENINE
Yes or no will do.
THREEPIO
Oh. Well, yes.
NINEDENINE
How many languages do you speak?
THREEPIO
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can
readily...
NINEDENINE
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got
angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.
THREEPIO
Disintegrated?
NINEDENINE	 (to a Gamorrean guard)
Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining
bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.
The guard shoves Threepio toward the door.
THREEPIO	 (disappearing)
Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!
Artoo lets out a plaintive cry as the door closes. Then he beeps
angrily.
NINEDENINE
You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have
need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in
nicely.
The poor work droid in the background lets out another tortured
electronic scream.
11   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM
The court of Jabba the Hutt is in the midst of a drunken, raucous
party. Sloppy, smelly monsters cheer and make rude noises as Oola and a
fat female dancer perform in front of Jabba's throne.
Jabba leers at the dancers and with a lustful gleam in his eye beckons
Oola to come and sit with him. She stops dancing and backs away,
shaking her head. Jabba gets angry and points to a spot next to him.
JABBA
Da Eitha!
The lovely alien shakes her head again and screams.
OOLA
Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...
Jabba is furious and pulls her toward him, tugging on the chain.
JABBA
Boscka!
He pushes a button and, before the dancer can flee, a trap door in the
floor springs open and swallows her up. As the door snaps shut, a
muffled growl is followed by a hideous scream. Jabba and his monstrous
friends laugh hysterically and several revelers hurry over to watch her
fate through a grate.
Threepio cringes and glances wistfully at the carbonite form of Han
Solo, but is immediately distracted by a gunshot offscreen. An
unnatural quiet sweeps the boisterous gathering. On the far side of the
room, the crush of debauchers moves aside to allow the approach of two
guards followed by BOUSHH, an oddly cloaked bounty hunter, leading his
captive, Han Solo's copilot, CHEWBACCA THE WOOKIEE.
Bib takes his place next to his disgusting master, and whispers into
his ear, pointing at Chewbacca and the bounty hunter. Jabba listens
intently, then the bounty hunter bows before the gangster and speaks a
greeting in a strange, electronically processed tongue (Ubese).
BOUSHH	 (in Ubese subtitled)
I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.
THREEPIO
Oh, no! Chewbacca!
JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.
Jabba lets out a loud, long, blood-curdling laugh and turns to
Threepio, waving him closer. The reluctant droid obeys.
THREEPIO
Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!
Jabba continues speaking, as Threepio nervously translates. Boushh
listens, studying the dangerous creatures around the room. He notices
BOBA FETT standing near the door.
THREEPIO
Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the
reward of twenty-five thousand.
BOUSHH	 (in Ubese subtitled)
I want fifty thousand. No less.
Jabba immediately flies into a rage, knocking the golden droid off the
raised throne into a clattering heap on the floor. Boushh adjusts his
weapon as Jabba raves in Huttese and Threepio struggles back onto the
throne. The disheveled droid tries to compose himself.
THREEPIO
Uh, oh... but what, what did I say?
(to Boushh)
Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.
The bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand. Threepio
looks at it, then looks at Jabba, then back to the bounty hunter. The
droid is very nervous and Jabba is getting very impatient.
THREEPIO
Because he's holding a thermal detonator.
The guards instantly back away, as do most of the other monsters in the
room. Jabba stares at the silver ball, which begins to glow in the
bounty hunter's hand. The room has fallen into a tense hush. Jabba
stares at the bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across
his vast mouth and he begins to laugh.
JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.
Jabba continues.
THREEPIO
Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.
Bib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for his
reaction. Boushh releases a switch on the thermal detonator and it goes
dead.
BOUSHH
Zeebuss.
THREEPIO
He agrees!
The raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and
applause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch. Chewbacca
growls. As he is led away we spot LANDO CALRISSIAN, disguised as a
skiff guard in a partial face mask. The band starts up and dancing
girls take the center of the floor, to the hoots of the loudly
appreciative creatures.
Boushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys the
scene, his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare from across
the room. Boba Fett is watching him. Boushh shifts slightly, cradling
his weapon lovingly. Boba Fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance.
12   INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR AND CELL
Gamorrean guards lead Chewie down the same hallway we saw before. When
a tentacle reaches out at the Wookiee, Chewie's ferocious ROAR echoes
against the walls and the tentacle snaps back into its cell in terror.
It takes all the guards to hurl Chewie roughly into a cell, slamming
the door behind him. Chewie lets out a pathetic howl and bangs on the
iron door.
13   EXT JABBA'S PALACE
The palace is sitting in the light of the double sunset. On the road in
front, a large toadlike creature flicks its tongue out for a desert
rodent and burps in satisfaction.
14   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM - NIGHT
Silence. The room is deserted, only the awful debris of the alien
celebration giving mute witness to the activity here before. Several
drunk creatures lie unconscious around the room, snoring loudly.
A shadowy figure moves stealthily among the columns at the perimeter of
the room and is revealed to be Boushh, the bounty hunter. He picks his
way carefully through the snoring, drunken monsters.
Han Solo, the frozen space pirate, hangs spotlighted on the wall, his
coffin-like case suspended by a force field. The bounty hunter
deactivates the force field by flipping a control switch to one side of
the coffin. The heavy case slowly lowers to the floor of the alcove.
Boushh steps up to the case, studying Han, and then turns to the
controls on the side of the coffin. He activates a series of switches
and, after one last hesitant look at Han, slides the de-carbonization
lever. The case begins to emit a sound as the hard shell covering the
contours of Han's face begins to melt away. The bounty hunter watches
as Han's body is freed of its metallic coat and his forearms and hands,
previously raised in reflexive protest, drop slackly to his side. His
face muscles relax from their mask of horror. He appears quite dead.
Boushh's ugly helmet leans close to Han's face listening for the breath
of life. Nothing. He waits. Han's eyes pop open with a start and he
begins coughing. The bounty hunter steadies the staggering newborn.
BOUSHH
Just relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite.
Han touches his face with his hand and moans.
BOUSHH
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
HAN
I can't see.
BOUSHH
Your eyesight will return in time.
HAN
Where am I?
BOUSHH
Jabba's palace.
HAN
Who are you?
The bounty hunter reaches up and lifts the helmet from his head,
revealing the beautiful face of PRINCESS LEIA.
LEIA
Someone who loves you.
HAN
Leia!
LEIA
I gotta get you out of here.
As Leia helps her weakened lover to stand up, the relative quiet is
pierced by an obscene HUTTESE CACKLE from the other side of the alcove.
HAN
What's that? I know that laugh.
The curtain on the far side of the alcove opens, revealing Jabba the
Hutt, surrounded by Bib and other aliens. He laughs again, and his
gross cronies join in a cacophony of alien glee.
HAN
Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I
got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.
Jabba laughs.
JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but
now you're Bantha fodder.
HAN
Look...
JABBA	 (cont Huttese subtitled)
Take him away!
The guards grab Han and start to lead him away.
HAN
Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here.
Don't be a fool!
Han is dragged off, as Lando quickly moves forward and attempts to lead
Leia away.
JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Bring her to me.
Jabba chuckles as Lando and a second guard drag the beautiful young
princess toward him. Threepio peeks from behind a monster and quickly
turns away in disgust.
LEIA
We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...
JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
I'm sure.
Inexorably her lovely face moves to within a few inches of Jabba's ugly
blob of a head, and Leia turns away in disgust.
LEIA
Ugh!
THREEPIO
Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.
15   INT DUNGEON CELL
The heavy metal door of the dungeon whines and slowly creaks open. A
guard throws the blinded star captain into the dark cell and the door
slams shut behind him, leaving only a thin sliver of light from a crack
in the door. Han is trying to collect himself when suddenly a growl is
heard from the far side of the cell. He jumps back against the cell
door and listens.
HAN
Chewie? Chewie, is that you?
The shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward Han, lifting
him off the ground with a big hug that carries them into the light,
revealing Chewie.
HAN
Ah! Chew--Chewie!
The giant Wookiee barks with glee.
HAN
Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?
Chewie barks an excited blue streak.
HAN
Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less
rescue anybody.
Chewie barks a reply.
HAN
A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets
delusions of grandeur.
Chewie growls insistently. He holds Han to his chest and pets his head.
HAN
I'm all right, pal. I'm all right.
16   INT MAIN GATE AND HALL - JABBA'S PALACE
Noisily, the main gate lifts to flood the blackness with blinding LIGHT
and reveal the silhouetted figure of LUKE SKYWALKER. He is clad in a
robe similar to Ben's and wears neither pistol nor laser sword. Luke
strides purposefully into the hallway. Two giant guards move to block
Luke's path. Luke halts.
Luke raises his hand and points at the puzzled guards, who immediately
lower their spears and fall back. The young Jedi lowers his hand and
moves on down the hallway.
Bib Fortuna appears out of the gloom. He speaks to Luke as they
approach each other, but Luke doesn't stop and Bib must reverse his
direction and hurry alongside the young Jedi in order to carry on the
conversation. Several other guards fall in behind them in the darkness.
LUKE
I must speak with Jabba.
Bib answers in Huttese, shaking his head in denial. Luke stops and
stares at Bib; he raises his hand slightly.
LUKE
You will take me to Jabba now!
Bib turns in hypnotic response to Luke's command, and Luke follows him
into the gloom.
LUKE
You serve your master well.
Bib responds.
LUKE
And you will be rewarded.
17   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM
Jabba is asleep on his throne, with Leia lying in front of him.
Salacious sits by Jabba's tail, watching it wriggle. Leia is now
dressed in the skimpy costume of a dancing girl; a chain runs from a
manacle/necklace at her throat to her new master, Jabba the Hutt.
Threepio stands behind Jabba as Bib comes up to the gangster slug.
THREEPIO
At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.
BIB
Master.
Jabba awakens with a start and Bib continues, in Huttese.
BIB
...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.
JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
I told you not to admit him.
LUKE
I must be allowed to speak.
BIB	 (in Huttese subtitled)
He must be allowed to speak.
Jabba, furious, clobbers Bib and shoves him away.
JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.
Luke stares hard at Jabba.
LUKE
You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me.
JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.
LUKE
Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either
profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not
to underestimate my powers.
Jabba's laugh is mean and loud. Threepio attempts to warn Luke about
the pit.
THREEPIO
Master Luke, you're standing on...
JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die.
Luke reaches out, and a pistol jumps out of a guard's holster and flies
into Luke's hand. The bewildered guard grabs for it as Jabba raises his
hand.
JABBA
Bascka!
The floor suddenly drops away, sending Luke and the hapless guard into
the pit. The pistol goes off, blasting a hole in the ceiling. Jabba
laughs and his courtiers join in. Leia starts forward but is restrained
by a human guard-- Lando, recognizable behind his mask. She looks at
him and he shakes his head ""no.""
18   INT RANCOR PIT
Luke and the guard have dropped twenty-five feet from a chute into the
dungeonlike cage. Luke gets to his feet as the guard yells hysterically
for help. A crowd gathers up around the edge of the pit as the door in
the side of the pit starts to RUMBLE open. The guard screams in panic.
Luke looks calmly around for a means of escape.
THREEPIO
Oh, no! The Rancor!
At the side of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a giant, fanged
RANCOR emerges. The guard runs to the side of the pit and tries
futilely to scramble to the top. The hideous beast closes in on him.
The Rancor moves past Luke, and as the guard continues to scramble, the
Rancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering jaws. A few
screams, and the guard is swallowed with a gulp. The audience cheers
and laughs at the guard's fate.
The monster turns and starts for Luke. The young Jedi dashes away just
ahead of the monster's swipe at him, and picks up the long arm bone of
an earlier victim. The monster grabs Luke and brings him up to his
salivating mouth. At the last moment, Luke wedges the bone in the
monster's mouth and is dropped to the floor. The monster bellows in
rage and flails about, hitting the side of the pit, causing an
avalanche.
The monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees Luke, who squeezes
into a crevice in the pit wall. Luke looks past the monster to the
holding cave beyond. On the far side of the holding cave is a utility
door--if only he can get to it. The Rancor spots Luke and reaches into
the crevice for him. Luke grabs a large rock and raises it, smashing it
down on the Rancor's finger.
19   HOLDING TUNNEL - RANCOR PIT
The Rancor lets out a loud howl as Luke makes a run for the holding
cave. He reaches the door and pushes a button to open it. When he
succeeds, he sees a heavy barred gate between him and safety. Beyond
the gate two guards look up from their dinner. Luke turns to see the
monster heading for him, and pulls with all his might on the gate. The
guards move to the gate and start poking at the young Jedi with spears,
laughing.
Luke crouches (against the wall) as the monster starts to reach for
him. Suddenly he notices a main door control panel halfway up the wall.
As the Rancor moves in for the kill, Luke picks up a skull from the
cave floor and hurls it at the panel. The giant overhead door comes
crashing down on the beast's head, squashing it like a sledgehammer on
an egg.
A startled gasp is heard from the stunned court. There's consternation
at this turn of events. Heads look to Jabba, who is actually turning
red with anger. Leia cannot suppress her joy. Jabba utters harsh
commands to his guards and they hurry off.
JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage.
21   INT RANCOR PIT
The Rancor KEEPERS have come into the cage and are examining their dead
beast. One of them breaks down and weeps. The other glares menacingly
at Luke, who is unworried. Several guards rush into the holding tunnel
and take Luke away.
22   INT THRONE ROOM
The crowd of creepy courtiers parts as Han and Chewie are brought into
the throne room, and other guards drag Luke up the steps.
LUKE
Han!
HAN
Luke!
LUKE
Are you all right?
HAN
Fine. Together again, huh?
LUKE
Wouldn't miss it.
HAN
How are we doing?
LUKE
The same as always.
HAN
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
Luke looks to Leia.
LEIA
I'm here.
Threepio is standing behind the grotesque gangster as he strokes Leia
like a pet cat. Several of the guards, including Lando, bring Luke from
the other side of the room. Boba is standing behind Jabba.
Threepio steps forward and translates for the captives.
THREEPIO
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the Hutt, has decreed
that you are to be terminated immediately.
HAN
Good, I hate long waits.
THREEPIO
You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea and cast into the pit of
Carkoon, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.
HAN	 (to Luke)
Doesn't sound so bad.
THREEPIO
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as
you are slowly digested over a thousand years.
HAN
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?
Chewie barks his agreement.
LUKE
You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever
make.
Jabba cackles evilly at this.
As the guards drag the prisoners from the throne room, a loud cheer
rises from the crowd. Leia and Chewie exchange concerned looks, but
Luke Skywalker, Jedi warrior, cannot suppress a smile.
23   EXT TATOOINE SEA - SKIFF
Jabba's huge SAIL BARGE moves above the desert surface accompanied by
two smaller Skiffs. One of the skiffs glides close, revealing Luke,
Han, and Chewie -- all in bonds -- surrounded by guards, one of whom is
Lando in disguise.
HAN
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a
big light blur.
LUKE
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.
HAN
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
LUKE
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
HAN
Oh... great!
24   INT BARGE OBSERVATION DECK
Jabba the Hutt rides like a sultan in the massive antigravity ship. His
entire retinue is with him, drinking, eating, and having a good time.
Leia is watching her friends in the skiff when the chain attached to
her neck is pulled tight and Jabba tugs the scantily clad princess to
him.
JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.
Threepio wanders among the Sail Barge aliens, bumping into a smaller
droid serving drinks, spilling them all over the place. The stubby
droid lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles.
THREEPIO
Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here?
Artoo beeps a quick reply.
THREEPIO
Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous.
They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!
Artoo whistles a singsong response.
THREEPIO
Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.
25   EXT SARLACC PIT
The convoy moves up over a huge sand pit. The Sail Barge stops to one
side of the depression, as does the escort skiff. But the prisoner's
skiff moves out directly over the center and hovers. At the bottom of
the deep cone of sand is a repulsive, mucous-lined hole, surrounded by
thousands of needle-sharp teeth. This is the SARLACC. A plank is
extended from the edge of the prisoner's skiff. Guards release Luke's
bonds and shove him out onto the plank above the Sarlacc's mouth.
26   EXT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK
Jabba and Leia are now by the rail, watching. Threepio leans forward
and the slobbering villain mumbles something to him. As Threepio steps
up to a comlink, Jabba raises his arm and the motley array of
intergalactic pirates fall silent. Threepio's voice is amplified across
loudspeakers.
THREEPIO
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die
honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba
the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.
27   EXT SKIFF
Han steps forward arrogantly and begins to speak.
HAN
Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get
no such pleasure from us. Right?
Chewie growls his agreement.
LUKE
Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.
Lando moves unobtrusively along the skiff as Luke shoots a quick look
of conspiracy to him.
28   INT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK
The assembled monsters rock with mocking laughter as Artoo zips
unnoticed up the ramp to the upper deck. Jabba's laughter subsides as
he speaks into the comlink.
JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Move him into position.
Jabba makes a thumbs-down gesture. Leia looks worried.
29   EXT BARGE - UPPER DECK
Artoo appears from below and zips over to the rail facing the pit.
Below, in the skiff, Luke is prodded by a guard to the edge of the
plank over the gaping Sarlacc. Luke looks up at Artoo, then gives a
jaunty salute: the signal the little droid has been waiting for. A flap
opens in Artoo's domed head.
JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled)
Put him in.
30   EXT SKIFF - PLANK
Luke is prodded and jumps off the plank to the cheers of the
bloodthirsty spectators. But, before anyone can even perceive what is
happening, he spins around and grabs the end of the plank by his
fingertips. The plank bends wildly from his weight and catapults him
skyward. In midair he does a complete flip and drops down on the end of
the plank in the same spot he just vacated, but facing the skiff. He
casually extends an open palm and -- his lightsaber, which Artoo has
sent arcing toward him, drops into his hand.
With samurai speed, Luke ignites it and attacks the guard who prodded
him off the plank, sending the hapless monster screaming overboard. The
other guards swarm toward Luke. He wades into them, lightsaber
flashing. Lando struggles with another guard at the back of the skiff.
31   EXT SARLACC PIT
A bewildered guard lands in the soft, sandy slope of the pit, and
begins sliding. He claws desperately as a Sarlacc tentacle grabs him
and pulls him screaming into the viscous mouth.
32   INT SAIL BARGE
Jabba watches this and explodes in rage. He barks commands, and the
guards around him rush off to do his bidding. The scuzzy creatures
watching the action from the window are in an uproar.
33   EXT SKIFF
Luke knocks another guard off the skiff and into the waiting mouth of
the Sarlacc. He starts to untie Chewie's bonds.
LUKE
Easy, Chewie.
At that moment, the deck gunmen on the barge unleash a series of blasts
from a big cannon on the upper deck. Lando is tossed from the deck of
the rocking skiff. He manages to grab a rope, and dangles desperately
above the Sarlacc pit.
LANDO
Whoa! Whoa! Help!
34   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE
With two swift strides, the dangerous Boba Fett ignites his rocket
pack, leaps into the air, and flies from the barge down to the skiff.
35   EXT SKIFF
Boba lands on the skiff and starts to aim his laser gun at Luke, who
has freed Han and Chewie from their bonds. But before Boba can fire,
the young Jedi spins on him, lightsaber sweeping, and hacks the bounty
hunter's gun in half.
Immediately, the skiff takes another direct hit from the barge's deck
gun. Shards of skiff deck fly. Chewie and Han are thrown against the
rail.
HAN
Chewie, you okay? Where is he?
The Wookiee is wounded and he howls in pain.
HAN
I'm okay, pal.
For a moment, Luke is distracted, and in that moment, Boba fires a
cable out of his armored sleeve. Instantly, Luke is wrapped in a strong
cable, his arms pinned against his side, his sword arm free only from
the wrist down.  Luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber points straight
up to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke shrugs away the cable
and stands free.
Another blast from the Barge's deck gun hits near Boba and he is
knocked unconscious to the deck, next to where Lando is hanging.
LANDO
Han! Chewie?
HAN
Lando!
Luke is a little shaken but remains standing as a fusillade brackets
him. The second skiff, loaded with guards firing their weapons, moves
in on Luke fast. Luke leaps toward the incoming second skiff. The young
Jedi leaps into the middle of the second skiff and begins decimating
the guards from their midst.
Chewie, wounded, tries to lift himself as he barks directions to Han,
guiding him toward a spear which has been dropped by one of the guards.
Han searches the deck as Chewie barks directions; finally he grabs hold
of the spear.
Boba Fett, badly shaken, rises from the deck. He looks over at the
other skiff, where Luke is whipping a mass of guards. Boba raises his
arm, and aims his lethal appendage.
Chewie barks desperately at Han.
HAN
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?
The space pirate turns around blindly, and the long spear in his hand
whacks squarely in the middle of Boba's rocket pack.
The impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite. Boba blasts
off, flying over the second skiff like a missile, smashing against the
side of the huge Sail Barge and sliding away into the pit. He screams
as his armored body makes its last flight past Lando and directly into
the mucous mouth of the Sarlacc. The Sarlacc burps. Chewie growls a
weak congratulations to Han.
36   INT SAIL BARGE
Leia turns from the spectacle outside, leaps onto Jabba's throne, and
throws the chain that enslaves her over his head around his bulbous
neck. Then she dives off the other side of the throne, pulling the
chain violently in her grasp. Jabba's flaccid neck contracts beneath
the tightening chain. His huge eyes bulge from their sockets and his
scum-coated tongue flops out. The Exalted Hutt's huge tail spasms
through its death throes and then slams down into final stillness. Leia
struggles to free herself of her bondage.
37   EXT SKIFF
Luke continues to destroy the aliens on the guards' skiff, as Han
extends his spear downward to Lando, who is still dangling precariously
from a rope on the prisoner's skiff.
HAN
Lando, grab it!
LANDO
Lower it!
HAN
I'm trying!
A major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side. Han
and almost everything else on board slides overboard. The rope breaks,
and Lando falls to the side of the Sarlacc pit. Luckily, Han's foot
catches on the skiff railing and he dangles above Lando and the pit.
The wounded Wookiee holds onto the skiff for dear life as another hit
from the deck gun rocks the skiff violently.
HAN
Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.
Chewie grabs hold of Han's feet, holding him upside down, as Han
extends the spear toward Lando, who is clutching to the side of the
pit.
HAN
Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!
Luke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff. He sees the deck
gun blasting away at his helpless companions. Luke leaps from the
skiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side of the Sail
Barge. Barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up
the hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his
head. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks
the helpless guard through the broken window and into the deadly pit.
The injured Chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling Han, who
is in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate Lando. The Baron
has stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of the Sarlacc pit by
lying very still. Every time he tries to reach for Han, the loose sand
moves him closer to his final reward.
HAN
Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!
Another blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing Lando to let
go of the spear.
LANDO
Hold it! Whoa!
Again Han extends the spear toward Lando.
HAN
Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie.
Lando screams. One of the Sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly
around his ankle, dragging him down the side of the pit.
HAN
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
LANDO
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
HAN
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
LANDO
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
Han adjusts his aim as Lando lowers his head, and the fuzzy-eyed pirate
fires at the tentacle. Direct hit. The tentacle releases Lando, and
Chewie starts to pull them on board the skiff.
HAN
Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!
38   EXT UPPER DECK
The deck gunners have Chewie and the desperate dangling human chain in
their gun sights when something up on deck commands their attention:
Luke, standing before them like a pirate king, ignites his lightsaber.
The deck gunners have barely reached for their pistols before the young
Jedi has demolished them. Immediately, Luke turns to see two more
gunners (who have been uncovering a giant gun at the end of the barge)
racing for him, firing their laser pistols.
39   INT SAIL BARGE - OBSERVATION DECK
Leia is struggling against her chains in desperation as Artoo zips
through the tumult of confused monsters to the rescue; the stubby
little droid extends a small laser gun and blasts the chain apart.
LEIA
Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.
Artoo and Leia race for the exit, passing Threepio, who is kicking and
screaming as Salacious Crumb, the reptilian monkey- monster picks out
one of the golden droid's eyes.
THREEPIO
Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!
Artoo zips over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a scream,
crashing into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Threepio (with his eye
dangling from a wire) hurry off.
40   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE
Luke is warding off laser blasts with his lightsaber, surrounded by
guards and fighting like a demon. Leia emerges onto the deck as Luke
turns to face another guard.
LUKE	 (to Leia)
Get the gun! Point it at the deck!
Leia turns toward the barge cannon, climbs on the platform, and swivels
the gun around.
LUKE
Point it at the deck!
A laser blast hits Luke's mechanical hand and he bends over in pain,
but manages to swing his lightsaber upward and take out the last of the
guards. He looks at the wounded hand, which reveals the mechanism. He
flexes the hand; it still works.
Near the rail of the upper deck, Artoo and Threepio steady themselves
as Threepio gets ready to jump. Artoo beeps wildly.
THREEPIO
Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.
Artoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself,
tumbling toward the sand.
Luke runs along the empty deck toward Leia and the barge gun, which she
has brought around to point down at the deck.
LUKE
Come on!
Luke has hold on one of the rigging ropes from the mast. He gathers
Leia in his other arm and kicks the trigger of the deck gun. The gun
explodes into the deck as Luke and Leia swing out toward the skiff.
41   EXT SKIFF
Han leans panting against the rail as Chewie helps Lando onto the deck.
Luke and Leia land on the skiff with flair.
LUKE
Let's go! And don't forget the droids.
LANDO
We're on our way.
The Sail Barge is exploding in stages in the distance. Half of the huge
craft is on fire.
42   EXT SAND DUNE
Threepio's legs stick straight up from the dune where he landed. Next
to it, Artoo's periscope is the only thing above the sand. The skiff
floats above them and two large electromagnets dangle down on a wire.
With a loud CLANG, both droids are pulled
from the sand.
43   EXT DUNE SEA
The little skiff skips around the burning Sail Barge, which continues
its chain of explosions. As the skiff sails off across the desert, the
barge settles to the sand and disappears in one final conflagration.
44   EXT DUNE SEA - LANDING AREA
A ferocious sandstorm blocks our view. Then, through the ROAR, we HEAR
THE VOICES of our heroes. They emerge slowly from the veil of sand,
pressing on against the wind. First come Artoo and Threepio, followed
by Leia guiding Han, then Luke and Lando come into view, each
supporting one side of the towering Chewbacca, who hobbles from his
wound.
Soon, they can make out some large vague shapes in the blowing sand. It
is the Millennium Falcon and, parked beside it, Luke's trusty X-wing
and a two-seated Y-wing. They must shout to be heard.
HAN
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!
LEIA
That's all any of us can see.
HAN	 (blinking)
Then I guess I'm getting better.
As soon as the group huddles under the bulk of the Falcon, the wind
dies down to something more describable as a severe weather condition.
Threepio hits a switch, and the gang-plank lowers with a HUM.
HAN 	(turning to Luke)
I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.
LUKE	 (shrugging it off)
I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.
HAN
No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest
thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide
awake nothing!
Luke nods, as Chewie growls affectionately at the young Jedi warrior,
mussing his hair like a proud uncle. And Leia warmly hugs him.
LUKE 	(moving to his ship)
I'll see you back at the fleet.
HAN
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
LUKE
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Luke and Artoo take off in their spacecraft.
HAN
(looking dubiously at Lando, obviously remembering his friend's
betrayal and subsequent aide)
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
LANDO
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the
rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
LEIA
He means ""You're welcome.""
LANDO
Come on, let's get off this miserable dust ball.
44A  EXT SPACE ABOVE TATOOINE
The desolate yellow planet fills the screen, Luke's X-wing appears and
peels off to the left. A moment later, the FALCON appears as a dot and
grows huge, to roar directly over the CAMERA.
45   INT X-WING - COCKPIT
Luke is at the controls, with Artoo attached behind him outside the
canopy. Luke speaks into his comlink to the others, in the MILLENNIUM
FALCON.
LUKE
I'll meet you back at the fleet.
LEIA	 (over comlink)
Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now.
LUKE
I will.
HAN	 (over comlink)
Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.
A message from Artoo appears on the small monitor screen in front of
Luke. He smiles at the monitor and speaks to Artoo, as he pulls a black
glove on to cover his wounded mechanical hand.
LUKE
That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a
promise to keep... to an old friend.
46   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR AND ENDOR
A Super Star Destroyer and several ships of the Imperial Fleet rest in
space above the half-completed Death Star and its green neighbor,
Endor. Four squads of TIE fighters escort an Imperial shuttle toward
the Death Star.
47   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO DOCKING BAY
Lord Vader strides down the hallway, accompanied by a very nervous
Death Star commander.
48   INT DOCKING BAY - DEATH STAR
Thousands of Imperial troops in tight formation fill the mammoth
docking bay. Vader and the officer walk to the landing platform, where
the shuttle is coming to rest.
The shuttle's ramp lowers and the Emperor's Royal Guards come out and
create a lethal perimeter. The assembled troops move to rigid attention
with a momentous SNAP.
Then, in the huge SILENCE which follows, the EMPEROR appears. He is a
rather small, shriveled old man. His bent frame slowly makes its way
down the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane. He wears a hooded cloak
similar to the one Ben wears, except that it is black. The Emperor's
face is shrouded and difficult to see, except for his piercing yellow
eyes. Commander Jerjerrod and Darth Vader kneel to him. The Supreme
Ruler of the galaxy beckons to the Dark Lord.
EMPEROR	 (to Vader)
Rise, my friend.
Vader rises and falls in next to the Emperor as he slowly makes his way
along the rows of troops. Jerjerrod and the other commanders stay
kneeling until the Supreme Ruler and Vader, followed by several
Imperial dignitaries, pass by; only then do they join in the
procession.
VADER
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
EMPEROR
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue
your search for young Skywalker.
VADER
Yes, my Master.
EMPEROR
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does,
you must bring him
before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the
dark side of the
Force.
VADER
As you wish.
EMPEROR
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.
He laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of Imperial
troops.
49   EXT YODA'S HOUSE - DAGOBAH
Once again, Artoo finds himself waiting around in the damp environs of
the swamp planet, and he's none too happy about it. He beeps
disconsolately to himself and turns to look at Yoda's cottage. Warm
yellow light escapes the oddly shaped windows to fight the gloom.
50   INT YODA'S HOUSE
The tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen floor of
the cottage. Our view travels up the stick to the small green hand that
clutches it, and then to the familiar face of YODA, THE JEDI MASTER.
His manner is frail, and his voice, though cheerful, seems weaker.
YODA
Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?
Luke is sitting in a corner of the cramped space and, indeed, his look
has been woeful. Caught, he tries to hide it.
LUKE
No... of course not.
YODA	 (tickled, chuckles)
I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak.
(Points a crooked finger)
When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?
Yoda chuckles at this, coughs, and hobbles over toward his bed.
YODA
Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.
Yoda sits himself on his bed, with great effort.
LUKE
Master Yoda, you can't die.
YODA
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me
and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the
Force.
LUKE
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
YODA
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Yoda sighs, and lies back on his bed.
LUKE
Then I am a Jedi?
YODA	 (shakes his head)
Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then,
only then, a Jedi will you be. And confront him you will.
Luke is in agony. He is silent for a long moment, screwing up his
courage. Finally he is able to ask.
LUKE
Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?
Yoda's eyes are full of weariness and compassion. An odd, sad smile
creases his face. He turns painfully on his side, away from Luke.
YODA
Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.
Luke watches him, each moment an eternity.
LUKE
Yoda, I must know.
YODA
Your father he is.
Luke reacts as if cut.
YODA
Told you, did he?
LUKE
Yes.
A new look of concern crosses Yoda's face.  He closes his eyes.
YODA
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
LUKE
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
Yoda opens his eyes again and studies the youth.
YODA		 (gathering all his strength)
No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your
training. Not
ready for the burden were you.
LUKE
Well, I'm sorry.
YODA
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger,
fear, aggression.
The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever
will it dominate your
destiny.
He beckons the young Jedi closer to him.
YODA
Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor,
or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I
(cough),
the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your
family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke...
(with great effort)
There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.
He catches his breath. A shiver runs through the ancient green
creature, and he dies. Luke stares at his dead master as he disappears
in front of his eyes.
51   EXT DAGOBAH SWAMP - X-WING
Luke wanders back to where his ship is sitting. Artoo beeps a greeting,
but is ignored by his depressed master. Luke kneels down, begins to
help Artoo with the ship, then stops and shakes his head dejectedly.
LUKE
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
BEN	 (OS)
Yoda will always be with you.
Luke looks up to see the shimmering image of BEN KENOBI.
LUKE
Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?
The ghost of Ben Kenobi approaches him through the swamp.
LUKE
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.
BEN
You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be
Anakin Skywalker
and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your
father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a
certain point of view.
LUKE	 (turning away, derisive)
A certain point of view!
BEN
Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend
greatly on our own
point of view.
Luke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in silence for a moment.
BEN
I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it
certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened
to your father was my fault.
Ben pauses sadly.
BEN
Anakin was a good friend.
Luke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on a
stump, mesmerized. Artoo comes over to offer his comforting presence.
BEN
When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was
amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to
train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well
as Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the
galaxy.
Luke is entranced.
LUKE
There's still good in him.
BEN
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be
done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.
LUKE
I can't do it, Ben.
BEN
You cannot escape your destiny.
LUKE
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.
BEN
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience
was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value
of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you
could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been
prepared.
LUKE
But I had to help my friends.
BEN	 (grinning at Luke's indignation)
And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved
little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.
LUKE	 (with sadness)
I found out Darth Vader was my father.
BEN
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side
- the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest
door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what
he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're
no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now,
you must face Darth Vader again!
LUKE
I can't kill my own father.
BEN
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
LUKE
Yoda spoke of another.
BEN
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.
LUKE
But I have no sister.
BEN
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your
father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were
to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the
reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.
LUKE
Leia! Leia's my sister.
BEN
Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They
do you credit.
But they could be made to serve the Emperor.
Luke looks into the distance, trying to comprehend all this.
BEN	 (continuing his narrative)
When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your
mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep
you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you
to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia
to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on Alderaan.
Luke turns, and settles near Ben to hear the tale.
BEN	 (attempting to give solace with his words)
The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in
that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew
she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power,
since Alderaan had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family
continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster
father's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of
course... she became the leader of her cell in the Alliance against the
corrupt Empire. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a
vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she
was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had
always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became
desperate.
Luke is overwhelmed by the truth, and is suddenly protective of his
sister.
LUKE
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
BEN
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have,
Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your
family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy
Vader!
52   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET
The vast Rebel Fleet stretches as far as the eye can see. Overhead a
dozen small Corellian battleships fly in formation. Fighters and
battlecruisers surround the largest of the Rebel Star Cruisers, the
HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE.
53   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN BRIEFING ROOM
Hundreds of Rebel commanders of all races and forms are assembled in
the WAR ROOM. WEDGE is among them. In the center of the room is a
holographic model depicting the half-completed Imperial Death Star, the
nearby Moon of Endor, and the protecting deflector shield.
MON MOTHMA, the leader of the Alliance, enters the room. She is a stern
but beautiful woman in her fifties. Conferring with her are several
military leaders, including GENERAL MADINE and ADMIRAL ACKBAR (a
salmon-colored Mon Calamari). Lando moves through the crowd until he
finds Han and Chewie, standing next to Leia and the two droids.
Han peers at Lando's new insignia on his chest, and is amused.
HAN
Well, look at you, a general, huh?"|stage direction
2|"battle of Taanab.
HAN	 (sarcastic)
Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I
didn't know they were
lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.
LANDO	 (smiling)
I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.
HAN
Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable
one, remember?
Mon Mothma signals for attention, and the room falls silent.
MON MOTHMA
The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has
come.
This causes a stir. Mon Mothma turns to a holographic model of the
Death Star, the Endor moon and the protecting deflector shield in the
center of the room.
MON MOTHMA
The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact location
of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon
systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the Imperial
Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is
relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that
the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the
construction of this Death Star.
A volley of spirited chatter erupts from the crowd. Han turns to Leia
as Chewie barks his amazement.
MON MOTHMA	 (cont)
Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.
Admiral Ackbar steps forward and points to the Death Star's force field
and the Moon of Endor.
ACKBAR
You can see here the Death Star orbiting the forest Moon of Endor.
Although the weapon
systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, the Death Star does
have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield,
which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield
must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield
is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly
into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.
There's a concerned murmur.
ACKBAR	 (cont)
General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack
Han turns to Lando with a look of respect.
HAN
Good luck.
Lando nods his thanks.
HAN
You're gonna need it.
ACKBAR
General Madine.
Madine moves center stage.
GENERAL MADINE
We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and
using a secret
Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the
shield generator.
The assembly begins to mumble among themselves.
THREEPIO
Sounds dangerous.
LEIA	 (to Han)
I wonder who they found to pull that off.
GENERAL MADINE
General Solo, is your strike team assembled?
Leia, startled, looks up at Han, surprise changing to admiration.
HAN
Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle.
Chewbacca raises his hairy paw and volunteers.  Han looks up at him.
HAN
Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you.
Chewie waves that off with a huge GROWL.
HAN	 (smiles)
That's one.
LEIA
Uh, General... count me in.
VOICE	 (OS)
I'm with you, too!
They turn in that direction and peer into the crowd as there are more
cheers. The commanders part, and there at the back stands Luke. Han and
Leia are surprised and delighted.
Leia moves to Luke and embraces him warmly. She senses a change in him
and looks into his eyes questioningly.

Ask me again sometime.
Han, Chewie, and Lando crowd around Luke as the assembly breaks up.

54   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN DOCKING BAY
The Millennium Falcon rests beyond the stolen IMPERIAL SHUTTLE, which
looks anomalous among all the Rebel ships in the vast docking bay.
Chewie barks a final farewell to Lando and leads Artoo and Threepio up
the shuttle, crowded now with the Rebel strike team loading weapons and
supplies. Lando turns to face Han. Luke and Leia have said their good-
byes and start up the ramp.
HAN
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the
help you can get. She's
the fastest ship in the fleet.
LANDO
All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take
good care of her.
She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
HAN	 (looks at him warmly)
Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.
LANDO
Look, would you get going, you pirate.
Han and Lando pause, then exchange salutes.
LANDO
Good luck.
HAN
You, too.
Han goes up the ramp. Lando watches him go and then slowly turns away.
55   INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT
Luke is working on a back control panel as Han comes in and takes the
pilot's seat. Chewie, in the seat next to him, is trying to figure out
all the Imperial controls.
HAN
You got her warmed?
LUKE
Yeah, she's comin' up.
Chewie growls a complaint.
HAN
No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in mind when they designed
her, Chewie.
Leia comes in from the hold and takes her seat near Luke.
Chewie barks and hits some switches. Han's glance has stuck on
something out the window: the Millennium Falcon. Leia nudges him
gently.
LEIA
Hey, are you awake?
HAN
Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
Chewie, hearing this, stops his activity and looks longingly out at the
Falcon, too. Leia puts a hand on Han's shoulder.
LEIA	 (softly)
Come on, General, let's move.
Han snaps back to life.
HAN
Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of junk can do. Ready,
everybody?
LUKE
All set.
THREEPIO
Here we go again.
HAN
All right, hang on.
56   EXT SPACE - THE REBEL FLEET
The stolen Imperial shuttle leaves the main docking bay of the
Headquarters Frigate, lowers its wings into flight position, and zooms
off into space.
57   INT EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM
The converted control room is dimly lit, except for a pool of light at
the far end. There the Emperor sits in an elaborate control chair
before a large window which looks out across the half-completed Death
Star to the giant green moon of Endor.
Darth Vader, standing with other members of the Imperial council,
cautiously approaches his master. The ruler's back is to Vader. After
several tense moments, the Emperor's chair rotates around to face him.
VADER
What is thy bidding, my Master?
EMPEROR
Send the fleet to the far side of Endor. There it will stay until
called for.
VADER
What of the reports of the Rebel fleet massing near Sullust?
EMPEROR
It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will be crushed and young
Skywalker will be one of us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go
out to the command ship and await my orders.
VADER
Yes, my Master.
Vader bows, then turns and exits the throne room as the Emperor walks
toward the waiting council members.
58   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR - MOON
There is a great deal of Imperial traffic in the area as construction
proceeds on the Death Star. Transports, TIE fighters, and a few Star
Destroyers move about. Now the huge Super Star Destroyer announces
itself with a low roar and soon fills the frame.
59   INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT
Han looks back at Luke and Leia as Chewie flips several switches.
Through the viewscreen, the Death Star and the huge Super Star
Destroyer can be seen.
HAN
If they don't go for this, we're gonna have to get outta here pretty
quick, Chewie.
Chewie growls his agreement.
CONTROLLER	 (over radio)
We have you on our screen now. Please identify.
HAN
Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield.
CONTROLLER	 (over radio)
Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage.
HAN
Transmission commencing.
Leia and Chewbacca listen tensely as the sound of a high speed
transmission begins.
LEIA
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
HAN
It'll work. It'll work.
Chewie whines nervously. Luke stares at the Huge Super Star Destroyer
that looms ever larger before them.
LUKE
Vader's on that ship.
HAN
Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep
your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep
your distance.
Chewie barks a question.
HAN
I don't know.  Fly casual.
LUKE
I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come.
HAN
It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here.
Chewie barks his worries as the Super Star Destroyer grows larger out
the window.
60   INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE
Lord Vader stands, back to us, staring out a window at the Death Star.
Now, some vibration felt only by him causes him to turn. After a moment
of stillness, he walks down the row of controllers to where ADMIRAL
PIETT is leaning over the tracking screen of the controller we've seen
earlier. Piett straightens at Vader's approach.
VADER
Where is that shuttle going?
PIETT	 (into comlink)
Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination?
PILOT VOICE    (HAN)   (filtered)
Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.
The Bridge Commander looks to Vader for a reaction.
VADER
Do they have a code clearance?
PIETT
It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them.
Vader looks upward, as he senses Luke's presence.
PIETT
Shall I hold them?
VADER
No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.
PIETT	 (surprised)
As you wish, my lord.
(to controller)
Carry on.
Piett nods at controller, who switches on his comlink.
61   INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT
The group waits tensely.
HAN
They're not goin' for it, Chewie.
CONTROLLER	 (filtered)
Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately.
Follow your
present course.
Everyone breaths a sigh of relief. Everyone but Luke, who looks
worried. Chewie barks.
HAN
Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem.
62   EXT SPACE - STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - ENDOR
The stolen Imperial shuttle moves off toward the green Sanctuary Moon.
63   EXT FOREST LANDING SITE - ENDOR
The stolen Imperial shuttle sits in a clearing of the moon's dark,
primeval forest, dwarfed by the ancient towering trees.
On an adjacent hill, the helmeted Rebel contingent makes its way up a
steep trail. Leia and Han are slightly ahead of Chewie and Luke. The
troops of the strike-team squad follow, with Artoo and Threepio
bringing up the rear. Artoo beeps.
Up ahead, Chewie and Leia reach a crest in the hill and drop suddenly
to the ground, signaling the rest of the group to stop. Han and Luke
crawl up to take a look.
THREEPIO
Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.
THEIR POV. Not far below them, two IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering
through bushes in the valley below. Their two ROCKET BIKES are parked
nearby.
LEIA
Shall we try and go around?
HAN
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
Leia motions for the squad to stay put, then she, Han, Luke and Chewie
start quietly down.
64   EXT FOREST CLEARING - CAMPSITE
The four friends make their way to the edge of the clearing not far
from the two Imperial scouts.
HAN
Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here.
LUKE
Quietly, there might be more of them out there.
HAN	 (grins)
Hey... it's me.
Han and Chewie turn and start through the bushes toward the scouts.
Luke and Leia exchange smiles.
Han sneaks up behind one of the scouts, steps on a twig and the scout
whirls, knocking Han into a tree. The scout shouts for his companion.
SCOUT #1
Go for help! Go!
The second scout jumps on his speeder bike and takes off, but Chewie
gets off a shot on his crossbow laser weapon, causing the scout to
crash into a tree. Han and Scout #1 are in a rousing fistfight.
LUKE	 (sarcastic)
Great. Come on.
Luke starts for the scuffle, followed by Leia with her laser pistol
drawn. As they run through the bushes, Leia stops and points to where
two more scouts are sitting on their speeder bikes, with an unoccupied
bike parked nearby.
LEIA
Over there! Two more of them!
LUKE
I see them. Wait, Leia!
But Leia doesn't hear him and races for the remaining speeder bike. She
starts it up and takes off as Luke jumps on the bike behind her.
LUKE	 (pointing to the controls)
Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!
Luke and Leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit, barely
avoiding two huge trees.
HAN
Hey, wait! Ahhh!
He flips the remaining scout to the ground.
65   EXT FOREST - THE BIKE CHASE
The two fleeing Imperial scouts have a good lead as Luke and Leia
pursue through the giant trees at 200 miles an hour, the fire from
their bike's laser cannon hitting harmlessly near the moving targets.
LUKE
Move closer!
Leia guns it, closing the gap, as the two scouts recklessly veer
through a narrow gap in the trees. One of the bikes SCRAPES a tree,
slowing the scout.
LUKE
Get alongside that one!
Leia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scout's bike that their
steering vanes SCRAPE noisily. Luke leaps from his bike to the back of
the scout's, grabs the Imperial warrior around the neck, and flips him
off the bike, into a thick tree trunk. Luke gains control of the bike
and follows Leia, who has pulled ahead. They tear off after the
remaining scout.
LUKE
Get him!
The speeding chase passes TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two swing
into pursuit, chasing Luke and Leia, firing away with their laser
cannon. The two Rebels look behind them just as Luke's bike takes a
glancing hit.
LUKE	 (indicating the one ahead)
Keep on that one! I'll take these two!
With Leia shooting ahead, Luke suddenly slams his steering vanes into
the braking mode. Luke's bike is a blur to the two pursuing scouts as
they zip by him on either side. Luke slams his bike into forward and
starts firing away, having switched places with his pursuers in a
manner of seconds. Luke's aim is good and one scout's bike is blasted
out of control. It explodes against a tree trunk.
The scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts into
turbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his tail.
FAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom
through the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her bike skyward and
rises out of sight.
The scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer. Suddenly, Leia
dives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. The scout's bike takes
a glancing hit.
Leia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him, reaches
down, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout has
blasted her bike, sending it out of control. Leia dives off as her bike
explodes against a tree. The happy scout looks back at the explosion.
But when he turns forward again, he is on a collision course with a
giant fallen tree. He hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a
conflagration.
ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: Luke and the last remaining scout continue
their weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke moves up close. The
scout responds by slamming his bike into Luke's. A fallen tree forms a
bridge across their path. The scout zips under. Luke goes over the top
and crashes his bike down on the scout's. Both riders look ahead - a
wide trunk looms directly in Luke's path, but the scout's bike beside
him makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it. Luke banks with all
his might, leaning almost horizontal over the scout's bike, and is able
to make it by, just clipping the tree. When he straightens, he and the
scout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes and are
moving as one.
Another big tree looms in Luke's path. He reacts instinctively and
dives off his bike. The two bikes come apart a second before Luke's
explodes against a tree. The scout sweeps out and circles back to find
Luke.
Luke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him and
opens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his laser sword and
begins deflecting the bolts. The scout's bike keeps coming and it
appears that in a second it will cut Luke in half. At the last instant,
Luke steps aside and chops off the bike's control vanes with one mighty
slash. The scout's bike begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling,
it rises up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire.
66   EXT SCOUT CAMPSITE - FOREST
Han, Chewie, and the droids, along with the rest of the squad, wait
anxiously in the clearing. Artoo's radar screen sticks out of his domed
head and revolves, scanning the forest. He beeps.
THREEPIO
Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!
Han, Chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons.
Luke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him. He's
too tired to care. He plops himself down on a boulder and looks around.
HAN
Luke! Where's Leia?
LUKE	 (concerned)
What? She didn't come back?
HAN
I thought she was with you.
LUKE
We got separated.
Luke and Han exchange a silent, grim look. Luke gets up wearily.
LUKE
Hey, we better go look for her.
Han nods, and signals to a Rebel officer.
HAN
Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300.
LUKE
Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.
Luke, Chewie, Han, and the droids move off in one direction as the
squad proceeds in another.
THREEPIO
Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do.
They move off into the woods.
THREEPIO	 (to Artoo)
And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!
67   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE
A strange little furry face with huge black eyes comes slowly into
view. The creature is an EWOK, by the name of WICKET. He seems somewhat
puzzled, and prods Leia with a spear. The princess groans; this
frightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her again. Leia sits up
and stares at the three-foot-high Ewok. She tries to figure out where
she is and what has happened. Her clothes are torn; she's bruised and
disheveled.
The Ewok jumps up and grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he holds in a
defensive position. Leia watches him as he circles warily and begins
poking her with the sharp point of the spear.
LEIA
Cut it out!
She stands up, and the Ewok quickly backs away.
LEIA
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Leia looks around at the dense forest, and at the charred remains of
her speeder bike, then sits down, with a sigh, on a fallen log.
LEIA
Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here
is.
She puts her head in her hands to rub away some of the soreness from
her fall. She looks over at the watchful little Ewok and pats the log
beside her.
LEIA
Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down.
Wicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a puppy. Leia
pats the log again.
LEIA
I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.
More growls and squeaks from the little bear creature.
LEIA
All right. You want something to eat?
She takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to him.
Wicket takes a step backward, then cocks his head and moves cautiously
toward Leia, chattering in his squeaky Ewok language.
LEIA
That's right. Come on. Hmmm?
Sniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and sits on the
log beside her. She takes off her helmet, and the little creature jumps
back, startled again. He runs along the log, pointing his spear at her
and chattering a blue streak. Leia holds out the helmet to him.
LEIA
Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery
little thing, aren't you?
Reassured, Wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log, coming
to investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and he begins to
sniff the air. He looks around warily, whispering some Ewokese warning
to Leia.
LEIA
What is it?
Suddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on the log
next to Leia. Leia and Wicket both roll backwards off the log, hiding
behind it. Leia holds her own laser gun ready, while Wicket disappears
underneath the log. Another shot, and still no sight of anyone in the
forest. Then Leia senses something and turns to find a large IMPERIAL
SCOUT standing over her with his weapon pointed at her head. He reaches
out his hand for her weapon.
SCOUT #l
Freeze!  Come on, get up!
She hands the weapon over, as a second scout emerges from the foliage
in front of the log.
SCOUT #1
Go get your ride and take her back to base.
SCOUT #2
Yes, sir.
The second scout starts toward his bike, as Wicket, crouched under the
log, extends his spear and hits the first scout on the leg. The scout
jumps and lets out an exclamation, and looks down at Wicket, puzzled.
Leia grabs a branch and knocks him out. She dives for his laser pistol,
and the second scout, now on his bike, takes off. Leia fires away and
hits the escaping bike, causing it to crash into the first scout's
bike, which flies end over end and explodes. The forest is quiet once
more. Wicket pokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards
Leia with new respect. He mumbles his awe. Leia hurries over, looking
around all the time, and motions the chubby little creature into the
dense foliage.
LEIA
Come on, let's get outta here.
As they move into the foliage, Wicket takes the lead. He shrieks and
tugs at Leia to follow him.
68   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO EMPEROR'S TOWER
Darth Vader walks down the corridor to the Emperor's Tower and private
elevator. The Emperor's private guard steps in Vader's path.
GUARD
Halt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment.
VADER
(raising his gloved hand to the two guards and choking them with the
Force)
The Emperor will see me, now!
GUARD
(repeating Vader's command)
The Emperor will see you, now.
69   INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM
Two red Imperial Guards stand watch at the elevator as the door opens
to reveal Vader. Vader enters the eerie, foreboding throne room. It
appears to be empty. His footsteps echo as he approaches the throne. He
waits, absolutely still. The Emperor sits with his back to the Dark
Lord.
EMPEROR
I told you to remain on the command ship.
VADER
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
EMPEROR	 (no surprise)
Yes, I know.
VADER	 (after a beat)
My son is with them.
EMPEROR	 (very cool)
Are you sure?
VADER
I have felt him, my Master.
EMPEROR
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are
clear, Lord
Vader.
Vader knows what is being asked.
VADER
They are clear, my Master.
EMPEROR
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
VADER	 (skeptical)
He will come to me?
EMPEROR
I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will
come to you and
then you will bring him before me.
VADER	 (bows)
As you wish.
The Dark Lord strides out of the throne room.
70   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE
Han, Luke, Chewie, and the two droids are spread out as they move
through the heavy foliage near the clearing where we last saw Leia.
Luke finds Leia's helmet, picks it up with an expression of concern.
HAN	 (OS)
Luke! Luke!
Luke runs with the helmet to where Han has found the charred wreckage
of a speeder bike in the grass.
THREEPIO
Oh, Master Luke.
LUKE
There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.
He tosses the helmet to Han.
THREEPIO
I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.
