6||"Though mentioned often in the script, the creatures in PITCH BLACK are
seldom seen at length; rather, they are glimpsed, they are heard, they are
felt. They are, really, the embodiment of your nocturnal fears: A howling
coyote that jars you awake; the painting on the wall that comes to life
when stared at too long...the sway of your bed just before the earthquake
hits. Chimera of the night. The point is made so the reader appreciates
that the focus of the finished film will not be on what the creatures do,
but on what the creatures do to reveal the inner nature of the characters.
For PITCH BLACK is, at its heart, a story of humanity and courage -- and
lack of the same."|location
