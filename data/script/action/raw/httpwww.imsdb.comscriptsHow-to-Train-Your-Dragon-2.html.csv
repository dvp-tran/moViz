3||EXT. BERK - DAY|location
4|unknown|"(Sequence 0200 - New Berk)
To the island village of Berk, festively adorned with flags
and banners. Major new additions alter its familiar skyline.
HICCUP (V.O.)
This... is Berk. The best kept
secret this side of, well,
anywhere. Granted, it may not look
like much, but this wet heap of
rock packs more than a few
surprises."|speech
5||"ON A CLUSTER OF SHEEP, hiding nervously between buildings as
shadows of passing dragons race by. The group moves as one,
receding into a shadowy alley, pushing one sheep out into the
light. It's suddenly snatched and carried into the air!"|stage direction
6|unknown|"HICCUP (V.O.)
Life here is amazing, just not for
the faint of heart. See, where most
folks enjoy hobbies like whittling
or needlepoint, we Berkians prefer
a little something we like to call--"|speech
7||"WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH! A wash of VIBRANT COLORS blurs by.
DRAGONS BARREL PAST at a dizzying speed. Their RIDERS SWIPE,
KICK, and ROLL into one another while they WEAVE neck in neck
between the houses, docks, and revamped structures of Berk."|stage direction
8|unknown|"HICCUP (V.O.)
DRAGON RACING!"|speech
9||"It's like an aerial version of the Monte Carlo race.
Spectators ROAR from wooden bleachers, fastened to cliff
faces and perched over the sea.
FISHLEGS, now 20 and even larger, rides his gronkle, MEATLUG,
who carries the sheep in her claws, until...
SNOTLOUT, also 20, but every bit as juvenile, and his
Monstrous Nightmare, HOOKFANG, steal the sheep from them."|stage direction

12|FISHLEGS|Snotlout! That's mine!|speech
13||"Snotlout FALLS BACK toward RUFFNUT and TUFFNUT, who lag on
their two-headed Zippleback, BARF & BELCH."|stage direction
14|SNOTLOUT|Here ya go, babe.|speech
15||"With a chivalrous grin, Snotlout tosses the sheep to Ruffnut.
She SNATCHES it with a sneer and a GRUMBLE."|stage direction
16|SNOTLOUT (CONT'D)|"Did I tell you that you look
amazing today? `Cause you do."|speech
17|RUFFNUT|"Come on, Barf. It's starting to
stink around here."|speech
18||"Barf starts to peel off, spewing gas. Tuffnut mocks Snotlout
with a mugging grin."|stage direction
19|TUFFNUT|"Nope. Still hates you. Let's blow
this place, Belch!"|speech
20||"Belch ignites the gas, sparking a flashy explosion, and
leaving Snotlout behind in the smoke.
As they rush past the main bleachers, Ruffnut DROPS her sheep
into one of five baskets suspended over a chasm at the lap
crossing. Each backboard bears an image of its corresponding
dragon. The Barf/Belch basket filled to the brim with sheep.
Presiding over the game, STOICK turns to the frenzied crowd."|stage direction
21|STOICK|"That's nine for the Twins, Astrid
lags with three, Fishlegs and
Snotlout trail with NONE!"|speech
22||"Stoick eyes an empty basket at the far end, its backboard
painted with an image of Toothless."|stage direction
23|STOICK (CONT'D)|"And Hiccup is... nowhere to be
found. Hmmm.

24|GOBBER|"Scared him off with the big talk,
didn't ya, Stoick?"|speech
25||"WHACK! Snotlout, still smoldering from the blast, gets
CLIPPED from behind. ASTRID, rolls in, astride STORMFLY --
spirited and competitive as ever, and beautiful despite
herself."|stage direction
26|ASTRID|"What are you doing, Snotlout?!
They're going to win now!"|speech
27|SNOTLOUT|"She's my princess! Whatever she
wants, she gets."|speech
28|ASTRID|"Ruffnut?! Didn't she try to bury
you alive?!"|speech
29|SNOTLOUT|Only for a few hours!|speech
30||BACK TO THE RACERS, as they peel away, pouring on the speed.|stage direction
31|SNOTLOUT|"HICCUP (V.O.)
Dragons used to be a bit of a
problem here. But that was five
years ago. Now they've all moved
in. And, really, why wouldn't they?"|speech
32||"The racers chase each other through a sprawling hangar and
into a vast cave, teeming with colorfully painted dragon
stables. They exit through the far side and circle back
through the village, blasting past many of its dragon-
friendly additions."|stage direction
33|SNOTLOUT|"HICCUP (V.O.)
We have custom stables... all-you-
can-eat feeding stations... a full
service dragon wash..."|speech
34||"In the village, a baby Gronkle sneezes, accidentally setting
one of the Viking houses aflame."|stage direction
35|SNOTLOUT|"HICCUP (V.O.)
Even top-of-the-line fire
prevention, if I do say so myself."|speech
36||"Astrid rolls her eyes, peels away from the other dragon
racers, and yanks open a spout on the overhead network of
aqueducts, dousing the flames with a surge of water."|stage direction
37|SNOTLOUT|HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 4.|speech
38||"BACK TO STOICK, amused as he watches the racers round the
island, searching for sheep. He turns to Gobber and nods."|stage direction
39|STOICK|It's time, Gobber.|speech
40|GOBBER|"Righty-ho!
(aloud, to the crowd)
Last lap!"|speech

We can still win this thing!"|speech

46||GOBBER loads the BLACK SHEEP onto a catapult.|stage direction
47|GOBBER|"This is your big moment. Have a
nice flight!"|speech
48||"He pulls the trigger, LAUNCHING the black sheep into the air.
Astrid spots it and steers Stormfly into a steep climb toward
it."|stage direction
49|ASTRID|Up, up, up!|speech
50||"In a flash, Fishlegs and Meatlug blur past, NABBING the
sheep."|stage direction

56||Snotlout sighs, frustrated.|stage direction
57|ASTRID|You guys are fighting for Ruffnut?!|speech
58|RUFFNUT|I'm totally winning!|speech
59||Fishlegs hovers up nest to Ruffnut with a starry-eyed smile.|stage direction
60|FISHLEGS|We're winning together!|speech
61||"She RAMS BARF into Meatlug, sending Fishlegs into an
uncontrolled SPIN. He SLAMS into Snotlout, sending their
dragons TUMBLING head over tail. The crowd goes wild."|stage direction
62|RUFFNUT|No one can stop me now!|speech
63|TUFFNUT|"Except for me. We're attached,
genius!"|speech
64||"He GRABS at the sheep. Ruffnut fights back, inciting a tug-of-
war."|stage direction
65|TUFFNUT (CONT'D)|Quit trying to steal all my glory!|speech
66||"And while they're distracted, Astrid steers Stormfly toward
them, CLOSING IN."|stage direction
67|STOICK|Get `em, Astrid!|speech
68||"It's MY glory! No sheep, no You're always ruining
glory! EVERYTHING!
Astrid leaps off of Stormfly, runs up Belch's spindly neck,

69|ASTRID|Gotcha!|speech

73|STOICK|"Well played! Hahaha!
(gloating, to the crowd)
That's my future daughter-in-law!"|speech
74||"BACK TO ASTRID ON STORMFLY
eyeing the fast-approaching FINISH LINE, unaware as...
FISHLEGS suddenly RAMS Meatlug into Stormfly, sending Astrid
off-course. She recovers and sees Snotlout flying headlong
toward her, war hammer cocked, aiming at Astrid."|stage direction
75|SNOTLOUT|Uh, excuse me.|speech
76|ASTRID|Stormfly!|speech
77||"Snotlout HURLS his hammer. Astrid ducks and rolls Stormfly
out of the way. The hammer catches Fishlegs in the face with
a CLANG. The crowd collectively winces.
Astrid and Stormfly recover from their roll, loop over the
water, and they BLAST past the finish line, DUNKING the black
sheep into their basket!"|stage direction
78|STOICK|"That's thirteen! Astrid takes the
game!"|speech
79||"The crowd COMES UNHINGED. Astrid flies over the crowd,
basking in her victory."|stage direction
80|STOICK|"HICCUP (V.O.)
Yep. Berk is pretty much perfect.
All of my hard work has paid off.
And it's a good thing, too, because
with Vikings on the backs of
dragons, the world just got a whole
lot bigger."|speech
81||EXT. OPEN SKY/ISLAND COASTLINE - DAY|location
82||"(Scene 0300 - AWOL Part One)
A boundless sky. Vast. Clear. Crisp. And from it, a BLACK
SPECK rockets across the horizon. The image of unbridled
freedom."|stage direction
83|STOICK|HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 7.|speech
84||"Tucked into his riding position, HICCUP appears to be part of
TOOTHLESS. They dip, roll and dive, over a sea teeming with
Thunderdrums, pulling off daring maneuvers with honed
refinement, making them seem effortless."|stage direction
85|HICCUP|Yeah!|speech
86||"They jackknife, heading skyward, rolling and tumbling through
the ethereal cloud-scapes and joining high-flying Timberjacks
as they soar in formation.
Hiccup is bound head-to-toe in a snug, aerodynamic flight
suit -- an asymmetrical, functional design of leather and
articulated plates. It has an air of Viking bike leather."|stage direction
87|HICCUP (CONT'D)|"What do you think, bud? Wanna give
this another shot?"|speech
88||Toothless grumbles in protest.|stage direction
89|HICCUP (CONT'D)|Toothless! It'll be fine.|speech
90||"With a click of a lever, he LOCKS the pedals in the flared
tail position. Hiccup then unhooks himself from the saddle."|stage direction
91|HICCUP (CONT'D)|Ready?|speech
92||"Toothless SNORTS unenthusiastically.
Suddenly, Hiccup SLIDES OFF of Toothless, peeling away from
him like a skydiver from a plane, YELLING as he plummets.
Toothless dives after him. They spiral through the air, face-
to-face. Toothless is having fun, despite himself.
Hiccup slips his forearms through a pair of tucked leather
flaps... and YANKS, unfurling SHEETS OF LEATHER as he extends
his arms. They catch the wind, SNAPPING OPEN like WINGS...
and sending him GLIDING -- out of control, at first, then
stabilizing. The turbulence buffets his flight suit heavily.
But he's flying!
Toothless unfolds his wings, too, catching up with Hiccup.
The freedom is palpable. Hiccup and Toothless are, for the
moment, the same. Feeling the same rush of adrenaline.
Independently together.
They PLUNGE past cloud formations, splitting apart then
crossing paths again."|stage direction
93|HICCUP (CONT'D)|HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 8.|speech
94||"Impressive as it is, Hiccup is gliding at a steep angle.
Toothless launches fireballs ahead of Hiccup, boosting him
higher with the expanding heat bursts."|stage direction
95|HICCUP (CONT'D)|This is amazing!|speech
96||"A cloud layer washes past, exposing a towering ROCK
FORMATION, dead ahead."|stage direction
97|HICCUP (CONT'D)|No longer amazing! Toothless!|speech
98||"Hiccup tries to steer himself away, to no avail.
Toothless POURS ON THE SPEED, trying to catch Hiccup as he
HURTLES toward collision. His locked tail makes maneuvering
difficult. He's UNABLE TO PULL UP at a steep enough angle."|stage direction
99|HICCUP (CONT'D)|Oh, no!|speech
100||"At the last second, Toothless BLASTS the jagged rocks just
ahead of Hiccup, then WRAPS Hiccup in his wings as they fly
through it. The obliterated peak rains down around them.
Toothless emerges through the cloud of debris and HURTLES
into the trees of a neighboring peak. They tumble down the
uneven terrain, coming to rest on a small plateau.
Hiccup emerges from the cocoon of Toothless' wings. He
switches his prosthetic riding foot to his walking foot and
stows his leather wings."|stage direction
101|HICCUP (CONT'D)|That really came out of nowhere.|speech
102||The blown up sea stack collapses.|stage direction
103|HICCUP (CONT'D)|"We gotta work on your solo gliding
there, bud. That locked-up tail
makes for some pretty sloppy rescue
maneuvers, eh?"|speech
104||"Hiccup reels in his dorsal fin and removes his helmet,
revealing a 20 year old Hiccup framed by wild hair, complete
with a Viking braid.
He walks to the edge of the cliff, taking in the NEW LAND
stretching off into the horizon, its tall cliffs and sea-
stacks adorned with swaying gold birch trees basking in the
dappled afternoon sunlight."|stage direction
105|HICCUP (CONT'D)|HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 9.|speech
106|HICCUP (CONT'D)|"Looks like we found another one,
bud."|speech
107||"Toothless FUSSES and SNORTS, not amused, shaking off dust and
pebbles like a wet dog.
Hiccup flinches as a pebble WHACKS him on the back of the
head. He looks back to Toothless, who averts his eyes."|stage direction
108|HICCUP (CONT'D)|"Oh, what? Do you want an apology?
Is that why you're pouting, big
baby boo? Well... try this on!"|speech
109||Hiccup TACKLES Toothless and tries to put him in a headlock.|stage direction
110|HICCUP (CONT'D)|"Ya feeling it yet? Huh? Picking up
on all my heartfelt remorse?"|speech
111||"Toothless simply stands on his hind legs, lifting Hiccup off
of his flailing feet and dangling him over the cliff's edge."|stage direction
112|HICCUP (CONT'D)|Oh, come on. You wouldn't hurt a|speech
113||Hiccup looks down, seeing the precipitous drop below.|stage direction
114|HICCUP (CONT'D)|"You're right! You're right! You
win! You win!"|speech
115||"WHAM! Toothless flips him over, pinning him to the ground.
Hiccup squirms, throwing mock punches. Toothless playfully
retaliates with feline taps to Hiccup's head."|stage direction
116|HICCUP (CONT'D)|"He's down! And it's ugly! Dragons
and Vikings, enemies again, locked
in combat to the bitter -- URFFF!"|speech
117||"Toothless rests his head on Hiccup -- SQUEEZING THE AIR out
of him. Toothless then suddenly starts grooming Hiccup,
lapping at his face and covering him in slobber."|stage direction
118|HICCUP (CONT'D)|Gaaaaagh!|speech
119||"Hiccup fights to get free, finally springing to his feet and
shaking off the viscous saliva."|stage direction

121|HICCUP (CONT'D)|You KNOW that doesn't wash out.|speech
122||"Toothless LAUGHS, pleased with himself.
Shifting his attention back to the new land stretched out
before them, Hiccup reaches beneath his chest plate and
produces a leather-bound book.
He unfurls it to reveal an EXPLORERS MAP, modified with added
strips in every direction to accommodate their ever-expanding
world. Drawings indicate new lands, new tribes, and many new
dragons.
Hiccup peels a fresh strip of paper from a hidden fold in his
flight suit and holds it out for Toothless to lick.
Hiccup affixes the moistened strip to the map's outer edge,
then whittles a pencil and consults a compass affixed to his
forearm."|stage direction
123|HICCUP (CONT'D)|So what should we name it?|speech
124||Toothless GURGLES as he gnaws under his wing, preoccupied.|stage direction
125|HICCUP (CONT'D)|"""Itchy Armpit"" it is."|speech
126||Hiccup carefully draws the new island's outline.|stage direction
127|HICCUP (CONT'D)|"Whaddya reckon, bud? Think we might
find a few Timberjacks in those
woods? The odd Whispering Death or
two in the rocks? Who knows...
maybe we'll finally track down
another Night Fury."|speech
128|(BEAT)|Wouldn't that be something?|speech
129|(BURDENED)|So, whaddya say? Just keep going?|speech
130||"Toothless' ear plates suddenly SHOOT UP. He ROARS, and his
call is answered by a familiar SCREECH. Hiccup turns to

been?"|speech
135||"Astrid dismounts and throws back her fur hood as Toothless
rushes up to greet them."|stage direction
136|ASTRID|"Winning races. What else? The real
question is... where have YOU been?"|speech
137|HICCUP|Avoiding my dad.|speech
138|ASTRID|Oh, no. What happened now?|speech
139||"Astrid sits beside Hiccup, inspecting his latest addition to
the map. Behind them, Toothless greets Stormfly, inciting a
play fight."|stage direction
140|HICCUP|"Oh, you're gonna love this. I wake
up. The sun's shining. Terrible
Terrors are singing on the rooftop.
I saunter down to breakfast,
thinking all is right with the
world, and I get..."|speech
141||He gets to his feet and puffs out his chest.|stage direction

(APING STOICK)"|... Son, we need to talk.|speech

(APING HICCUP)"|"Not now, Dad. I've got a whole day
of goofing off to get started."|speech
145||Hiccup breaks character, grimacing at her impression of him.|stage direction
146|HICCUP|"Okay, first of all, I don't sound
like that. What is this character?
And second... what is that thing
you're doing with my shoulders?"|speech

I couldn't be prouder..."|speech

impressed with myself, too."|speech

dorsal fin release button and triggering it to pop up. She
laughs as Hiccup reels it back in, self-consciously."|stage direction

coil. The calibration is very
sensitive!

168|"ASTRID
(EXCITED)"|What did you tell him?|speech
169|HICCUP|"I didn't. By the time he turned
around, I was gone."|speech
170||"Astrid picks up the map, folding it as she paces around him,
processing it all."|stage direction

The map will have to wait for sure,
and I'll need to fly Toothless,
since you'll be too busy..."|speech
172||"She pauses, wincing in sympathy. She turns to Hiccup. He nods
knowingly, taking the map from her."|stage direction

speeches, and planning, and running
the village... that's his thing."|speech

approaches and settles beside him, joining him in looking out

out there, Hiccup."|speech

201||"Astrid falls off of Stormfly, but Toothless SNATCHES her at
the last second.
Stormfly hits the ground, tangled in the net. Trappers rush
out of hiding, piling onto her with ropes and weapons. She
whips her tail, sending spikes flying."|stage direction

down like a rodeo cowboy."|stage direction

205||"Eret deftly ties her gnashing jaws shut, wrangling her into
submission -- clearly a pro among pros. He looks up,

out."|stage direction

What are you doing?"|speech
