Camera left are the elevators -- at back wall directly behind
switchboard are chairs and a table for visitors. Next to
switchboard are stairs leading downward to the next floor. A
waist-high iron grill with a gate in it separates the
switchboard from the anteroom, a similar grill separating it
again from the city room which stretches on beyond
switchboard. At a table in the switchboard enclosure sits an
office boy, about fifteen, doing a crossword puzzle. The big
clock on the back wall shows that it is nearly one o'clock.

23|HILDY|"No, just visiting. Tell me, is the
lord of the universe in today?"|speech
24|MAISIE|"He is -- and in a very bad humor. I

minutes -- is a long time -- to be
away from you."|speech
33|HILDY|"Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard
it, but I just wanted to hear it
again. I can stand being spoiled a
little. The gentleman I'm going to
have a chat with did very little
spoiling."|speech
34||(grimly)|location
35|BRUCE|"I'd like to spoil him just once.
Sure you don't want me to go in with
you?"|speech

The office boy whistles. Bruce pays no attention, but stares
after Hildy.
MEDIUM SHOT - SHOOTING DOWN LENGTH OF CITY ROOM
Hildy starts to walk through City Room.
TRUCKING SHOT - HILDY
as she walks the length of the City Room. It's a long walk,
because it's a room that takes up practically the whole floor.
The scene is a busy one. But, gradually, as Hildy starts
down, one after another recognize her. There are cries of:
""Hildy!"" ""Hello, Hildy"", etc., from the men as Hildy goes
straight down the aisle. She never stops but waves her own
greetings: ""Jim!"" ""Hi, good-looking!"" ""Laura"" ""Hullo, Pop""
""Nan!"" ""Eddie!"" ""Hello, Mac"" ""Pete!"" ""Frank"" ""Oscar!"", and
gets responses from each of them. One man is bent over his
desk reading his copy -- he is standing up. Hildy slaps him
as she goes by. He turns around: ""Say, who did that?"" As he
sees Hildy: ""Hello, Hildy!"" Hildy: ""Hi, Jake."" She passes a
middle-aged woman, almost an Edna May Oliver type, seated at
a desk pounding out copy and smoking a cigarette. As Hildy
comes up to her she slaps the woman on the back."|stage direction

There is a sound of the door closing and Burns, without
looking up, says:"|stage direction
54|BURNS|What do you want?|speech
55|HILDY|"Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's
no way to talk to your wife -- even

that the Governor hasn't signed that
reprieve!"|speech
68|BURNS|What?|speech
69|DUFFY|"And that means Earl Williams dies
tomorrow morning and makes a sucker
out of us!"|speech
70|BURNS|You're crazy. Where's Mac?|speech

Hello -- Mac? Burns. Where's the

can't locate him?"|speech
75||"(apparently pleading
to the one man in
the world who can
help him)"|location
76|BURNS|"Mac, you know what this means. We're
the only paper in town defending
Earl Williams and if he hangs tomorrow
we're washed up! Find the Governor
and when you find him tell him we
want that reprieve!... Tell him I
elected him and I can have him
impeached! Sure, you can do it, Mac --
I know you can. I always said you
were the greatest reporter in the
country and now you can prove it.
Get going! Attaboy!"|speech
77||He hangs up.|stage direction
78||"(to Duffy,
sarcastically)"|location
79|BURNS|"The greatest reporter in the country!
First I gotta tell him what news to
get! Gotta tell him how to get it --
then I gotta write it for him
afterward! Now if you were a decent
City Editor --"|speech

Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a
civil tongue in your head."|speech

91||They go.|stage direction

fans out the match."|stage direction
102|HILDY|How long is what?|speech
103|BURNS|"You know what. How long since we've
seen each other?"|speech
104|HILDY|"Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks --
then Bermuda... Oh, about four months,
I guess. Seems like yesterday to me."|speech
105||CLOSEUP BURNS|stage direction

me in your dreams?"|speech
108||MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT THE TWO|stage direction

proposed."|speech

121||CLOSE SHOT HILDY AND BURNS|stage direction
122||(growling)|location
123|BURNS|I notice you still remember it.|speech

remembered it, I wouldn't have
divorced you."|speech
125|BURNS|"You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you
hadn't done it."|speech
126|HILDY|Done what?|speech
127|BURNS|"Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow
lose faith in himself. It almost
gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted."|speech
128|HILDY|"Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's
what divorces are for."|speech
129|BURNS|"Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned
idea that divorces are something
that last forever -- till 'death us
do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't
mean anything today. It's only a few
words mumbled over you by a judge.
We've got something between us nothing
can change."|speech
130|HILDY|"I suppose that's true in a way. I am
fond of you, Walter. I often wish
you weren't such a stinker."|speech
131|BURNS|Now, that's a nice thing to say.|speech
132|HILDY|"Well, why did you promise me you
wouldn't fight the divorce and then
try and gum up the whole works?"|speech
133|BURNS|"Well, I meant to let you go -- but,
you know, you never miss the water
till the well runs dry."|speech

my dimple. Walter.! It held things
up twenty minutes while the Judge
ran out to watch it."|speech
138|BURNS|"Well, I don't want to brag, but I've
still got the dimple -- and in the
same place -- I just acted like any
husband who doesn't want to see his
home broken up."|speech
139|HILDY|What home?|speech
140|WALTER|"What home? Don't you remember the
home I promised you?"|speech
141|HILDY|"Oh, yes -- we were to have it right
after our honeymoon -- honeymoon!"|speech
142|BURNS|"Was it my fault? Did I know that
coal mine was going to have another
cave-in? I meant to be with you on
our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I
did."|speech
143|HILDY|"All I know is that instead of two
weeks in Atlantic City with my
bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a
coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age
sixty-three -- getting food and air
out of a tube! You don't deny that.
Do you?"|speech
144|BURNS|"Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat
the whole country on that story."|speech
145|HILDY|"Well, suppose we did? That isn't
what I got married for. What's the
good of -- Look, Walter, I came up
here to tell you that you'll have to
stop phoning me a dozen times a day --
sending twenty telegrams -- all the
rest of it, because I'm --"|speech
146|BURNS|"Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you
what. You come back to work on the
paper and if we find we can't get
along in a friendly way, we'll get
married again."|speech
147|HILDY|What?!!|speech
148|BURNS|I haven't any hard feelings.|speech
149|HILDY|"Walter, you're wonderful in a
loathesome sort of way. Now, would
you mind keeping quiet long enough
for me to tell you what I came up
here for?"|speech

his hat)"|location

and you can tell me everything."|speech

158|HILDY|"Don't tell me what to do! We're
divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're
not my husband and you're not my
boss! And what's more, you're not
going to be my boss."|speech
159|BURNS|What do you mean by that?|speech
160|HILDY|Just what I said. That's what I --|speech

work here?"|speech

somebody else! That's the gratitude
I get for --"|speech

five years ago? A little college
girl from a School of Journalism! I
took a little doll-faced mugg --"|speech
170|HILDY|"You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't
been doll-faced!"|speech
171|BURNS|"Why should I? I thought it would be
a novelty to have a face around here
a man could look at without
shuddering."|speech
172|HILDY|Listen, Walter --|speech
173||(going right on)|location
174|BURNS|"I made a great reporter out of you,
Hildy, but you won't be half as good
on any other paper, and you know it.
You need me and I need you -- and
the paper needs both of us."|speech

do without me. And so will you. It
just didn't work out, Walter."|speech

satisfied with just being editor and
reporter. But no! You had to marry
me and spoil everything."|speech

proposed to you!"|speech
180|BURNS|"Well, you practically did! Making
goo-goo eyes at me for two years

I was tight the night I proposed. If
you'd been a gentleman you'd have
forgotten all about it. But not you!"|speech

running after fire engines -- waking
people up in the middle of the night

going to start a war -- stealing
pictures off old ladies of their
daughters that got chased by apemen!
I know all about reporters -- a lot
of daffy buttinskies going around
without a nickel in their pockets,
and for what? So a million hired
girls and motormen's wives will know
what's going on! No, Walter, I'm

can't picture you with a guy who
sells policies."|speech

the office when he's with me. He
doesn't treat me like an errand-boy --
he treats me like a woman."|speech

you -- like a water buffalo?"|speech
252|HILDY|"I don't know about water buffaloes,

sweet and considerate. He wants a
home -- and children."|speech

to marry. What's his name?"|speech

3060|HILDY|"It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs
a wife who can give him a home --

do that for him, Walter. I'm what
you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd
give up her soul for a story!... Is
that job still open?"|speech

and being Mrs. Walter Burns."|speech
3062|HILDY|"Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We
tried it."|speech
3063|BURNS|"Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful!
Only you expected it to be like other
marriages. It can't be like other
marriages -- we're different! We're
a different world. Look at what we
went through today. I wouldn't trade
that for any honeymoon in the world.
I bet you wouldn't, either."|speech
3064|HILDY|"A fine honeymoon, with a murderer
right in the boudoir! And that other
honeymoon in a coal mine!"|speech
3065|BURNS|"That's what makes it romantic. Every
other married couple goes away on a
honeymoon and for two weeks the bride
knows just where the groom is, and
vice versa. But us -- you never know
where I am and I'm not sure where
you are. That's Romance!"|speech

once!"|speech

right. We'll even go to -- how about
Niagara Falls?"|speech

son I can train to take my place on
this paper."|speech

daughter?"|speech
3074|BURNS|"Well, if she looked like you -- Say!
My brains and your looks -- that
mightn't be such a bad combination."|speech
3075|HILDY|What's the matter with my brains?|speech
3076|BURNS|"What's the good of arguing about
something that probably doesn't exist?
Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you.
What do you say?"|speech
