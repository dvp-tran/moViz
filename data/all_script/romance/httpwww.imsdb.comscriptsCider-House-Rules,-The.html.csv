SUPER: ST. CLOUD'S, MAINE, MARCH 1943.
When Larch dozes off, his hand loosens its grip on the cone;
the cone falls off his face, and he wakes up. Then he puts
the cone back in place, dripping more ether from the bottle
to the gauze covering the cone.
Pan the dispensary, which also serves as Larch's photo gallery
and bedroom apartment. The ether-bed is separated from the
room by a hospital curtain (the kind on casters). We see the
recording revolving, the glass-encased cabinets of medical

how can you not feel *obligated* to
help them when they can't get help
anywhere else?"|speech
101|HOMER|"One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask
how to do it--you just showed me."|speech
