The tone of the song would now change - - the older,
wiser person watching as two younger people are
unwittingly falling in love. The tone can still be
light, as are the visuals here, but there would be
an undercurrent of irony and romance. The song would
end as Anya and Dmitri have their first, momentary
embrace.
MONTAGE: (MOS)
ON DECK: Anya, still in her boots, walks gracefully
down the deck in spite of the ship's rocking motion.
Dmitri and Vlad can't even stand due to the motion.
Anya looks back and flashes them a smile.
IN THEIR CABIN: Dmitri gets out of the bed he's
been sharing with Vlad and walks over, past where
Anya is sleeping peacefully, to close the port hole
against a cold wind. He closes is and see's Anya -
she looks beautiful - he bends down to pull up her
covers and she SLUGS him.
UNDER A TABLE: Meetoo is walking around sniffing
feet. Suddenly, he runs smack into the TWO UGLY
PUG DOGS who growl at him. He runs away and finally
see's a woman's foot and a pair of pretty feminine
shoes, with heels, that she has kicked off. Meetoo
grabs them in his mouth and runs.
ON DECK: The sea is calm, but Anya - wearing the heeled
shoes for the first time - is teetering and wobbling
like mad. Dmitri and Vlad watch her with amusement.
Anya turns to them.
ON DECK: Dmitri has stuffed his feet into the woman's
shoes and is barely able to walk as Anya watches him
with great vindication.
BALLROOM: Anya walks -into the ballroom, steady and
graceful in her new shoes, on Vladimir's arm and
completes a perfect curtsy in front of Dmitri. Dmitri
applauds and moves down to her as she stands and smacks
him with her head accidently.
THEIR CABIN: Vladimir is directing Anya as she waltzes
gracefully in their swaying cabin. Dmitri enters and is
directed to join Anya. He does and they dance together,
with Anya clearly leading. The boat sways to the left
and Anya is thrown closer into Dmitri's arms. Neither
of them even try to readjust.

In UPTEMPO ""PARIS IN THE TWENTIES style MUSIC, the people of
Paris ALL SING, welcoming Anya and Dmitri, Sophie and Vlad,
to Paris!
The foursome explores the city and Anya has the
happiest day of her young life. On the streets they
encounter the motley denizens of Paris, as well as
people with very familiar faces -- for anyone in the
audience in the know, they'll see Josephine Baker,
Maurice Chevalier, Rodin, Gertrude Stein, Freud,
Lindbergh - people who were in Paris in the twenties..
For those in the audience who don't recognize them,
they'll simply be unidentified fascinating ""types"" who SING.
As the joyous number progresses, we realize that Dmitri
is feeling something else -- the impending loss of Anya
to a world where she clearly is at home. He SINGS for a
short moment, knowing that he's about to lose her. Anya
visits a couturier and comes out with a big dress box
for her evening at the ballet. A BIG FINALE as they go
off for the evening. Even Meetoo has found some female
poodle companionship. But for one last beat, Dmitri's
wistfulness cuts against joy.
