8|FADE IN:|"They arrived almost half a century
ago. Aliens, Scavs, whatever you
want to call them. Their idea of
how-do-you-do was to blow up our
moon.
Giant waterfalls crash where lava cooled through iron and
concrete. Telephone polls half-buried in sand."|speech|FADE IN:|?

10|FADE IN:|"Without her moon, the earth went
insane. Most were killed in the
floods, as the cities came down,
as everything caught fire. A year
later their ground troops landed,
to exterminate whoever was left.
A station wagon half protrudes from a lava flow. A
child's plastic flip-flops on the dash."|speech|FADE IN:|?

We used the nukes."|speech|FADE IN:|?

Low on the HORIZON, the TET rises with the sun. It's a
WHITE TETRAHEDRON (SIX-SIDED) SPACE STATION that circles
the earth once a day, like an artificial moon."|speech||

15|(BEAT)|"Humanity had to flee the Earth.
We had to unlearn what it meant,
to call something our home. Now
we live on the Tet, our man-made

18|(BEAT)|"An ALARM chirps. A man's hand reaches out of bed,
silences it. The MAN swings his feet onto the floor. He
sits with his face in his hands, waking up. We hear a
SHOWER RUNNING. He looks up.
A WOMAN showers near him, only steamed glass walls
between them. She sees him, smiles at him, without
modesty. He looks back at her.
OVER TITLES. We watch a familiar morning routine:"|speech||
19||INT. A HOME - MORNING|location||
20|(BEAT)|"BATHROOM. The man flicks on a light, stares at himself
in the mirror. This is JACK. Early 40's, a good face
that enjoys rugged living. Tan and weathered skin. His
eyes are curious, kind, almost child-like.
The woman squeezes in next to him, VICTORIA. 30s, a tom-
boy shock of red hair, towel around her neck. She
brushes her teeth.
KITCHEN. Victoria watches the coffee drip, bites toast.
SHOWER. Jack lets warm water blast him in the face.
READY ROOM. Jack pulls a worn high-tech workman's suit
from a locker, revealing a photo taped to the door: It's
of him and Victoria, younger, in a white-walled high-tech
corridor, smiling eager at the camera. He stares at it
for a moment, closes the locker door.
KITCHEN. Victoria hands Jack his coffee. He kisses the
top of her head, heads out to work."|speech||

1,200 feet in the air, literally above the clouds. As
our minds are blown, Jack moves away from the glass-
walled home towards his BUBBLESHIP, a futuristic-cross
between a Bell 47 Helicopter and a jet fighter, and we
CRANE UP UP UP... INCREDIBLE VERTIGO until we're looking
down at this impossible structure. Jack, climbing into
his ship.

below seems to FALL UPWARDS at us, that's how fast we're
diving. There's a small worn BOBBLE-HEAD on the dash
which vibrates with the ship.
Jack is un-phased by the drop, touches a few controls.
VICTORIA (V.O.)
Good morning, Jack. I'll be your
flight attendant for the day.
This is day... three thousand two
hundred and twenty five, in case
you were wondering.
JACK is running instruments. A day at work.."|speech||

She sips her coffee, punches up a feed, multi-tasking

36|JACK|You should come with me sometime.|speech|JACK|M
37|VICTORIA|"No, thank you. Have a nice ride.
The Bubbleship HITS CLOUDS, goes completely blind. Just
vapor and water HAMMERING the canopy like bullets.
On the heads-up display, GPS numbers roll. The readouts
deal with climate, terrain below... Even in this hell,
Jack takes the controls, starts to pilot on instruments.
One of Victoria's boards flashes. She squints as a large
MASS forms near Jack's ship."|speech|VICTORIA|F

five, closing.
The Bubbleship is VIBRATING, buffeted."|speech|VICTORIA|F
39|JACK|"What do you call this?
What does a storm look like inside a storm? Like this.
The WALL OF WEATHER comes out of the wind and rain from
behind Jack's ship, simply eats it up.
Suddenly Jack's going end over end, helpless. Warning
lights flash. Jack punches controls that won't respond."|speech|JACK|M

(a little tense)
Okay, Bob. Need you to work with
me here.
In the Bubbleship, Jack works the display, literally
SMACKS a panel with his fist. Suddenly, the Bubbleship
SURGES with power. Jack regains control as:
INT/EXT. BUBBLESHIP - CONTINUOUS
The Bubbleship BURSTS through low clouds, hurtling down
past turbulence into...
THE SKY ABOVE A BEAUTIFUL DESOLATE PLANET. Mysterious
black sand dunes, active volcanoes, swirling orange and
gold sediment, steaming bright blue hot springs and rich
brown craters.
Jack takes a moment to marvel at it all."|speech|JACK|M
45|JACK|"(under his breath)
""Talkin' 'bout my girl...""
Jack shifts the Bubbleship, in the distance a series of
RESOURCE-GATHERERS on the horizon. Essentially titanic
vacuums, sucking up the oceans.
In front of her console, VICTORIA charts the Gatherers,
and the patrol arcs of their defensive Drones. One
blinks, stalled."|speech|JACK|M

downed last night."|speech|VICTORIA|F

(SMALL SMILE)"|"Absolutely not.
Bar gaucre hits top. Jack punches it.
JACK vibrates in his seat, pinned back. The ship SCREAMS
over the surface, following the signal.
Now A HUGE CRATER opens up in front of him which he DROPS
INTO, barely missing an edge... which seems to have
architecture to it.
The ship skims close along the walls which are revealed
to be rows and rows of stadium seats, half buried in
sand. We're in Giants Stadium, New Jersey.
Old news to Jack. He surveys below..."|speech|JACK|M
51|JACK (CONT'D)|"I see it, looks like full mid-
flight impact. What was its last
destination?
BELOW, through blowing dust, we see a DRONE, a spherical
mechanical weapon, plunged into the sand."|speech|JACK|M

slides it on backwards. He hoists a WEAPON, a carbine-
sized gun on a sling, and checks its charge as he slides
the door open. He's BLASTED with sand and wind which now
suddenly still, like a freight train that's passed."|speech|VICTORIA|F
62|JACK|"Anyway... QB lets off this mile-
high bomb...
The weather's fast and erratic like this. As Jack starts
moving towards the Drone, a heavy mist forms, shrouding
it in grey. There's almost no sound, just Jack's feet on
earth..."|speech|JACK|M
63|JACK (CONT'D)|"The thing just sails the length of
the field.
Victoria anxiously checks a screen, the arc of the Tet's
""vision"" still not covering Jack's location."|speech|JACK|M

still offline.
He pauses. A faint sound on the wind... like a whine."|speech|VICTORIA|F

Everyone's yelling ""Fall down,

Jack looks at the casing... beaten, pried open? He
glances at the ground around him, the dark tunnels.

Jack looks small, vulnerable. Something watches Jack..."|speech|VICTORIA|F

ROVER, an ball-shaped independent gopher, rolls free from
the ship, sprouting wheels..."|speech|JACK|M
77|VICTORIA|"Jack, you need to get out of

Bob, I said I needed...
He turns to find that the ROVER is already there, a
DEUTERIUM FUEL CELL sitting in its payload bay.
A SOUND now reaches Jack. Distant, an animal in pain?
Jack listens, but it's gone. He slots the cell. A
HUMMMM as the Drone powers up, systems coming online.
Jack looks around at the stadium."|speech|JACK|M

He REACHES, flips the Drone's fuel cell door shut.
Drone 166 REACTIVATES. It SURGES UP, weapons POWERING UP

realizing that Victoria has been calling his name."|speech|JACK|M

against the bruised and lightning-fractured sky.
Jack SCANS the horizon with his BINOCS, past deserted
landscape, an early iron-framed skyscraper that came down
semi-intact on its side. Nothing.
He lowers the Binocs, glances upwards to where one of the
HUGE RESOURCE GATHERERS blots out half the sky, breath-

a slot in the Bubbleship. He kneels down, hands working
expertly, producing a full UNFOLDING MOTORCYCLE.

He STARES at the expanse of SHELVES that line the walls,
stripped and empty. Wonder... and disappointment.
He turns to his task, kneels by the Drone. The thing's a

where the entire floor has imploded down seven more
stories. What's left is a PIT, with a building-sized ton
of twisted metal hanging over it...
A single bent GIRDER still spans the hole. Jack tracks
the possibilities... steps out onto the girder. He
reaches up to the suspended wreckage to balance...
IT SHIFTS! A hundred tons of twisted metal just moved an
inch above him. Best leave that alone...
He balances, inching across this metal tightrope.
Finally reaching the other side...
AT THE FAR SHELVES
Jack approaches the wall of books, hundred of them. He
kneels, lifts one, blows dust off the cover: ""THE
EDUCATION OF HENRY ADAMS.""
He steps back, admiring it... SNAP! A BEAR TRAP hidden
in the debris closes around his leg, piercing armor and
flesh. Jack has a second to process and a cable rises
from the debris, goes taught!
JACK is dragged through the dust inhumanly FAST, headed
towards a darkened alcove. He activates a LASER CUTTER
on his cuff, slices through the cable which WHIPS AWAY as
he brings his rifle up, FIRES rounds into the darkness.
INHUMAN SCREAMS. Half animal, half electronic.
Something's in pain, but not retreating, CLOSING ON HIM.
Jack SLICES DOWN, cutting loose the claw, and RUNS FOR IT
back towards the HOLE as his girder is yanked away in
front of him, pulled into the void below.
Jack doesn't slow, reaches the edge, LEAPS!

falling... SLAMMING into the far side. For a moment
dangling over the fall, then Jack hauls himself over the
far side.
