the voices. He carries the stuffed animals through the crowds of people. CLICK.
CLICK. CLICK. His metal brace sounds as he walks.
For a moment, he sees nothing but bodies all around him.
He emerges amongst a huddle of teenagers who wait at a turnstile.
A man in a red and white striped coat takes their tickets and waves them in.
Elijah looks up and sees the sign above the turnstile... ""The Hurricane.""

the metal bars down in front of them.

His small hands feel the cold metal of the interior of the compartment. His
expression changes.
Elijah looks to the stuffed animals in his arms. He presses them to check their
softness. He places the stuffed animals on either side of him on the seat. He's
wedged in between them. Feels good.
He reaches out and touches the hard rusted metal bar in front of him. Elijah
looks a little anxious. Beat.
He pulls off his sweater and wraps it around the bar. It goes around twice before
he ties the arms together. He checks its softness.

angered face as he yells at the frantic woman next to him.
And then the ride speeds up.
The gray circular seats start to spin on their own. The teenagers CHEER.
Elijah's eyes fill with joy as the wind plays against his face.
Suddenly the ride changes directions. The cup-like seats get jerked. Everyone
grabs the metal bars to hold on.
Elijah laughs as he smashes into the stuffed animal on his right. It cushions him
and then falls to the floor of the compartment along with the other stuffed
animal.

Elijah starts his descent.
THE SOUND OF A SUBWAY PULLING IN ROARS UP THE STAIRS.
Elijah has to move fast. He takes the steps with less and less hesitation. He's
moving with great agility... and then his foot catches on a step.
His hand slips away from the railing...
He falls down the remaining part of the stairs. The FIRST SICKENING CRACK is
heard when his hand reaches out to stop his fall.
The SECOND CRACK IS MORE LIKE A CRUNCH AS HIS LEG LANDS AWKWARDLY ON THE METAL
STAIRS.
He comes to a stop in a pile on the dirty gum stained floor of the subway
landing. His jaw is locked in a HORRIFIC SCREAM THAT GETS EATEN BY THE ROAR OF
THE SUBWAY TRAIN PULLING IN.
His contorted anguished face sees the turnstiles of the subway upside down. The
green army jacketed man looks back at Elijah with a blank expression pushing
through the turnstile.
The last thing Elijah sees before he blacks out, is the tail of the man's coat
riding up as he move through the turnstile. The SILVER HANDLE OF A GUN peeks out
from the belt of his pants."|stage direction||

David watches as a massive muscular player takes a seat on the massage table and
removes his dress shirt. His body is covered in old bruises. He lays down,
wincing a bit from the pain. A trainer begins to massage him.

David stares at something in the crowded room then he starts towards it.
He moves through the room of players and trainers. He moves to the one area of

David comes to a step at the foot of an Olympic bench press. Racks and racks of
free weights sit behind the press.
David looks down at the thick silver bar. Three large black plates are on either
side. Six in all.
David looks back and glances at the double doors where he should be standing.
Beat. He looks to the twenty or so players and trainers in the room. Some of the
players have headphones on. Some are staring into space. A couple are on cell

No one notices David Dunne as he reaches for a forty-five pound black plate off
the weight rack.
The huge disc slides onto the bar with almost NO SOUND...
A matching forty-five pound disc goes on the other side...
And then David adds another. He matches it on the other side...
THE BENCH CREAKS just the slightest bit as David takes a seat.
No one notices the security guard lay back on the bench.
David's hands take hold of the shiny bar.
He closes his eyes...
David's arms become tense. He pushes against the weight. It doesn't move.
His face turns deep red. He opens his eyes and stares at the bar as he keeps
training. His face and arms are shaking... He keeps staring... focusing.
And then, without any fanfare, the bar lifts off the arm rest.
The weight hovers over David. He lowers it to his chest for a second time. His
arms aren't shaking anymore. He pushes the weights back up.

frozen with a plate of half-eaten, now moldy eggs at one setting and two bowls of
colorful cereal in another. The cereal has dissolved in the old milk. Two
cockroaches are crawling in the bowl.
David moves slowly to a door in the kitchen. It's slightly open. As David gets
closer, he shields his face from the strong smell. He pulls the door open
quietly.
A SHAFT OF KITCHEN LIGHTS FALLS DOWN THE STAIRS INTO THE BASEMENT. At the bottom

pounded by the rain.
David uses his hands to push his body off the tarp. His hands sink into the water
as his pressure pushes the tarp down.

David stops pushing. His vision catches the corner of the swimming pool as the
tarp slides out from under the sand bags that hold it in place.
The tarp sags. David becomes utterly still. THE SOUND CONTINUES ANYWAY.

David's only free hand reaches for the light. It catches the silver pole.
The tangled mass of David and the tarp are pulled slowly towards the edge of the

pool's edge.
Huge desperate breaths as he pulls his body out from the water and the grasp of
the tarp. He hauls himself onto the ground.
He sits hunched over in a dark mass, his head down under his hood. The rain

He doesn't notice the third presence come into the room. He doesn't hear him move
closer. Right behind him.
The man in orange takes another sip of his beer, not realizing an arm is reaching
over him... He doesn't get to swallow the sip in his mouth.
David Dunne's powerful arm wraps around the man's thick neck. David's hands clamp
together like and iron vise. He squeezes.
The man's beer bottle crashes to the ground as his neck begins to get crushed.
David yanks back hard, pulls the man off balance. The man's legs push back
violently, sending both of them backwards across the room. They come to a hard
stop as David's back gets RAMMED INTO THE BEDROOM WALL.
The huge man in orange pulls away and then SLAMS DAVID harder against the wall.
David's arm remains locked around his throat.
The man becomes frantic. His face turning dark red. He clutches at David's arm.
He spins, taking David with him into another wall. The IMPACT IS TREMENDOUS. The
room shakes. David holds on. His face bent low and hidden under his hood.
And then the man in orange throws a powerful elbow back. It lands hard right in
David's side. David groans. The huge man delivers another one. Savage, desperate
blows. WE HEAR THE IMPACT OF EACH ONE WITH DAVID'S BODY. And David never lets go.
The elbows slow and then stop. The legs of the man in orange start to buckle.
David pulls him back onto his heels. He turns him in a half circle. All of his
tremendous weight is hanging from David's arm now. David LETS OUT A YELL AS HE
APPLIES ALL HIS STRENGTH. The man's legs stop kicking.
David keeps turning him. The man's body goes completely limp. David's just
dragging two hundred and seventy-five pounds of weight in a circle over the

David slowly comes to a stop. He stands there with his arm wrapped around the
