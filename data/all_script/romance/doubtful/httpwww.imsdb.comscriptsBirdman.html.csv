4||"Close on the brilliant colors of a middle eastern rug, the
center of what seems to be a makeshift ""meditation"" space.
We slowly tilt up to discover the back of Riggan Thomson (55).
He is in the proper `Lotus' position, dressed only in tight
white briefs and he appears to be meditating deeply. And if all
this seems a little odd, it becomes all the more so when you
notice that he is levitating almost two feet above the floor.
His breath is calm and measured... in and out... in and out.

breathing continues. We see a clock on the wall, ticking.

MAN (V.O.)"|unknown
11||We don't belong in this shithole.|location
12||"A Skype call shatters the silence. Close on his back, we follow
Riggan as he walks over to the computer and answers the call.
On the computer screen appears Sam (21), in a pair of Levi's
and a Led Zeppelin T-shirt. She has simple and striking good
looks, with an edge in her voice and behind her eyes. She
stands in a Korean Deli among the flowers, talking to Riggan
through her iPhone."|unknown

SAM
Dad? What kind of--
(Turning to Korean.)
SHUT UP!!!
(Back to screen.)
What kind of flowers did you say you
wanted?
RIGGAN
Alchemillas. Or something soothing that
smells nice. Listen I can't--
SAM
It all smells like fucking Kimchi!
RIGGAN
Then whatever looks nice. Anything but
roses. No roses.
KOREAN
Flowers don't need you touch! They need you
buy!!!
SAM
(Close into the screen.)
I hate this job.
And the Skype call is over. Riggan closes the laptop and leans
forward trying to regain his calm. His reflection appears in
the mirror, and for the first time we see his face. He has a
dark goatee and his hair looks strangely abundant. There is a
piece of paper on the mirror with the handwritten phrase ""A
thing is a thing, not what it is said of that thing.""
ANNIE ON SPEAKERS
Riggan, they're starting scene
five. We need you on stage.
RIGGAN
Shit...
Riggan throws on a sweater and stumbles into his slacks. He
hurries out..."|unknown

of activity as various workers and stage hands appear and
disappear carrying equipment and scenery. As Riggan descends the

RIGGAN

Okay.
Riggan continues on until he arrives backstage. He runs into
Jake (42) his producer and friend.
JAKE
How's it going, buddy.
RIGGAN
Great. It'd be even better if I
could get Ralph to stop acting like
he's in an educational video for

kitchen.
Around the kitchen table sit Lesley (35), plain and no nonsense,
her simple hairstyle and makeup can't hide how attractive she
is. Laura (35), dark, exotic, the kind of woman who makes every
person she meets feel like she's seducing them. And Ralph (40),
slightly handsome, slightly balding, slightly invisible.
A half empty bottle of gin on the table, they drink from
highball glasses as they chat...
LESLEY
He loved me.
RALPH
Yeah. He loved her so much he tried
to kill her.
LAURA
He tried to kill you?
LESLEY
No. (A beat.) Okay, well, he did
beat me up one night. He dragged me

28|RIGGAN|"I'm the wrong person to ask. I didn't
know the man. I've only heard his name
mentioned in passing. You'd have to
know the particulars. But I think what
you're saying is that love is absolute."|speech

is... The kind of love I'm talking about,
you don't try and kill people."|speech

of the bushes or from behind a car and just
start shooting."|speech

Jake runs toward the stage.
JAKE
Someone call 911!
Riggan slowly backs away from the chaos.
LAURA
Is that blood coming out of his
ear?
JAKE

Okay, he's breathing. What did he
have for lunch?

his hair. As it comes off his head, we discover it was a wig.
He turns away from the mirror, trying desperately to stay
calm. Something catches his eye: a vase of roses on the end
of the table. A card in them says, ""They didn't have the
whatever you wanted - Sam"". Enraged, Riggan focuses on the
vase. It begins to shift. Then, with a surge of anger,
without ever touching it, he sends it crashing against the
wall on the other side of the room.

We stay with Riggan, who seems to be thinking about

he grabs the side of the window with one hand and begins to
step up onto the sill.
The camera pans away from him to a table that has some photos
propped on it: One of he and Sam when she was a child. One
with Sylvia and Sam. A copy of Carver's ""What we talk About
When We Talk About Love"" laying on the surface.
