You have a choice in this world, I
believe, about how to tell sad
stories."|speech

- Hazel and the BOY we will come to know as AUGUSTUS ""GUS""
WATERS (17) at an outdoor restaurant in some magical place.
[They look very much like the perfect Hollywood couple.]"|stage direction

On the one hand, you can sugar coat
- the way they do in movies and
romance novels."|speech
5||"- ""Perfect"" Hazel and ""Perfect"" Gus sit on a BENCH
overlooking an incredible seascape in some foreign country.
She rests her head on his shoulder."|stage direction

that can't be fixed with an apology
and a Peter Gabriel song."|speech
11||"BACK TO Hazel on the grass, still watching the stars. Were
those dreams or were they memories? Still unclear."|stage direction

Late in the Winter of my 17th
year..."|speech
19||"There are, however, some key and obvious differences.
First, you'll notice the OXYGEN TUBE in her nostrils which
help her to breathe.
Second, you'll notice her hair - which we couldn't see in the
grass. It's much shorter than the ""Perfect"" version, the
result of someone whose head was completely shaved a few
years before."|stage direction
20|unknown|"HAZEL (V.O.)
... my mother decided I was
depressed."|speech
21|HAZEL|I'm not depressed.|speech

mother FRANNIE (early 40s, younger than she feels) explains
to the DOCTOR:"|stage direction

32|HAZEL (V.O.)|"Depression's not a side effect of
cancer..."|speech

middle of the afternoon. Her Mom brings her a sandwich. A
glass of water. And then a whole host of prescription meds.
Hazel eyes them with indifference."|stage direction
34|HAZEL (V.O.)|... it's a side effect of dying.|speech
35||"- A STARBUCKS. Hazel sits alone reading a dog-eared, heavily
underlined copy of a novel (""An Imperial Affliction"" by Peter
Van Houten). She only looks up when distracted by a squeal of
delight. A YOUNG GUY has lifted a YOUNG GIRL over his
shoulder playfully. He spins her around. Hazel watches a beat
- goes back to the book."|stage direction
36|HAZEL (V.O.)|Which is what was happening to me.|speech
37||"And we CUT BACK TO:

40|DOCTOR|"I may switch you to Zoloft. Or
Lexapro. And twice a day instead of
once."|speech
41|HAZEL|Why stop there?|speech
42|DOCTOR|Hmm?|speech
43|HAZEL|"Keep `em coming. I can take it. I'm
like the Keith Richards of cancer
kids."|speech

Group I suggested?"|speech
46||Instead of answering, Hazel looks at her Mom.|stage direction
47|DOCTOR|4.|speech

69||As Hazel watches, bored, and Patrick continues, we hear:|stage direction
70|PATRICK|"HAZEL (V.O.)
I'll spare you the gory details of
Patrick's ball cancer. Basically,
they found it in his nuts, cut most
of it out, he almost died, but he
didn't die, and now here he is -
divorced, friendless, addicted to
video games, exploiting his
cancertastic past in the heart of
Jesus - ""literally"" - to show us
that one day - if we're lucky - we
could be just like him."|speech
71||They all say:|stage direction
72|PATRICK|"ALL IN UNISON
""We're here for you Patrick."""|speech
73||"Hazel says it the least enthusiastically. She locks eyes with
her only friend in Support Group, a blonde kid with an eye
patch, ISAAC. He's also shaking his head."|stage direction
74|PATRICK|Who else would like to share?|speech
75|(NO RESPONSE)|Hazel?|speech

stands, sighs..."|stage direction
77|HAZEL|I'm, uh, Hazel. 16.|speech
78|(BEAT)|"Thyroid originally but with quite
the impressive satellite colony in
my lungs."|speech
79||Not much more to say, Hazel is about to sit down.|stage direction
80|PATRICK|And how are you doing Hazel?|speech
81||Hazel has no idea how to answer that.|stage direction
82|PATRICK|"HAZEL (V.O.)
You mean besides the terminal
cancer?
6."|speech
83||But that's not what she says. She says:|stage direction
84|HAZEL|Alright? I guess...?|speech
85||Isaac tries not to laugh at this. Hazel sits back down.|stage direction
86|HAZEL|"ALL IN UNISON
""We're here for you Hazel."""|speech
87||Hazel exhales. This is not at all helpful. A few more beats.|stage direction
88|PATRICK|Maybe now I'll play a song...|speech
89||"EXT CHURCH - LATER
Frannie sits in the car in the parking lot, reading from a
book, waiting for Group to be over. She sees the church door
open and puts the book away. Hazel comes out. Frannie looks
at her like ""well, was it great?"" Hazel just exhales and gets
in the car. CUT TO:
INT HAZEL'S LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY
""America's Next Top Model"" is on the TV. Hazel sits on one
side of the L-shaped couch, flipping through her novel.
Frannie and Hazel's dad MICHAEL (40s, kind, doing his best to
stay positive) sit on the other side, watching her - but
trying not to make it seem that way. After a few beats:"|stage direction
90|FRANNIE|It's Friday night.|speech
91|HAZEL|Hmm?|speech
92|FRANNIE|"I was just thinking... you should
call your friends, see what they're
up to."|speech
93|"HAZEL
(DISINTERESTED)"|That's ok.|speech
94||Frannie and Michael look at one another, don't say anything.|stage direction
95|MICHAEL|Wanna see a movie?|speech
96||Hazel looks up from the book. Sees her parents. Gets an idea.|stage direction

100||Frannie and Michael look at one another again.|stage direction
101|MICHAEL|This is a really good show.|speech
102||"Hazel sighs. And just like that, everyone goes back to what
they were doing. CUT TO:
QUICK SEQUENCE, which plays over:"|stage direction

And that was my life."|speech
104||"- Hazel watching TV, book in hand.

111|MICHAEL|"Hazel, you need to get out of the
house. Make friends. Be a teenager."|speech
112|HAZEL|"If you want me to be a teenager,
don't send me to Support Group. Buy
me a fake ID so I can go to clubs
and drink gimlets and take pot."|speech
113|MICHAEL|"You don't take pot.

114|HAZEL|"See, that's the kind of thing I
would know with a fake ID."|speech

And so I went..."|speech
118||Frannie's car pulls up close to the back entrance.|stage direction
119|"FRANNIE
(BEAT)"|"HAZEL (V.O.)
Not because I wanted to or because
I thought it would help. But for
the same reason I did anything
these days..."|speech
120||"Hazel, oxygen tank in toe, gets out of the car with Frannie's
assistance."|stage direction
121|"FRANNIE
(BEAT)"|"HAZEL (V.O.)
... to make my parents happy."|speech
122|HAZEL|"Are you gonna sit here and wait the
whole time?"|speech
123|FRANNIE|"Of course not, no. I...
(she totally is)
I have errands to run."|speech
124||"Hazel knows she's not planning to run any errands. She
doesn't press the issue."|stage direction
125|HAZEL|Ok.|speech
126|FRANNIE|Love you.|speech
127|HAZEL|"Love you too Mom.
HAZEL (V.O.)
The only thing worse than biting it
from cancer - is having a kid bite
it from cancer."|speech
128||As Frannie gets back in the car, she shouts to her daughter:|stage direction
129|HAZEL|9.|speech
130|FRANNIE|Make some friends!|speech
131||"Hazel just shakes her head. CUT TO:
INT CHURCH - SAME
Hazel walks towards the elevator. An EXTREMELY SICK LOOKING
KID holds it open for her. Hazel thinks better of it."|stage direction
132|HAZEL|I'll take the stairs.|speech
133||"The KID nods. The doors shut. Hazel is reminded - it could
always be worse. She turns to go, walking right into:"|stage direction
134||"Ooph. Sorry!
A SUPREMELY BEAUTIFUL BOY (we will come to know him as GUS).
Tall, lean, muscular, straight short mahogany hair, blue
eyes. Hazel has never seen a better looking kid in her life."|stage direction
135||"My bad. No, it's...
For a brief moment, the Earth stops. They stand looking at
one another. Hazel is speechless."|stage direction
136|HAZEL|Excuse me.|speech
137||"With the Beautiful Boy watching, a wan smile on his face,
Hazel shuffles off as fast as she can, ducking into:
INT BATHROOM - SAME
Hazel catches her breath. Shakes her head. Surprised at
herself.
She looks in the mirror. So doesn't like what she sees. The
Earth starts moving again. CUT TO:
INT CHURCH BASEMENT - LATER
Hazel sits in the Circle of Sick."|stage direction
138|PATRICK|Who would like to begin?|speech
139||"No volunteers. Hazel catches sight of the Beautiful Boy,
sitting next to Isaac. He seems to be watching her, that same
flirty smile on his face. She self-consciously looks away."|stage direction
140|PATRICK|10.|speech
141|PATRICK|"Isaac, I know you're facing a
challenging time. Perhaps you would
like to say something..."|speech
142||Isaac nods, rises.|stage direction
143|ISAAC|"Yeah, um... I'm Isaac. 17. Eye
cancer."|speech
144|(BEAT)|"It's looking like another surgery
in a couple weeks. After which,
well, I'll be blind..."|speech
145||"Hazel tries to focus on what Isaac's saying but it's
difficult. She still feels the Beautiful Boy's gaze on her."|stage direction
146|ISAAC|"Not that I'm complaining or
anything. I know a lot of you have
it way worse but, still, I mean,
you know, being blind's gonna
suck..."|speech
147||"As Isaac shares, the Beautiful Boy doesn't look away from
Hazel. Hazel finds this intimidating. And intimidation
irritates her. So she decides to play the game with him,
meeting his gaze and holding it just as firmly.
A staring contest."|stage direction
148|ISAAC|"...My girlfriend helps. And friends
like Augustus here..."|speech
149||"Isaac nods towards the Beautiful Boy who now has a name -
AUGUSTUS. He still doesn't look away from Hazel."|stage direction
150|ISAAC|"So... yeah. That's what's up.
ALL IN UNISON
""We're here for you Isaac."""|speech
151||The staring contest continues another few beats until:|stage direction
152|PATRICK|And does your friend want to speak?|speech
153||"This causes the Beautiful Boy to momentarily look away. Aha,
he's lost the contest! Hazel smiles, flicks her eyebrows up
as if to say ""Victory is mine!"" He smiles back at her, the
most radiant smile on the planet. He turns back to the Group."|stage direction
154|GUS|"Hi. I'm Augustus Waters. 17. Had a
touch of osteosarcoma bout a year
and a half ago - lost this baby as
a result...
11."|speech
155||Gus holds up his right leg - a prosthetic.|stage direction
156|GUS|"But really I'm just here at Isaac's
request."|speech
157|PATRICK|And how are you feeling Augustus?|speech
158|GUS|"Me? Oh I'm grand. I'm on a roller
coaster that only goes up, my
friend."|speech
159||"Hazel smiles. Gus catches this. Embarrassed, she stops
smiling and looks away."|stage direction
160|PATRICK|"Perhaps you'd like to share your
fears with the group, Augustus."|speech
161|GUS|My fears?|speech
162||Gus thinks about this.|stage direction
163|GUS|Oblivion.|speech
164|PATRICK|Oblivion?|speech
165||ANGLE ON Hazel, intrigued.|stage direction
166|GUS|"Yeah, see... I intend to live an
extraordinary life. To be
remembered. If I'm scared of
anything it's... not doing that."|speech
167||Patrick doesn't quite have the tools to deal with that.|stage direction
168|PATRICK|"Would, uh, anyone like to speak to
that?"|speech
169||And Hazel's hand goes up. Even Patrick is surprised by that.|stage direction
170|PATRICK|Hazel! That's unexpected.|speech
171||"Hazel stands, takes a second to gather her thoughts. Augustus
watches her, waits for it."|stage direction
172|HAZEL|"I just wanna say... there will come
a time when, you know, all of us
are dead."|speech
173||Gus is now even more fixed on her than before.|stage direction
174|HAZEL|12.|speech
175|HAZEL|"It might be tomorrow. Might be a
million years from now but... it's
gonna happen. And when it does,
enough generations will come and
go, there'll be no one left to
remember Cleopatra. Or Mozart. Or
Muhammad Ali, let alone any of us,
right?"|speech
176||The look on Gus's face is unreadable.|stage direction
177|HAZEL|"Oblivion's inevitable. And if that
scares you, well, I suggest you
ignore it. God knows it's what
everyone else does."|speech
178||"A beat. And then an enormous smile spreads across Gus's face,
not a flirty smile but a surprised one, a real one. CUT TO:
EXT OUTSIDE THE CHURCH - LATER
Hazel waits for her Mom's car to appear.
Across the parking lot, she sees Isaac going at it with a
redhead, MONICA (17), sucking face like there's no tomorrow
against the door of her green Pontiac Firebird. Between
kisses, we can hear:"|stage direction
179||"Always. Always.
And Hazel hears:"|stage direction
180|GUS|Literally.|speech
181||"Hazel turns to find the Beautiful Boy, Augustus, standing
right next to her."|stage direction
182|GUS|"I thought we were in a church
basement but apparently we were
literally in the heart of Jesus."|speech
183||Hazel smiles.|stage direction
184|HAZEL|"Someone should probably tell him,
don't you think? Jesus? Seems kinda
dangerous keeping all these kids
with cancer in your heart."|speech
185||Gus laughs.|stage direction
186|GUS|"What's your name?
13."|speech
187|HAZEL|Hazel.|speech
188|GUS|No your full name?|speech
189|"HAZEL
(CONFUSED)"|Hazel Grace Lancaster.|speech
190||Gus nods to himself, smiles. Still fixated on her.|stage direction
191|HAZEL|What?|speech
192|GUS|I didn't say anything.|speech
193|HAZEL|"Why are you looking at me like
that?"|speech
194|GUS|Because you're beautiful.|speech
195||Hazel is taken aback. No one's ever said that to her before.|stage direction
196|GUS|"I enjoy looking at beautiful people
and I decided a while back not to
deny myself the simpler pleasures
of existence. Particularly given
that, as you so astutely pointed
out, we're all gonna die pretty
soon."|speech
197|"HAZEL
(BEAT)"|I'm not beaut --|speech
198||A CUTE YOUNG GIRL walks past them.|stage direction
199|YOUNG GIRL|Hey Gus.|speech
200|GUS|Hey Alisa.|speech
201||"Hazel isn't surprised that other girls know Gus. Of course
they do. She turns back towards Isaac and Monica pawing at
each other. She hears:"|stage direction
202||Always. Always.|stage direction
203|HAZEL|"What's with the ""always?""
14."|speech
204|GUS|"""Always"" is their thing. They'll
""always"" love each other and
whatnot. Must have texted ""always""
to each other at least four million
times this year."|speech
205||"They continue to watch the show. It's pretty gross. Isaac
squeezes Monica's breast like a clown horn."|stage direction
206|HAZEL|He's gotta be hurting her boob.|speech
207|GUS|Let's watch a movie.|speech
208||Hazel is again surprised.|stage direction
209|HAZEL|"Oh. Um. Uh...
(yes!)
Sure. Yeah. I'm... pretty free this"|speech
210|"WEEK--
GUS"|No I mean now.|speech
211|HAZEL|What?|speech
212|GUS|Hmm?|speech
213|HAZEL|"What do you mean ""now?"""|speech
214|GUS|I've got a car.|speech
215||He shrugs. Hazel has never seen someone so confident.|stage direction
216|HAZEL|You could be an axe murderer.|speech
217|GUS|There is that possibility.|speech
218|(BEAT)|Come on Hazel Grace... take a risk.|speech
219||"As Hazel mulls this over, Gus reaches into his pocket and
pulls out, of all things, a pack of cigarettes! Hazel is in
disbelief. He flips the box open, puts a cigarette between
his lips."|stage direction
220|HAZEL|"Oh my god. Oh. My. God. You're
kidding right?
(off his look)
You just ruined the whole thing!
15."|speech
221|GUS|Whole thing?|speech
222|HAZEL|"What, you think that's cool? Oh you
idiot! There's always a hamartia,
isn't there? And yours is - even
though you had FREAKING CANCER you
give money to a corporation for the
chance to acquire EVEN MORE
CANCER!? Ugh. And you were doing so
well."|speech
223||"As she rants, Gus continues to look at her with that smile on
his face. Hazel does not find it so amusing."|stage direction
224|HAZEL|"Let me tell you... not being able
to breathe? Sucks. Totally sucks."|speech
225|GUS|Hamartia?|speech
226||Hazel folds her arms and turns away from him.|stage direction
227|HAZEL|A fatal flaw.|speech
228||"Gus takes a beat and then moves to face her, the smile still
etched on his face."|stage direction
229|GUS|"They don't hurt you unless you
light them."|speech
230|HAZEL|Sorry?|speech
231|GUS|I've never lit one.|speech
232||Hazel turns back to him.|stage direction
233|GUS|"It's a metaphor. See? You put the
thing that kills you between your
teeth. But you don't give it the
power to do the killing."|speech
234||Hazel is floored. And impressed.|stage direction
235|HAZEL|Metaphor.|speech
236||Gus holds her gaze. And it's at this point Frannie pulls up.|stage direction
237|FRANNIE|"Hi sweetheart. Ready for some
""Model?""
16."|speech
238||"Hazel looks at Gus, cigarette dangling from his lips. Cool as
anything. Handsome as hell. She looks back at her mom."|stage direction
239|HAZEL|"Can't tonight.
(off her confused look)
I've made plans with Augustus
Waters."|speech
240||"And with that, she walks off. Frannie looks at the boy with
the cigarette in his mouth. This could be trouble. Or
awesome. Or both. And we CUT TO:
INT GUS'S CAR - LATER
Hazel is terrified. Turns out, Gus is the world's worst
driver. When he brakes, her body flies forward against the
seatbelt. And when he hits the gas, seconds later, her neck
snaps back in the seat. Gus sees the look on her face."|stage direction
241|GUS|I failed the test a couple times.|speech
242|HAZEL|You don't say.|speech
243|GUS|"Most amputees can drive with no
problem but... yeah. Not me."|speech
244|HAZEL|I'm surprised you have a license.|speech
245|GUS|Tell me about it!|speech
246||Another brake forces Hazel against the seat belt.|stage direction
247|GUS|"The fourth time I took the test...
it was going about how this is
going... and when it was over, the
instructor looks at me and goes,
""your driving, while unpleasant...
is not technically unsafe."""|speech
248|HAZEL|Aha. Cancer perk.|speech
249|GUS|Total cancer perk.|speech
250||A few beats of silence.|stage direction
251|GUS|So what happened to you?|speech
252||"Hazel takes a deep breath. She's told this story before but
somehow this seems different."|stage direction
