comfortable but he's been there a while
ON THE SCREEN
A bare bulb shines down on the contents of a shabby hotel

in a straight backed wooden chair in his blood-stained T-

room behind him.  A legend:"|stage direction

ANATOLY, an imperious Russian in his forties, a Russian
godfather.  The THUGS and HOOKERS are ushered out.  ANATOLY
looks down at KASIMOV pitiously and urges him to go and sit
by him in a chair he picks up for him.  KASIMOV does as he is
bid, looking gratefully up at ANATOLY.  They speak in Russian
which is subtitled."|stage direction

ETHAN goes quickly to the body of the dead woman. He cheeks
the pulse in her neck, shines a penlight in her eye. He
strips the adrenalin kit and jabs the long needle into the
dead woman's thigh.  He checks her pulse again, checking a
stopwatch.  In about ten seconds, the woman's eyes open.
CLAIRE is her name, a French woman of thirty or so. She half
rolls over, GROANS, and wipes some of the blood from her
mouth."|stage direction

a cigarette out of a pack, and taps it nervously on the
armrest.
AT THE FRONT OF THE CABIN.
The FLIGHT ATTENDANT opens a case loaded with video 8
cassettes of feature films.  She opens a panel in the top of
the case and withdraws a tape hidden back there.
BACK AT PHELPS' SEAT
The ATTENDANT returns with the tape and hands it to PHELPS.
He takes it without a word and she moves on.
PHELPS reaches down and turns a lever on the support between
his seat and the empty one beside him. He flips up a small
movie screen and angles it toward himself, away from the
other passengers. He puts on a headset, opens a door in the
armrest, and puts the tape in.
He presses play.
ON THE TAPE,
the image of a man comes on.  EUGENE KITTRIDGE is fortyish,
but seems permanently stuck in the Nixon era -- horn rimmed
glasses, short short haircut, rather be caught dead than
tieless.  But if he catches your eye, he will never, ever
look away.  He's seated at a desk, looking into the camera."|stage direction

89|KITTRIDGE|"Good morning, Mr. Phelps.  The man you're
about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn --"|speech

presumably taken from a concealed camera as GOLITSYN walks
down a foreign street."|stage direction

working the international black market
selling intelligence.  This morning, we
learned that Golitsyn has stolen one half

official cover agents working in Eastern
Europe."|speech
92||"The screen shows an image of what such a list might look
like, code names and other information scrolling by on a
computer screen at high speed."|stage direction
93|KITTRIDGE (O.S.)|"For security reasons, the NOC list is
divided into two encoded halves.
Golitsyn already has the cryptonym
portion, which contains agent code names
and targeting areas.  This portion is
useless unless combined with the second
half -- the true name list that is kept
in the CIA station in our Embassy in Prague."|speech
94||"The Embassy itself comes on screen, a beautiful old building
at the base of the Charles Bridge, which spans the Vltava
River."|stage direction
95|KITTRIDGE (O.S.)|"We believe Golitsyn plans to steal the
true name list at an Embassy function
tomorrow night.  Your mission, should you
decide to accept it, is to obtain
photographic proof of the theft, apprehend
those involved, and return the stolen
list.  I don't have to stress the
importance of this matter, Jim.  We're
keeping it internally black. Because of
its urgency, I've already sent to Prague
a team selected from your usual group."|speech

seen -- JACK KIEFER, CLAIRE and ETHAN."|stage direction

your IM force be caught or killed, the
Secretary will disavow all knowledge of
your actions.  This tape will self-
destruct in five seconds.  Good luck,
Jim!"|speech
