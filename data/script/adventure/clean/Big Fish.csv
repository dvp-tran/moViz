Final Production Draft"|unknown|||
1||"This is a Southern story, full of lies and fabrications, but
truer for their inclusion.
FADE IN:
A RIVER.
We're underwater, watching a fat catfish swim along.
This is The Beast."|stage direction|||
2|EDWARD (V.O.)|"There are some fish that cannot be
caught. It's not that they're faster
or stronger than other fish. They're
just touched by something extra.
Call it luck. Call it grace. One
such fish was The Beast."|speech|EDWARD|M|True
3||"The Beast's journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited
with worms. Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun. Past
a swiping bear claw. The Beast isn't worried."|stage direction|||
4|EDWARD (V.O.)|"By the time I was born, he was already
a legend. He'd taken more hundred-
dollar lures than any fish in Alabama.
Some said that fish was the ghost of
Henry Walls, a thief who'd drowned
in that river 60 years before. Others
claimed he was a lesser dinosaur,
left over from the Cretaceous period."|speech|EDWARD|M|True
5||INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (1973)|location|||
6||"WILL BLOOM, AGE 3, listens wide-eyed as his father EDWARD
BLOOM, 40's and handsome, tells the story. In every gesture,
Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with
absolute conviction."|stage direction|||
7|EDWARD|"I didn't put any stock into such
speculation or superstition. All I
knew was I'd been trying to catch
that fish since I was a boy no bigger
than you."|speech|EDWARD|M|True
8||(closer)|location|||
9|EDWARD|"And on the day you were born, that
was the day I finally caught him."|speech|EDWARD|M|True
10||EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT (1977)|location|||
11||"A few years later, and Will sits with the other INDIAN GUIDES
as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe."|stage direction|||
12|EDWARD|"Now, I'd tried everything on it:
worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut
butter-and-cheese. But on that day I
had a revelation: if that fish was
the ghost of a thief, the usual bait
wasn't going to work. I would have
to use something he truly desired."|speech|EDWARD|M|True

18||"While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks
bored. He's heard this story before."|stage direction|||
19|EDWARD|"I tied my ring to the strongest line
they made -- strong enough to hold
up a bridge, they said, if just for
a few minutes -- and I cast upriver."|speech|EDWARD|M|True
20||INT. BLOOM FRONT HALL - NIGHT (1987)|location|||
21||"Edward is chatting up Will's pretty DATE to the homecoming
dance. She is enjoying the story, but also the force of
Edward's charisma. He's hypnotizing."|stage direction|||
22|EDWARD (CONT'D)|"The Beast jumped up and grabbed it
before the ring even hit the water.
And just as fast, he snapped clean
through that line."|speech|EDWARD|M|True
23||"WILL, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave. His
mother SANDRA -- from whom he gets his good looks and
practicality -- stands with him at the door."|stage direction|||
24|EDWARD|"You can see my predicament. My wedding
ring, the symbol of fidelity to my
wife, soon to be the mother of my
child, was now lost in the gut of an
uncatchable fish."|speech|EDWARD|M|True

down-river for three days and three
nights, until I finally had him boxed
in."|speech|EDWARD|M|True
31||Will regards his father with exasperated contempt.|stage direction|||
32|EDWARD|"With these two hands, I reached in
and snatched that fish out of the
river. I looked him straight in the
eye. And I made a remarkable
discovery."|speech|EDWARD|M|True

34||"WILL, now 28, sits with his gorgeous bride JOSEPHINE. This
is their wedding reception, crowded with their friends and
family. They should be joyful, but Will is furious.
Edward has the floor, ostensibly for a toast. The room is
cozy and drunk."|stage direction|||
35|EDWARD|"This fish, the Beast. The whole time
we were calling it a him, when in
fact it was a her. It was fat with
eggs, and was going to lay them any
day."|speech|EDWARD|M|True
36||"Over near the doorway, we spot Sandra, just returned from
the restrooms. She looks gorgeous. She couldn't be any happier
if this were her own wedding."|stage direction|||
37|EDWARD|"Now, I was in a situation. I could
gut that fish and get my ring back,
but doing so I would be killing the
smartest catfish in the Ashton River,
soon to be mother of a hundred others."|speech|EDWARD|M|True
38||"Will can't take any more. Josephine tries to hold him back,
but he gets up and leaves. Edward doesn't even notice."|stage direction|||
39|EDWARD|"Did I want to deprive my soon-to-be-
born son the chance to catch a fish
like this of his own? This lady fish
and I, well, we had the same destiny."|speech|EDWARD|M|True

43|SANDRA|Honey, it's still your night.|speech|SANDRA|F|True
44||Will can't articulate his anger. He just leaves.|stage direction|||
45|EDWARD|"Now, you may well ask, since this
lady fish wasn't the ghost of a thief,
why did it strike so quick on gold
when nothing else would attract it?"|speech|EDWARD|M|True
46||"(closer; he holds up
his ring)"|location|||
47|EDWARD|"That was the lesson I learned that
day, the day my son was born."|speech|EDWARD|M|True
48||"He focuses his words on Sandra. This story is -- and has
always been -- about her more than anyone."|stage direction|||
49|EDWARD|"Sometimes, the only way to catch an
uncatchable woman is to offer her a
wedding ring."|speech|EDWARD|M|True
50||"A LAUGH from the crowd.
Edward motions for Sandra to get up here with him. As she
crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not
lessened their affection for each other.
As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little way.
The crowd APPLAUDS.
Edward toasts the happy couple. Josephine covers well for
her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer.
Edward downs his champagne in a gulp."|stage direction|||
51||EXT. OUTSIDE LA RUE 14° - NIGHT|location|||
52||"We come into the middle of an argument on the sidewalk.
Occasional PASSERSBY take notice, especially as it gets more
heated. Both men are a little drunk."|stage direction|||

about his son?"|speech|EDWARD|M|True
54||(disbelieving)|location|||
55|WILL|"I am a footnote in that story. I am
the context for your great adventure.
Which never happened! Incidentally!
You were selling novelty products in
Wichita the day I was born."|speech|WILL|M|True

58|WILL|"Friend of yours? Did you help him
out of a bind?"|speech|WILL|M|True
59|EDWARD|"Come on, Will. Everyone likes that
story."|speech|EDWARD|M|True
60|WILL|"No Dad, they don't. I do not like
the story. Not anymore, not after a
thousand times. I know all the
punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as
well as you can."|speech|WILL|M|True
61||(closer)|location|||
62|WILL|"For one night, one night in your
entire life, the universe does not
revolve around Edward Bloom. It
revolves around me and my wife. How
can you not understand that?"|speech|WILL|M|True

65|EDWARD|Sorry to embarrass you.|speech|EDWARD|M|True

You just don't see it."|speech|WILL|M|True
68||"ANGLE ON Edward. Fine. A hand to wave, enough of you.
He walks away.
ANGLE ON Will, still fuming with righteous anger. It's then
we FREEZE FRAME."|stage direction|||

my father again for three years."|speech|WILL|M|True

desk."|stage direction|||

73|WILL (ON PHONE)|"William Bloom with the Associated
Press if I could just..."|speech|WILL|M|True
74||"He's put back on hold. Returning to the mail, he finds a
hand-addressed envelope. Rips it open."|stage direction|||
75|WILL (V.O.)|"We communicated indirectly I guess.
In her letters and Christmas cards,
my mother would write for both of
them."|speech|WILL|M|True
76||INT. BLOOM HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY|location|||
77||"At the table, Sandra talks on the phone while Edward fixes a
sandwich."|stage direction|||

85|WILL (V.O.)|"The truth is, I didn't see anything
of myself in my father, and I don't
think he saw anything of himself in
me. We were like strangers who knew
each other very well."|speech|WILL|M|True
86||EXT. RIVER - DAY|location|||
87||Edward stares intently into the water, a lion in wait.|stage direction|||
88|WILL (V.O.)|"In telling the story of my father's
life, it's impossible to separate
the fact from the fiction, the man
from the myth. The best I can do is
to tell it the way he told me."|speech|WILL|M|True
89||"We LOOK DOWN at the river, where Edward's reflection is caught
in the dark water. As the water ripples past, something
changes.
Sure enough, as we LOOK UP again, it's a younger EDWARD BLOOM,
20's, staring into the water. He's not just handsome, not
just charming. It's as if all the forces of the natural world
had conspired to create him."|stage direction|||
90|WILL (V.O.)|"It doesn't always make sense, and
most of it never happened."|speech|WILL|M|True
91||"Suddenly, this Edward thrusts both hands into the water,
grabbing hold of
THE BEAST.
He brings the catfish up to his face. Looks it right in the
eye. A beat, then the Beast spits out Edward's gold ring."|stage direction|||
92|WILL (V.O.)|"But that's what kind of story this
is."|speech|WILL|M|True
93||"Smiling, Edward takes the ring, then throws the Beast back

give me one good push. On three.
One..."|speech|YOUNG DR. BENNETT|F|
98||"Suddenly, we hear a POP as a slimy mass of human being rockets
into the doctor's unprepared hands. Bennett tries to hold
tight, but the infant is slippery like a fish. It shoots up
into air.
The NURSES and the Husband try to grab the baby, but no one
can hold it. As the newborn sails upward TOWARDS CAMERA, we
can see a GIGGLING SMILE on its face.
As it falls, the newborn knocks over a tray, which provides
it a ramp to slide right out of the room. Everyone races
after it."|stage direction|||

out a collective sigh of relief."|stage direction|||

for his unlikely life. No longer
than most men's, but larger. And as
strange as his stories got, the
endings were always the most
surprising of all."|speech|WILL|M|True

105||"Over the sound of rain, a phone RINGS on a chair. By the
tone of the ring, we know we're not in the U.S. -- it has
that insistent European sound.
As it keeps RINGING, we look to see the apartment is mostly
empty, just a few half-unpacked boxes. A cradle is still in
its carton.
KEYS in the lock. LAUGHTER in the hallway. The door swings
open to reveal a drenched Will (29) carrying four sacks of
groceries, the bottoms collapsing from the rain. His wife
Josephine (28) pushes past him to get the phone."|stage direction|||

welcome spiel in French. Will has a window seat in coach.

are asleep, including Josephine. Her head is propped against
Will's shoulder, her hands tucked under her belly.
Will watches her sleep, brushing back her hair. A beat, then
he notices a BORED BOY in the next row over.
Off the glow of the reading light, the boy is using his hands
to cast shadows on the seat back. The kid is pretty good,
making a convincing bird, a passable monkey, and finally a
dog.
We PUSH IN on the silhouettes."|stage direction|||

bones to cast spells and curses that
make the land infertile."|speech|ADULT EDWARD|?|
170||"We PULL BACK, and BACK, revealing more of the Gothically
creepy house: its broken windows, strangling vines, and eerie
gargoyles half-buried in the dirt. Even bats are afraid to
fly over it.
In the moonlight, the house is especially sinister. Who knows
what is lurking in the shadows?"|stage direction|||

Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door.
The doorknob is ancient brass, two projections that look
like horns. Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and
closer before he finally
RINGS THE DOORBELL.
Impossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an OLD WOMAN with
