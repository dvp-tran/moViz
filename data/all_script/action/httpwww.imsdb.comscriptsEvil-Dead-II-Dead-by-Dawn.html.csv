sharply silhouetted figure steps in the newly created
doorway. The figure lights a torch that he holds,
illuminating his face.  This is PROFESSOR RAYMOND
KNOWBY.  An intelligent, grey bearded man in his late
fifties. He lowers the cloth around his face that had
been protecting him from the sand.  He stares at the
Book, awestruck.
Behind him, two other figures appear in the entrance of
the tomb. The first is a large school-marmish woman,
the wife of Raymond Knowby, HENRIETTA. She moves to
Raymond's side and takes his hand.  Immediately behind
her is their daughter, ANNIE KNOWBY; twenty-four years
old, strong stance and beautiful.  Behind her a
handsome looking man, ED GETLY, enters the tomb.  He
moves to Annie's side.  They exchange excited glances.

Somewhere in the distance a DRUM SOUNDS.  Ash stands
frozen.  Terrified, unsure of where or when he is.
Knowing only for the present, he is alive.
As the wind kicks up blowing dust, Ash strikes a
familiar pose.  It is the same image of the ""Hero
from the Sky"" that we saw earlier in the film.  The
strange ""jagged edged longsword"" is Ash's chainsaw.
The CAMERA PULLS BACK from him as a great medieval castle
rears up INTO FRAME.  It is seen to be the castle of
Kandar.  The same castle we saw in the beginning of the
film.  Now, however, the castle is not a ruin, but brand
new.  As the CAMERA continues to pull back from Ash, the
title ""EVIL DEAD"" appears on the screen acompanied by
the distant ROAR of some dying animal:  The SCREEN cuts
