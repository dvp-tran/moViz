3||"Blinding in their white uniforms, naval flag officers sit
in the audience, showing their support for THEODORE HAYES,
a 50-year-old civilian.  This is his confirmation hearing.
Reading from prepared material:"|stage direction
4|HAYES|"... last few years have brought many
advances in the interests of women
in naval service, particularly in
the land-based maritime specialties.
What's more, the Navy has instituted
special sensitivity courses with an
eye on --"|speech
5|DEHAVEN|"Whoa, whoa, whoa.  ""Land-based
maritime specialties."" Gimme a
second here to de-euphemize that..."|speech
6||"At the center of a dais, LILLIAN DEHAVEN leans back to
ponder the ceiling of the hearing room.  Her plaque card
reads ""CHAIRPERSON -- SENATE ARMS COMMITTEE."" DeHaven is a
tough-hided old Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara at 60.
In her arsenal she carries conversational hand-grenades --
and she's apt to pull a pin at the slightest whim."|stage direction
7|DEHAVEN|"Would that be anything like
""typing""?  ""Restocking the
cupboards""?  That sort of thing, Mr.
Hayes?"|speech
8||"CHUCKLES from the packed gallery.  The flag officers go
stone-faced.  Hayes forces a smile."|stage direction
9|HAYES|Hardly the case, Senator.|speech
10|DEHAVEN|"Well, I'm just an old dame without
much time left, so you'll pardon me
if I jump right in here before they
discontinue my blood-type.  I am
deeply concerned over the Navy's
seemingly incontrovertible attitude
toward women in the military.  Case
in point..."|speech
11||"On cue, aides begin distributing reports to other members
of the dais.  Hayes gets a copy, too.  And it jars him."|stage direction
12|DEHAVEN|"""The Lark Report."""|speech
13|HAYES|"Madam Senator... this is an internal
document of the U.S. Navy.  I must
seriously question whether --"|speech

15|DEHAVEN|"The Navy's conclusion regarding the
crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft
carrier.  Female aviator, it just so
happens."|speech

17|DEHAVEN|"You're familiar with this report and
its conclusion, am I right?"|speech
18|HAYES|"I was one member of the investigating
commission."|speech
19|DEHAVEN|"Yes, I see your signature right here
-- twice the size of everyone
else's.  And your conclusion was
""pilot error,"" hmm?"|speech
20|HAYES|"I'm really not prepared for any kind
of in-depth review of --"|speech
21|DEHAVEN|"I'd like to think our next Secretary
of the Navy would be prepared for
anything, Mr. Hayes."|speech
22||"A humorless smile.  She's roasting his nuts over an open
fire, and everyone knows it."|stage direction
23|HAYES|"The commission concluded that the
aviator in question failed to
execute a proper approach to the
carrier."|speech
24|DEHAVEN|"That aside for the moment, I'm
struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit
of your report... the degrading
remarks by other aviators...
innuendo about her performance in
unrelated situations... even a
reference to her sexual activity the
weekend prior."|speech
25||(closing report)|location
26|DEHAVEN|"In my seven years on this committee,
I've never seen a downed aviator
treated like this.  Never.  I'm
deeply disturbed by this report, Mr.
Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for
women in the military -- but for
your own confirmation as well."|speech

PRESS RETINUE."|stage direction
29|DEHAVEN|"... a full 35 percent of all jobs in
the U.S. military are still, to this
day, off-limits to women.  And
that's simply gotta change."|speech
30|PRESS #1|"What about those who say women
aren't suited for all jobs?  That
they're physically weaker... they
have less stamina..."|speech

bathroom, too."|speech

stockings while devoting one ear to..."|stage direction
37|WHITE HOUSE #1|"... to reassure you that he has
every faith in the ability of Mr.
Hayes to guide the Navy into the
next century.  The task, as the
Administration sees it, is to
acknowledge changing realities
without losing traditional values."|speech
38||"A beat.  DeHaven looks between the two WHITE HOUSE boys --
#1 young and eager, #2 older and cagier."|stage direction
39|DEHAVEN|"'Zat it?  Ten minutes, nothin' on
the table?  Sweetcakes, you best go
back to the President and tell him
to open up the phone book and start
lookin' for his next nominee."|speech

briefcase.  An inch-think report appears before DeHaven."|stage direction
41|WHITE HOUSE #2|"Administration's plan for 100
percent integration.  If female
candidates measure up in a series of
test cases, the President will
support full integration within
three years' time."|speech
42||"Surprised -- maybe even startled -- DeHaven flips through
the report, absorbing by osmosis."|stage direction
43|WHITE HOUSE #2|"It's your gender-blind Navy,
Senator.  Surely you're not going to
balk now."|speech
44|DEHAVEN|"Well, it's just that askin' you all
to integrate the Navy is like
sending a man to do a woman's job."|speech

Combat Exclusion Laws?"|speech
47|WHITE HOUSE #2|"Keep narrowing the definitions.
Keep redefining."|speech

49|DEHAVEN|"By calling women ""Honorary Men.""
Ingenious."|speech
50|WHITE HOUSE #2|"C'mon, Senator, President's pitchin'
right down the center of your plate.
If women measure up to men, they've
got the job.  You going to take a
swing?  Or step out of the box?"|speech

Every bit as tough -- and we have a
60 percent drop-out rate among the

Overtaking the floes.
CLOSER on JORDAN O'NEIL.  She pushes her flat-water kayak
downriver, paddling hard and clean, making good time.
Gliding through the graceful arches of the Arlington
bridge, she passes...
Cars overhead.  Grid-locked by snow conditions.
In seconds Jordan paddles clear, leaving the traffic

accesses the file of her brain.  Drifting past the

protected, most heavily monitored in
the world.  The civilian population
is so propagandized that it acts as
an Early Warning system.  Extraction

I'd go with Seals over Delta Force.
Problem is, don't want to hold a
conventional sub off-shore for
target practice.  Where's The Polk?"|speech

up the package, links up with
recovery sub.  But don't waste time
opening and closing hatches.  They
just grab the periscope and hang on
for neutral waters."|speech
