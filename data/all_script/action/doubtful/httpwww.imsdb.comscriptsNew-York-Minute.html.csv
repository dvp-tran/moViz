3||EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAWN|location
4||"CLOSE ON the anxious, sweating, frightened face of DREW
MacLEOD, 17, running to save her life. Think Dustin
Hoffman in Marathon Man -- someone, something -- is after
her but UNSEEN.
She glances fearfully behind at her mysterious pursuer,
her BREATHING becoming more labored.
Cutting through a deserted park, she leaps a bench.
Above her, the thin morning sun has only begun to lighten
the leaves.
Around the corner, she's back on a sidewalk lined with
beautiful homes, all quiet at dawn, the only noise her
racing FOOTSTEPS and quickening BREATHS.
DREW'S POV - HER OWN FRONT DOOR
and safety loom half a block down. She pours on the
effort, hurdles a hedge, jumps the stairs and makes the
door, rips it open, bolts inside and SLAMS it shut.
ANGLE ON THE SHRUB
where, with the CAMERA AT GROUND LEVEL, a GOLDEN
RETRIEVER PUPPY, unable to leap the hedge, PLOWS INTO IT
HEADFIRST and disappears. YELP!"|stage direction

from her pocket, takes a hit, then peeks out the window
in the front door and sees...
DREW'S POV
The puppy squeezes through the hedge, wiggling its bum to
extricate itself. A SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL picks it up, hugs
it close:"|stage direction

10||"CLOSE ON A JAPANESE EXECUTIVE (with a CLOCK in his belly)
which suddenly begins SCREAMING IN JAPANESE, ITS JAW
WAGGING.
From under piles of clothes and sheets, PARKER MacLEOD,
17, Drew's twin sister, opens one eye, shuts OFF the
shrieking ALARM CLOCK.
With a SIGH, she throws her feet  over the edge of the
bed. Her room is a train wreck.    Grabbing a MatchBox 20
T-shirt from the pile on the bed,  she gives it a sniff.
Good enough. Pulling it on, she   pauses, looks a bit
concerned down at her navel.
A recent belly-button piercing looks a little red. She
touches it. Ouch. When a RINGING is heard, she begins
tossing clothes, blankets, shoes, trying to unearth the
source.
She pulls her BLACKBERRY from under the covers:
THOREAU 786:   MADE CRITICAL ERROR LAST P.M.
Parker snickers, types her return from...
NOTATWIN:   CONFESS
THOREAU 786:   DROPPED TRIPLE DEPTH CHARGE AFTER DINNER.
NOTATWIN:   THAT MUCH CAFFEINE IS ILLEGAL IN UTAH.
THOREAU 786: THEN BOUGHT 'NO MONEY DOWN' REAL ESTATE
COURSE AROUND 3:00 A.M.
This makes her smile.

13||"Drew stands before the mirror, perfecting perfection. In
a tasteful suit, hair just so, she opens the drawer...
... which is hyper-organized, everything in a little
labeled nook. She pulls out tweezers and we see beneath
where it says, ""tweezers.""
She leans into the mirror very close, spots a stray
eyebrow hair, plucks it. Pulling back, she raises her
other eyebrow. Huh. Now they're not even."|stage direction

She leans in again and plucks one from the other eyebrow.
Uh-oh. This is like when your mom cuts your hair and
keeps cutting to get it even until you're shaved. She
reaches for the other side... but suddenly catches
herself and stops. Deep breath. Let's not get too
psychotic.
She dunks the tweezers in the alcohol jar, then replaces
them.
Checking her teeth, she spots a stuck bit.       Grabbing her
WATER PICK she begins cleaning her teeth."|stage direction

Blackberry down we get our first glimpse of...
... HER SIDE OF THE    BATHROOM which resembles a post-
apocalyptic toiletry    landscape. There's a very clear
line of demarcation    on the counter like the demilitarized
zone separating the    Koreas.
Parker reaches among the rubble for her toothbrush but
notices another message on her Blackberry:
THOREAU 786:     KNOW WHAT TODAY IS?
NOTATWIN:     ANOTHER DAY IN HELL?
THOREAU 786:     TWO WEEKS SINCE OUR FIRST CHAT.
NOTATWIN:     OUR ANNIVERSARY.    HOW SWEET.
THOREAU 786: SINCE IT'S A SPECIAL OCCASION, MY REAL
NAME'S WARREN COLLIER. IF YOU'RE EVER IN THE CITY, I'D
LOVE TO MEET. GOTTA GO.
Accompanying the text, a PICTURE Warren has sent finishes

off the counter and PLOPS into the toilet.
ON THE TOILET BOWL -- there it is, slowly sinking.
Parker is stone-faced. She looks to her sister's side of
the counter where a fresh brush sits in the flowered
holder. She's considering... she's reaching... then...
nah.
Instead, she squeezes the tube straight into her mouth,
brushes with a finger and spits."|stage direction

Parker's clearly a chip off her Dad's block. Both pour
milk first into their bowl, then Charley drops in Super
Sugar Crisp while Parker pours in Count Chocula. Both
hit 'em with a couple of spoons of extra sugar.
Mom takes a seat, too, primly eating a piece of dry wheat
toast that she slices in half first. Like Mom, like
