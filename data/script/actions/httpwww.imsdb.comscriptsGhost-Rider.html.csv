My Father used to say that the only way
Evil came into your life was if you
invited it. I'm not sure about that, at
least not anymore. What I cLQ know is
this: we are born alone, and we die
alone, and what happens in between is all
that matters. The choices we make, the
people whose paths we cross -- these are
the things that determine our fate.
