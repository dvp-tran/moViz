WHITE SNEAKERS sitting opposite FANCY HIGH HEELS. These
feet aren't nuzzling. There's distance here.
PULL UP, REVEALING CAL WEAVER (42) and his wife, TRACY

white sneakers in fancy French restaurant).
Cal pulls out READING GLASSES, looks at the menu."|speech

hear it. You're sitting there

vodka-cranberries like a fourteen-

bored. Maybe all my friends have
abandoned me for wives and
children and labradoodle puppies,
who cares why? Why doesn't
matter. The point is, you've got
a good face, and a good head of
hair, and I'm bored as hell and

1484|CAL (CONT'D)|"I met my soulmate when I was
fifteen years old. And I have
loved her with everything I have
for every minute, of every day,
ever since she let me buy her that
first mint chip ice cream. I have
loved her through the birth of our
three perfect children, and I have
loved her even as I've hated her --
only married couples can truly
understand that one. And I don't
know what will wind up happening
with us -- I don't, Robbie, I'm
sorry I can't give you that -- but
I promise you this: I will never
stop trying. When you find `the
one' you never give up trying...
and I love you, my amazing boy,
for reminding me of that.
Robbie hugs his father as the crowd reacts. Cal kisses
his son on the head, then motions towards the microphone.
Robbie grabs it with newfound gusto and announces:"|speech
1485|ROBBIE|"I still love you, Jessica! I've
loved you since the first time you
changed my sister's diaper! I've
loved you since...
The crowd reacts (LAUGHS, CHEERS, etc.) as Robbie
continues. Cal stands back and smiles. His boy is back."|speech
1486||104 EXT. GRADUATION CEREMONY - LATER 104|location
1487|ROBBIE|"The ceremony is over. Robbie heads over to his family.
They hug him, kiss him. Cal approaches Hannah and Jacob."|speech
1488|CAL|Hi, Nanna.|speech
1489|HANNAH|"Daddy.
He smiles at her, adoring."|speech
1490|CAL|"My perfect girl.
He kisses her forehead, turns to Jacob."|speech

1492||104 CONTINUED: 104|stage direction
1493|CAL|"I already ordered a gun. I'm not
kidding. I ordered a Colt .45 on
a shady internet site, I can show
you the receipt. If you hurt her,
I am prepared to shoot you in the
face."|speech
1494|JACOB|Cal, I'm not going to --|speech
1495|CAL|"Shut up, Jacob.
Jacob shuts up."|speech
1496|CAL|"Wow. I like that.
Jacob smiles, shakes hands with Cal. Cal notices:"|speech
1497|CAL|Is that a new shirt?|speech
1498|JACOB|"Hannah took me to the Gap. It's
actually not as bad as I thought."|speech
1499|CAL|Seriously?|speech
1500|JACOB|"Of course not, Cal. It's the Gap.
I got this at Nordstrom's.
And like that... order is restored in the universe.
OVER TO ROBBIE
Who approaches Jessica."|speech
1501|ROBBIE|It was nice of you to come.|speech
1502|JESSICA|"I wouldn't have missed it.
Awkward."|speech
1503|ROBBIE|So, how are things with your dad?|speech
1504|(CONTINUED)|119.|speech
1505||104 CONTINUED: (2) 104|stage direction
1506|JESSICA|"Strained. I took a summer
internship up at Stanford, gonna
head up there early. Figure it
can't hurt to get out of his line
of sight for a while."|speech
1507|ROBBIE|Yeah, probably a good idea.|speech
1508|(THEN)|"You were a good baby-sitter,
Jessica. I'm sorry if I made you
uncomfortable.
He holds out his hand, to shake, formally."|speech
1509|JESSICA|"Wait: I thought you weren't
giving up."|speech
1510|ROBBIE|"I'm not. But I figure: you like
my dad, and one day I'll look like
my dad, so I'll just come for you
then.
Jessica smiles."|speech
1511|JESSICA|"It's a good plan.
She looks over her shoulder, reaches into her purse."|speech
1512|JESSICA|"Until then: a little graduation
gift. To help get you through
high school.
She hands him something in an ENVELOPE: the same type of
envelope she once used for...
Robbie peeks inside. His eyes BUG OUT. Jessica kisses
him, sweetly, on the cheek."|speech
1513|JESSICA|"You take care, Robbie.
Robbie watches her go. Love-struck once more. Cal steps
up next to his son."|speech
1514|CAL|You okay, buddy?|speech

1517|"ROBBIE
(RE: ENVELOPE)"|"I am now, Dad. I am now.
Robbie runs off to join his friends. Cal smiles.
TRACY (O.S.)
I'm terrified of what's going to
become of him once he hits
puberty.
Cal turns, Tracy has been watching."|speech
1518|CAL|"We might have to lock him up.
Tracy smiles. Cal walks over toward her."|speech
1519|TRACY|"You gave a good eighth grade
graduation speech."|speech
1520|CAL|"I've been working on it for thirty
years, so...
She LAUGHS, then... quiet."|speech
1521|TRACY|"Do you think we can ever come back
from all this, Cal?"|speech
1522|CAL|"I don't know. I'd like to try
though. I know I'd like to try.
She nods, thinking."|speech
1523|TRACY|"Things are just so messed up. And
it's been such a strange year.
I've been in such a strange place.
And we have all these problems, so
many problems I've lost count, but
at the end of the day, I mean, the
only thing I know --
She stops herself, emotional. Then, simply:"|speech
1524|TRACY|"I am just so glad you took me for
that ice cream.
Cal smiles. They share the moment in silence. And then:"|speech
1525|(CONTINUED)|121.|speech
1526||104 CONTINUED: (4) 104|stage direction
1527|TRACY|It was rocky road by the way.|speech
1528|CAL|"No!
As they JOKE and ARGUE about what flavor the ice cream
was, we PULL BACK.
Off to the side, Robbie steps away from his friends and
watches them enjoy one another's company.
He smiles.
FADE OUT."|speech
