it is moving at a rate which suggests that its sole male
occupant is looking for house numbers, we can assume that

282||INT. MANSION - DAY|location
283||"The doorbell rings. A HOUSEBOY comes into the front hall,
goes to the door and opens it for the visitor. It is John
Clifford, the detective from six years ago.
He has aged noticeably over the years. His hair is grayer,
his stance not so aggressive, but his eyes still smoulder
with the accumulated frustration of having spent years in an
uncertain, sometimes unsatisfying, and frequently unsafe
occupation.
No words are exchanged as the houseboy leads Clifford across
the entrance hall and up an imposing flight of stairs. Still
keen in his observation of things, Clifford quickly takes in
this new atmosphere.
The house is richly decorated but with an underlying theme
of melancholy. There are no bright or cheerful furnishings,
and the houseboy advances with guarded tread, his face steady
and reverent.
The houseboy stops before a door at the top of the staircase
and raps lightly on it with his knuckles. Without waiting

out at her from every alley and recessed doorway she passes.

thought penetrates her own drowsiness. She turns very slowly

She doesn't get a dial tone. She quietly pushes the phone's
disconnect button up and down several times. Still no dial
tone.
Jill hangs up and thinks for another moment, apprehension
creeping over her face.
Then, in the darkness of the bedroom, she begins to hear the
muttering of a man's voice, low and deep. It is Duncan in
the throes of Guy du Marraux.
Jill freezes. As the voice gets steadily louder and more
menacing, her attention focuses on the door to the bedroom
closet which is a couple of inches ajar."|stage direction

It is Duncan!!
Jill shrieks, and makes a move to leap out of the bed.
Duncan, the hideous and terrifying sound of his madness
grumbling out of his throat, manages to grab the back of her
nightgown.
As Jill struggles to get off the bed, the gown rips slightly
while she fights to get away.
Duncan rolls to her side of the bed and manages to grab Jill's
ankle while letting go of the gown. It causes Jill to lose
her balance and tumble onto the floor just short of the
doorway leading out of the room.
Duncan is on her in a flash, clutching at her and moving his
hands for her throat. Jill screams again. It is the desperate
sound of a woman facing certain death.
Suddenly, two quick shots ring out, overwhelming all other
sound. Duncan falls back with a groan and a thud.
Out of the darkness of the hallway steps Clifford, pistol in
hand. He crosses to Duncan. He is dead. Then Clifford walks
around the room to the far side of the bed and looks down.
On the narrow strip of floor between the bed and the wall
lies John. Clifford nudges the body with his foot. John stirs,
as if he has been knocked unconscious, but it will be some
time yet before he comes to.
Clifford starts to walk out of the room, stepping over
Duncan's body, edging past Jill who is propped up in the
doorway, sobbing hysterically."|stage direction
