CAMERA MOVES to a CLOSE SHOT of the desk. In the background
is a revolving door leading to the street. Through the
revolving door comes a strangely dressed individual, obviously
one who doesn't belong in such surroundings. It is Comrade
Buljanoff, a member of the Russian Board of Trade. Despite
the spring climate of Paris, he still wears his typical
Russian clothes, consisting of a coat with a fur collar, a
fur cap, and heavy boots.
Buljanoff glances around the lobby, obviously over-whelmed
by its magnificence. The Manager, puzzled by Buljanoff's
strange appearance, approaches him."|stage direction

monsieur?"|speech
7|BULJANOFF|No, no.|speech

customary duties, when suddenly a second Russian, similarly
dressed, pushes his way through the door and gazes around.
It is Comrade Iranoff.
The Manager, definitely mystified by now, approaches him."|stage direction
9|MANAGER|Yes, monsieur?|speech
10|IRANOFF|Just looking around.|speech
11||"Iranoff exits. Again the Manager returns to his duties, when
suddenly he sees that a third man, dressed in the same
fashion, has appeared in the revolving door. It is Comrade
Kopalski.
Kopalski doesn't leave the revolving door at all but as it
turns, drinks in the whole spectacle of the lobby. The Manager
is by now dumfounded.
STREET IN FRONT OF THE HOTEL CLARENCE
A taxi stands at the curb. Buljanoff and Iranoff are waiting
beside it, Iranoff holding a suitcase. Kopalski, returning
from the hotel, joins the group."|stage direction

other? It's wonderful."|speech

like it in Russia?"|speech

15|ALL THREE|No, no, no.|speech
16|IRANOFF|"Can you imagine what the beds would
be in a hotel like that?"|speech
17|KOPALSKI|"They tell me when you ring once the
valet comes in; when you ring twice
you get the waiter; and do you know
what happens when you ring three
times? A maid comes in -- a French
maid."|speech

eye)"|location

let's go in."|speech
20||(stopping him)|location
21|BULJANOFF|"Just a minute -- just a minute -- I
have nothing against the idea but I
still say let's go back to the Hotel
Terminus. Moscow made our reservations
there, we are on an official mission,
and we have no right to change the
orders of our superior."|speech
22|IRANOFF|"Where is your courage, Comrade
Buljanoff?"|speech

the barricades? And now you are afraid
to take a room with a bath?"|speech

""Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in
your life you're in Paris. Don't be
a fool. Go in there and ring three
times."""|speech
29|IRANOFF|"He wouldn't say that. What he would
say is ""Buljanoff, you can't afford
to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't
the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean
anything to you? Do you want to live
in a hotel where you press for the
hot water and cold water comes and
when you press for the cold water
nothing comes out at all? Phooey,
Buljanoff!"""|speech

terrible trouble."|speech

account of the safe. That's a perfect
excuse. There was no other safe big
enough."|speech

70|BULJANOFF AND IRANOFF|That's right. Good, very good.|speech
71||Suddenly Buljanoff grows skeptical again.|stage direction
72|BULJANOFF|"Of course, we could take out the
pieces and distribute them in three
or four boxes in the vault and take
a small room. That's an idea, isn't
it?"|speech

Iranoff comes to the rescue."|stage direction

have to have an idea?"|speech

The curtains are drawn and the lamp lighted. All four are
sitting around the table, in the center of which is a samovar.
In front of each of them is a glass of tea. One of the
Russians is playing a balalaika and all are singing gaily,
""Paris.""
Ninotchka is enjoying their companionship. After a little
while the door to the corridor opens and Ninotchka's other
roommate, the street-car conductor, strides in. She is a
squareset, unfriendly woman in uniform.
At sight of her one of the Russians nudges Ninotchka, makes
the gesture of ringing up a fare, and accompanies it with an
inquiring look. Ninotchka nods. The Russians change their
tune quickly to the ""Volga Boatman"" in order not to awaken
animosity.
The street-car conductor goes to her bed and starts to take
off her shoes and her coat, then draws the curtain. During
the following scene we hear the splash of water and the sound
