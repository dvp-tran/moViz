3||"THE MOJAVE DESERT - DUSK
Vast.    Barren.   No signs of life.
A BLOOD RED SUN is sinking behind the distant mountains.    The
unbearable heat will soon become an unbearable cold.
A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE.    Solemn.   Weary.   Determined."|stage direction
4||"WOMAN'S VOICE
When I was a little girl, my mother
would remind me each night before
bed to be sure to open my heart to
God, for he was kind, merciful and
just. Things changed after my
father left a few years later,
leaving her to raise me and my
brothers alone in a little place
out on the edge of the Mojave
Desert. She never talked about a
kind and merciful God again.
Instead she spoke of a prophecy.
Of a time when all the world would
be covered in darkness and the fate
of Mankind would be decided. One
night I finally got up the courage
to ask my mother why God had
changed, why was he mad at his
children. ""I don't know,"" she
said, tucking the covers around me,
""I guess he just got tired of all
the bullshit."""|unknown
5||"And with these words the last trace of sunlight is SNUFFED
OUT, leaving us in:
DARKNESS...
A darkness filled with the sounds of SIRENS, GLASS
SHATTERING, SPORADIC GUNFIRE...a CITY FALLING INTO CHAOS.
TITLE:   ""Los Angeles, December 23rd - 1:02 a.m.""
A BLOOD RED MOON
reflected in a greasy puddle of water. Might just be the
smog that's making it that ominous color. Then we notice
something moving in the reflection. A dark shape, growing,
coming down at us fast. Beat...then WHAM!
TWO BLACK BOOTS

7||EXT. AN ALLEY WAY - LATE NIGHT|location
8||"A DARK FIGURE in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the
pavement, hands out to slow the impact. A beat then slowly
he climbs to his feet, recovering from what seems to have
been quite a fall. He has chiseled features, shaved head,
deep-set eyes. Looks like he's been through one hell of a
fight.
His name, we will come to know, is MICHAEL.
He quickly checks out his surroundings, nothing but brick
walls above him. Where'd this guy jump from?
A RUMBLE of thunder...then RAIN starts to hammer down.   Seems
to motivate him.
Michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body and dashes
toward the mouth of the alley. He reaches the STREET just in
time to see a FLEET OF POLICE CARS tearing around the corner,
SIRENS WAILING, heading this way.
He reels back into the alley way, ducks down behind a trash
dumpster, as the BLUE AND RED LIGHTS of the POLICE CARS whip
past.
Michael waits for the lights to disappear, then he pulls a
MASSIVE ORNATE KNIFE from his jacket. Considers it grimly.
Runs his finger along its edge. Blood beads up. Razor
sharp.
Michael begins to peel off his overcoat, revealing his bare
chest underneath...and skin literally covered with DARK
TATOOS. Hard to see what they are in this light.
As his coat falls to the ground, we DRIFT over to the BRICK
WALL behind him where we see MICHAEL'S SHADOW crouch over,
and then...
...TWO LARGE SHAPES UNFOLD FROM HIS BACK, STRETCHING UP INTO
WHAT ARE UNMISTAKABLY...THE SHADOW OF WINGS.
The RAIN POUNDS harder, as if punishment from the heavens.
The glint of the KNIFE coming down fast.
A HORRENDOUS SOUND OF FLESH TEARING AWAY FROM BONE...
...THE BLOODY KNIFE CLATTERING TO THE PAVEMENT...
...FOLLOWED BY MICHAEL'S UNGODLY SCREAM RISING UP FROM THE
ALLEY WAY. And then SILENCE...
CLOSE ON THE GUTTER, AS BLOOD BEGINS TO FLOW FREELY, MIXING,
SWIRLING WITH THE RAIN..."|stage direction

15||"Michael bursts in. Tosses a first-aid kit into the sink.
His trench coat falls to the floor and here in the
fluorescent light, we get a better look at him.
His thin but stunningly well muscled body is TATTOOED
shoulder to ankle with INTRICATE WRITING. The man's flesh is
a living book. But the writing is in no language we
recognize.
He turns his back to the mirror, revealing two HORRIFICALLY
OPEN WOUNDS running down between both shoulder blades.
FRESH. BLOODY.
He threads a needle not with thread, but with FISHING WIRE,
and begins to STITCH the wounds closed. BLOOD POOLS on the
cement floor around his feet."|stage direction

17||"Trench coat and a shirt back on, Michael races along the
ENDLESS RACKS OF GUNS, searching for just the right weapons,
his every movement precise, as if he's trained his whole life
for this.
Weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags.
Whatever this guy's preparing for, it's big.
Rifle bags filled, Michael heads for the exit.   Stops cold.
The place is locked up tight.   Metal gate over the front
doors, bars over the windows.   How the hell's he going to get

Estevez rushes in to restrain Michael, grabbing his wrist,
FINGERS TIGHTENING. Michael closes his eyes, a terrible
decision made.
And that's when he moves, a fucking blur!
In an instant Michael's broken the cop's arm, spinning him
helplessly around, turning him into a human shield. Now it's
Michael who's in charge, gun to Estevez's head, facing off
with Burton.

confusion.
Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his WHOLE BODY
QUAKING, heels CLICKING the pavement, as if some massive
pressure were building inside him.
And with the horrific sound of CRACKING BONES, BURTON'S MOUTH
BEGINS TO TWIST INTO AN IMPOSSIBLY WIDE SMILE LIKE A BIZARRE
CLOWN!
His eyes SNAP OPEN, focused, the force inside him now fully
in control.
Burton looks at Michael with calm recognition, his voice
GUTTURAL..INHUMAN. A man possessed."|stage direction

eerie blue light of night's final moments. It looks like the
trailers haven't moved from this patch of barren ground in
decades. A single strand of colored Christmas lights dot the
trailers roof lines, marking the season.
One of the trailer doors CREAKS open and Jeep steps wearily
out into the cool western morning. Home.
Nothing but desert for miles in all directions, save for a
two lane HIGHWAY and a weather beaten TRUCK STOP DINER that
Jeep and his father will open for business in a few hours.
Jeep gazes up to the diner's slanted roof where a large sign
glows like a beacon in the darkness:

111||"BOB HANSEN (late 40's), owner and proprietor of this fine
roadside establishment, attempts to fix the old TV hanging in
the corner above the counter by banging the shit out it.
The restaurant itself has the kind of grungy diner charm
you'd hope to find in a place last renovated in 1963. An old
plastic Christmas tree strung with flickering lights and
tinsel occupies a lonely corner. Next to that, a faded
diorama of the NATIVITY SCENE. The kind you might order off
the Shopping Network.
Bob considers the TV with a frown. He deftly rolls an
ENGRAVED SILVER ZIPPO back and forth over the nicotine
stained fingers of his right hand. Must be a nervous habit.
You can tell just by looking at the man that he's a beer
drinker.
Behind the counter, a black man named PERCY WALKER (60's) is
cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one-handed
dexterity. You do get pretty good at this sort of thing when
your other hand has long been replaced by a METAL HOOK.   The
dog tags around his neck tell the story. His white cook's
hat has been temporarily replaced by a red Santa hat."|stage direction

MERLE HAGGARD tune ""I'M A LONESOME FUGITIVE"".
A stunning looking sixteen-year-old GIRL with dyed-black hair
and a piercing or three, is leaning seductively over the
jukebox, swaying gently to the music. The headband doubling
as her mini-skirt reveals her knock-out figure in a way that
really doesn't leave much up to the imagination. She's a
billboard of rebellion."|stage direction

the daytime we see this is truly a place time forgot.
Attached to the diner is a MECHANIC'S BAY. Grease stains and
rusty car parts litter the ground. Behind the place is the
SILVERSTREAM TRAILER we saw Jeep step out of earlier.
The only thing here that looks fairly new is the UHAUL TRUCK
parked in front of the garage with its hood up.

it's been broken for ten years.

GABRIEL ROCKETS UP IN FRONT OF THEM!
Charlie screams! Jeep pushes her and the baby out of the way
just as Gabriel comes down hard in front of them, kicking up
a cloud of dust.
Gabriel's mechanical wings haltingly retract. The crash has
done some serious damage. Much of his skin has burned away.
Chunks of his armor and flesh are missing as well, including
a large part of his head, revealing that under his human
visage is a NIGHTMARISH CREATURE.
Gabriel charges at Jeep fast. Jeep whips up his Glock, BLAM!
Gabriel takes the bullet, then slaps the gun out of Jeep's
hand.
Jeep throws a wild punch, connects with Gabriel's chin,
rocking him back. More annoyed than surprised, Gabriel
knocks Jeep savagely to the ground.
Jeep struggles quickly to his feet, comes right back at
Gabriel swinging. But Gabriel simply knocks him to the dirt
again.
Jeep slowly gets up once more, bleeding, hurt.   Raises his
fists. This kid will simply not give up.
Jeep moves in again, swinging hard, but Gabriel blocks it,
shoots out a hand and grabs Jeep by throat, lifting him clear
off the ground."|stage direction
