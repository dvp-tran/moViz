2||"FADE IN:
On complete darkness.
A SMALL DOOR swings open.
A circle of light reveals that we I re looking down the
length of a tube. At the far end of the tube, we see a
gloved hand dangling a rat. The hand shoves the
frightened rat into the tube and closes the door behind
it. The rat s stark white fur bristles and it begins to
pad down the tube s length.
After several feet, the tube opens up into a dimly lit
cubicle. The rat hesitates and stops.
The SOUNDS of gentle BREATHING whispers in the rat s
ears.
The rat turns round to head back down the tube, but a
door swings shut, trapping it in the cubicle.
The rat cowers as the BREATHING turns to SNORTING.
The rat s head jerks around, looking for signs of danger,
but the cubicle is empty. The rat sees a water dish on
the far side of the cubicle - a place to hide - and
dashes toward it.
But an invisible force descends.
The rat squeals in agony as something smashes down on its
body, crushing it.
A LOUD BELLOW rings out, and the rat flies into the air,
halting a few feet off the ground. Its body writhes,
struggling against the unholy force.
Then a sick crunch of tiny bones snapping. All life
quickly drains from the levitating body. Dead eyes...
The creature s corpse floats in mid-air. Then the white
fur of the rat explodes in a shower of blood.
HUGE BLOOD SMEARED INCISORS appear, as do the red-slicked
ape- like lips. The gaping bloody mouth bites again into
the rat.

Tonight Show. A small lamp and the glow from a computer
screen illuminates SEBASTIAN CAINE, late twenties with
the shabby good looks of a perpetual grad-student. Wiry
framed and wearing only boxer shorts, Sebastian sips
coffee from an  Einstein  coffee mug. He peers at a
complex computer rendered molecule displayed on his
screen. He pecks a few keys and the molecule shifts
slightly, then falls apart.
Sebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box, unwraps the
cellophane and sucks it down. He attacks the keyboard
with renewed vigor.
Another molecule appears on the screen. Sebastian s
fingers fly across the keyboard. The molecule blinks on
and off, it trembles and twists apart."|stage direction||

BRUNETTE, mid-twenties, absolutely stunning, enter her

it and then begins to undress. Sebastian loans over to
the window, getting interested. But when the brunette
reaches her bra and panties, she crosses to the window

Nothing happens.

WHAM! Something slams into Kramer and he tumbles, rolling
into the pool. But as he hits water there's not just one
splash, but TWO. In the water next to him is human shaped
AIR-POCKET. It's Sebastian displacing the water. And
because of the water displacement, we can clearly see two
arms pushing Kramer beneath the water's surface.
MARTHA KRAMER opens the bedroom window and looks down at
the pool. All she can see is her husband drowning... his
flailing limbs kicking up a massive air bubble around
him. She races from the window. Kramer kicks and flails
for a few moments and then his limbs stop moving. A
moment later he floats to surface, face down. The AIR
POCKET bobs over to the pool ladder, and rising from the
pool, we see Sebastian's body outlined in sheets of
water. The shape melts away in a cascading waterfall
until all we can see of Sebastian are the hundreds of
tiny droplets still clinging to his body, caught in the
light like twinkling bulbs on a Christmas tree. The shape
disappears into the darkness. A moment later Martha
emerges from the house and sees her husband floating face
down in the pool. She screams."|stage direction||

toward the door. Linda looks up to see his flaming body
fly over her, back into the corridor. Linda kills the

flickers and the security panel goes up in a shower of
sparks. The elevator dies. Linda pulls herself to her

she is. She looks around for him desperately. Nothing.
But something on the ceiling catches her attention. She
blasts it with the last jet of her dying torch. THE

Linda and slams her against the wall. His watery hand
