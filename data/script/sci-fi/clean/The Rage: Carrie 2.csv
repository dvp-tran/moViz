Perhaps even eerie.

a thick continuous stripe, until the paint thins out.
A WOMAN'S HAND plunges the BRUSH back into the paint can,
then takes up creating the stripe again, painting the wall:
until it reaches &pleated drape --
-- and doesn't stop. A window and another drape receive the
same treatment before the BRUSH is re-dipped.
A PUPPY,
a sad-eyed basset hound, sits on the floor watching, a bit
perplexed. This is WALTER and even he knows this is weird.
The dog looks over to...
A FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL
standing next to him, also watching. This is RACHEL. Dark
haired, in a plain dress. Her large eyes are welling on the
verge of tears.
The BRUSH is dragged across the wall, hits a wooden picture
frame, moves across a cheap oil painting of a pastoral,
forest scene, and over the other edge of the frame.
Another ANGLE takes in the red line, five feet high, parallel
to the floor, extending around a modest living room.
Painting the line is BARBARA LANG, in her thirties, yet worn,
haggard- She hasn't slept in a while.

the line runs across a wall and into a corner, is more than a
little frightening."|speech|unknown|?|

and a notebook. An all-night study session.
His hair is shor., he's wearing a beard. His face is more
mature, sadder. The beard largely hides some burn scars on
one side of his face.
Over the desk is a MIRROR and a ""Fighting Irish"" pennant.
The only light comes from his desk lamp.
He jerks awake with a spasm, glances at a digital clock
glowing on his desk: 11:S$ A.M."|speech|ARNIE|F|True

WALTER, Rachel's dog, hops on his lap, licks at.his face.
The sad-eyed DOG whimpers'and,JESSE scratches him.
In the distance the CLOCK TOWER BELL can be heard CHIMING
MIDNIGHT: One, two...
As JESSE looks down and his eyes widen in surprise:
Somehow, he's scrawled on the notebook paper on the desk in
front of him:
kINg of HELL
Or, if you only look at the capitalized letters, it reads:
Around it, the same phrase is written over and over again:
kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL
kINg of HELL kINg of HELL kINg of HELL
kINg of HELL kINg of HELL

resumes his cram session.
On the floor, the DOG looks at the open French doors, then
scurries under the bed.
