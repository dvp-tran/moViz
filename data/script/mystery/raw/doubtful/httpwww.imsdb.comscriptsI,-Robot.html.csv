covered in sweat.
PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying in bed. Sheets, tangled around
his legs. Alarm clock, playing something relentlessly
cheerful.
Spooner slaps it off. Sits up. Wincing. Bends his RIGHT
ARM. Stiff. He reaches for a BOTTLE OF PILLS. Shakes out a
couple and swallows them. Trying to forget. That dream.
You are in danger...
He rubs his hands over his face. Gets out of bed. His
apartment, basic. Unremarkable. Bearing the signs of
someone who lives alone. Shades drawn. A little messy."|unknown

elevated trains. Elbow to elbow. A river of humanity.
Spooner moves along, like everyone else. Suddenly. His
shoulders tense. That feeling at the back of his neck. He
turns and sees...
A ROBOT. Just behind him. Humanoid in design, but still
obviously a machine. Metal and synthetic casings covering
hydraulic muscles. The thing senses his stare. Looks up
with a muted WHIR...
ROBOT
(metallic voice)
Good day, sir...
Spooner. Speeds up his pace.     Weaving through the crowd to
lose the robot.
We now realise this is THE FUTURE. Towering apartment
buildings block the sun. The street packed with traffic.
PEDESTRIANS wearing their computers like form-fitting
portable offices. Spooner throws a look at his surroundings:
Up high an INDUSTRIAL ROBOT rolls down the side of a building
cleaning windows.
A WORK CREW of oddly-shaped RUBE GOLDBERG ROBOTS efficiently
repairs the street. No human supervision.
A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW. Lumbering along the sidewalk.
Scrubbing, sweeping. Emptying trash...
Humanoid ROBOTS dotting the crowd. Following their owners.
Walking slowly, deliberately. Carrying boxes. Groceries.
Briefcases.
Stamped on all the ROBOTS' SIDES, a LOGO:   III LAWS SAFE.
Spooner stops to wait at a light with other PEDESTRIANS.
Directly in front of him, a LITTLE GIRL clutches her father's
neck. She smiles big at Spooner. Front teeth missing.
LITTLE GIRL
Hi.
3.
SPOONER
Hi.
But it's not her father. It's her ROBOT CARETAKER.    The
robot turns. Looks at the girl.
ROBOT
You are not allowed to talk to
strangers.
Spooner, disgusted.   Has had enough.   He steps off the curb
Just as...
THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL swivels around.   Training its large
digital EYE on him:
TRAFFIC LIGHT
Please return to the sidewalk.
Spooner dodges several cars on his way across the street.
TRAFFIC LIGHT
Please return to the sidewalk...
The traffic signal, tracking him.
TRAFFIC LIGHT
You are in violation of city

Spooner throws up his hand. Flipping it the bird just as
SNAP! It takes his picture.

SPOONER
A device that called the police.
CALVIN
The sound of the gunshot would've
triggered a 911.
SPOONER
But the call came directly to me.

We're talking about a mechanism
designed by Hogenmiller to say
provocative things. To irritate

I get the whole ""mad scientist""
thing. Hogenmiller was past his

enters a room. Locks the door and
is found minutes later with a

his brain. Everything about this
case says suicide.

You don't sound convinced."|unknown

Appears before him...
Breathing. Getting heavier. He looks down at his hand.

Shakes out a couple PILLS. Swallows them. Staring down. At

SMASHING him against the wall. It's the Suspect. Spooner.
Sinks to the ground. As the Suspect Robot. Slips off the

Right now. But looks. Into Spooner's eyes...
Then turns.   Disappearing.
Spooner. Stunned for a second. Then. Rallies. Scrambles
to his feet and plunges back into the maze of bodies. Hears
a POUNDING. In the distance. Catches a glimpse. Of the
