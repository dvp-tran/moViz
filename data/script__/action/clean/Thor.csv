1|Ashley Miller & Zack Stentz|"FADE IN:
On the blackness of SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn
with a billion stars.
Atop a building, a wrought-iron sign -- a HAMMER-WIELDING
BLACKSMITH -- spins listlessly in the wind as a swirling
breeze kicks up. A hint of what's to come.
1 EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - NIGHT 1
A main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set
amid endless flat, arid scrubland. A large SUV slowly moves
down the street and heads out of town.
2 EXT. SUV - NIGHT 2
The SUV sits parked in the desert. Suddenly, the roof panels
of the SUV FOLD OPEN. The underside of the panels house a
variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point
at the sky.
JANE FOSTER (late 20's) pops her head through the roof. She
positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor calibrates with the
constellations above. It appears to be cobbled together from
spare parts of other devices."|speech|Ashley Miller & Zack Stentz|?
2|JANE|"Hurry!
We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below.
Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG (60) who emerges as
well, rubbing his head.
JANE (CONT'D)
Oh-- watch your head."|speech|JANE|F
3|SELVIG|"Thanks. So what's this ""anomaly""ù
of yours supposed to look like?"|speech|SELVIG|M
4|JANE|"It's a little different each time.
Once it looked like, I don't know,
melted stars, pooling in a corner
of the sky. But last week it was a
rolling rainbow ribbon--"|speech|JANE|F
5|"SELVIG
(GENTLY TEASING)"|"""Racing ""òround Orion?""ù I've always
said you should have been a poet.
Jane reigns in her excitement. She tries for dignity.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 1A."|speech|SELVIG|M
6|JANE|"Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and
my gloves, will you?
Intern DARCY LEWIS (20) hands Jane a bottle of Champagne and
a pair of gloves through the window. Jane passes it to
Selvig to hold while she pulls on the old gloves -- too large
and masculine for her small hands. He starts to unwrap the
foil, and she stops his hand with an excited grin.
JANE (CONT'D)
Not until you see it!"|speech|JANE|F
7|SELVIG|"(re: the gloves)
I recognize those. Think how proud
he'd be to see you now.
Jane's grin fades to a sad smile."|speech|SELVIG|M
8|JANE|Thank you.|speech|JANE|F
9|SELVIG|For what?|speech|SELVIG|M
10|JANE|"The benefit of the doubt.
The two stare out at the sky expectantly. A long beat while
they scan the skies. Nothing. Jane's worried.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2.
JANE (CONT'D)
It's never taken this long before.
Darcy calls up from the front seat.
DARCY (O.S.)
Can I turn on the radio?"|speech|JANE|F
11|JANE|"(an edge to her voice)
Sure, if you like rocking out to
KFRM, ""All agriculture, all the
time.""ù
Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle.
3 INT. SUV - NIGHT 3
The SUV is bathed in the glow of high-tech monitoring
equipment and laptops, some looking like they're held
together with duct tape. Jane opens a well-worn NOTEBOOK of
handwritten notes and calculations. Selvig watches the
frustrated Jane with sympathy."|speech|JANE|F
12|JANE|"The anomalies are always
precipitated by geomagnetic storms.
She shows him a complicated CHART she's drawn in the book,
tracking occurrences and patterns.
JANE (CONT'D)
The last seventeen occurrences have
been predictable to the minute... I
just don't understand.
Something catches Darcy's eye out the driver's side mirror.
She adjusts it. In the distance, ODD GLOWING CLOUDS form in
the skies over the Northeastern end of the desert."|speech|JANE|F
13|DARCY|"Jane?
Jane SHUSHES her, leafs through her notes. The bottle of
champagne begins to vibrate."|speech|DARCY|F
14|JANE|"There's got to be some new
variable... Or an equipment
malfunction...
The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around
them. The computer monitors SQUELCH with static.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 2A."|speech|JANE|F
15|DARCY|"I don't think there's anything
wrong with your equipment...
The champagne bottle starts to RATTLE noisily now as it
shakes more violently. Jane and Selvig notice.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3.
They watch it curiously, pressure building up inside it, when
the cork EXPLODES out of it. Champagne goes spewing
everywhere -- over equipment, over Jane.
DARCY (CONT'D)
Jane?"|speech|DARCY|F
16|JANE|What?!|speech|JANE|F
17|DARCY|"I think you want to see this.
Darcy points out the window. Jane and Selvig look out. Over
the desert --
MASSIVE CLOUDS OF RAINBOW LIGHT
Churn in the sky. The three stare, dumbfounded."|speech|DARCY|F
18|JANE|Holy. Shatner.|speech|JANE|F
19|SELVIG|"That's your ""subtle""ù aurora?!"|speech|SELVIG|M
20|JANE|"No-- yes! Let's go!
4 EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 4
The roof panels still open, the SUV races towards the strange
event, Jane, amazed by the sight, stands with half her body
out the roof, taking video of the light storm before them.
The SUV hits a bump. Jane nearly flies out. Selvig grabs
her, yanks her back in.
5 INT. SUV 5
Jane grins, thrilled, pumped with adrenaline."|speech|JANE|F
21|JANE|"Isn't this great?!
A thought strikes her.
JANE (CONT'D)
You're seeing it too, right? I'm
not crazy?"|speech|JANE|F
22|SELVIG|"That's debateable. Put your seat
belt on!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3A.
The SUV lurches.
6 EXT. DESERT 6
Winds HOWL around the SUV now. Up ahead, spiraling down from
out of the clouds comes --
AN ENORMOUS TORNADO
Suffuse with the strange rainbow light, ROARING like a
thousand freight trains as it touches down."|speech|SELVIG|M
23||4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 4.|stage direction||
24|SELVIG|"7 INT. SUV 7
Selvig looks up through the still-open sunroof at the
enormous glowing funnel cloud with wonder. Jane clambers
into the front seat, beside Darcy. She leans way out the
window, TAPING the storm."|speech|SELVIG|M
25|JANE|"You've gotta get us closer so I can
take a magnetic reading.
Darcy laughs."|speech|JANE|F
26|DARCY|"Yeah, right! Good one!
(then, realizing)
Oh God, you're serious..."|speech|DARCY|F
27|JANE|"You want those college credits or
not?
8 EXT. SUV 8
The SUV tears across a field towards the tornado, Jane
leaning out the window, taping the event. The SUV disturbs
two RAVENS perched on a cactus as they race past. The birds
take flight, when -- KRAKABOOM! A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING
strikes down through the center of the funnel cloud before
them with a terrifying intensity.
9 INT. SUV 9
The SUV rocks from the blast. Darcy's had enough. She turns
the wheel, starts to head away."|speech|JANE|F
28|DARCY|"Keep the credits. I'll intern at
Burger King."|speech|DARCY|F
29|JANE|What are you doing?!|speech|JANE|F
30|DARCY|"Saving our lives!
Jane grabs the wheel, jerks it hard the other way. They
struggle for control, when the headlights fall on --"|speech|DARCY|F
31|A MAN|"4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5.
Directly in their path, stumbling through the winds. Darcy
slams on the brakes, Jane turns the wheel hard to avoid him.
The SUV swerves -- but too late.
10 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 10
The side of the SUV slams into the man with a THUD, sending
him flying. The car SKIDS to a stop.
11 INT. SUV 11
Jane, Darcy, and Selvig trade shocked looks, breathing hard.
They peer through the dust clouds, unable to see through.
A paralyzed moment, then they all leap out of the car.
12 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 12
The three race from the SUV with flashlights. Jane spots the
man lying on the ground. He's dressed in tattered clothing,
charred and blackened."|speech|A MAN|M
32|DARCY|"I think that was legally your
fault."|speech|DARCY|F
33|JANE|"Get the first aid kit.
Darcy heads back inside the SUV as Jane, concerned, kneels
next to the man. Selvig hovers, protectively.
She gently turns his head to the light, and we see him
clearly for the first time. He is magnificently handsome,
long blonde hair flowing around his classically sculpted
features. She cups her hands around his face, as if willing
the life back into him.
JANE (CONT'D)
Come on, big guy. Do me a favor
and don't be dead, okay? Open your
eyes and look at me.
Suddenly, he GROANS, and she's startled, then relieved, as
his eyes flutter open. She looks deep into his confused,
azure eyes, which at last focus on her own. Locking onto
them.
For a moment, they each forget to breathe.
The connection is broken as Darcy returns with the kit. She
freezes when she sees how gorgeous the man is.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 5A."|speech|JANE|F
34|DARCY|"Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I
know CPR.
A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her heels.
She looks up at Selvig. Back to being a scientist."|speech|DARCY|F
35|"JANE
HIS EYES--
DARCY
(DREAMILY)"|--are beautiful.|speech|JANEHIS EYES--DARCY|?
36|JANE|"--are dilating. That's a good
sign."|speech|JANE|F
37|SELVIG|"We still have to get him to a
hospital."|speech|SELVIG|M
38|"JANE
(HOPEFULLY)"|"After we get a reading on the
storm?"|speech|JANE|F
39|SELVIG|"Immediately, Jane.
Jane sighs and nods, regretfully watching the storm EVAPORATE
above their heads. A thought strikes her."|speech|SELVIG|M
40|JANE|"Where did he come from?
They exchange puzzled looks, as we move up through the last
glowing remnants of the storm, and into:
13 EXT. SPACE 13
EARTH spins slowly before us as we hear a voice, deep and
resonant -- the voice of HEIMDALL, Gatekeeper of Asgard.
HEIMDALL (V.O.)
Questions, they've always asked
questions -- this race called man,
on this planet they call earth.
Passionately longing to know how
they are connected to the heavens.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 6.
We pull away from the planet, widening, past other worlds,
cosmic debris -- leaving first our solar system, then our
galaxy.
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
In ages past, they looked to us as
gods, for indeed so many times we
saved them from calamity. We tried
to show them how their world was
but one of the Nine Realms of the
Cosmos, linked to all others by the
branches of Yggdrasil...
We pull back until we see it -- YGGDRASIL. Immense,
sprawling, like a quasar or a nebula twisted into the vague
shape of a TREE, its branches of glowing energy stretching
out into the black void of space.
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
...the Worlds Tree. Nine Realms in
a universe of wonder, beauty, and
terror that they barely
comprehended.
We move in through Yggdrasil, until we reach what looks like
a galaxy, slowly spinning before us.
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
But for all their thirst for
knowledge, they let our lessons
fall into myth and dreams.
Where did he come from? He came
from us, the proudest race of
warriors the Worlds have ever seen.
He came from this -- the greatest
Realm the universe has ever known.
We move through the galaxy's mists and astral matter, then
over and up, through a band of prismatic color to reveal
what's on the other side:
HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
He came... from Asgard!
14 EXT. ASGARD - DAY 14
Beautiful beyond imagination. We fly over the magnificent
landscape of the Realm, through the gleaming capital city,
modern yet timeless."|speech|JANE|F

42|JANE|"15 EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 15
The palace rises countless stories tall, gleaming with an
other-worldly majesty, towering high above the Realm sprawled
out before it.
We move towards a large window of the palace, where a FIGURE"|speech|JANE|F
43|STANDS --|4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 7.|speech|STANDS --|?
44|ODIN ALLFATHER|"Stares out at his kingdom. The ravens fly up to the balcony,
land at his side.
16 INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 16
Odin turns away from the window. His wife FRIGGA sits at a
vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror."|speech|ODIN ALLFATHER|?
45|ODIN|Do you think he's ready?|speech|ODIN|M
46|FRIGGA|"He thinks he is. He has his
father's confidence."|speech|FRIGGA|F
47|ODIN|He'll need his father's wisdom.|speech|ODIN|M
48|FRIGGA|"And his humility?
Odin reacts.
FRIGGA (CONT'D)
Thor won't be alone. Loki will be
at his side to give him counsel.
Have faith in your sons."|speech|FRIGGA|F
49|ODIN|"Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He
could be a great King...
Odin stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It seems to be out of
synch temporally with the rest of the world, leaving a trail
as it moves. He stares at it determinedly, concentrating,
trying to stop the strange event through the force of his
sheer will.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8.
Finally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more.
A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own.
ODIN (CONT'D)"|speech|ODIN|M
50|(QUIETLY)|...if we only had more time.|speech||
51|FRIGGA|"For once, our son needs something
we cannot provide."|speech|FRIGGA|F
52|ODIN|I can fight it a little longer...|speech|ODIN|M
53|FRIGGA|"No. You've put it off too long! I
worry for you.
He touches her cheek."|speech|FRIGGA|F
54|ODIN|"I've destroyed demons and monsters,
devastated whole worlds, laid waste
to mighty kingdoms, and still you
worry for me?"|speech|ODIN|M
55|FRIGGA|Always.|speech|FRIGGA|F
56|ODIN|"Not today. Now come kiss your
king... while I'm still king.
He pulls her close, and they kiss.
17 INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 17
Directly under the throne room, a gloomily lit hall. Banners
hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of the
fire lit room.
Giant doors open at one end. A huge figure silhouetted
against the bright light beyond walks forward. In slo-mo, we
recognize the unmistakable shape of the God of Thunder.
Hammer in hand, he reaches the end of a raised platform.
An ATTENDANT hands the figure a goblet of wine.
He downs it quickly, hurls it towards the fire directly
below."|speech|ODIN|M
57|THOR|"Another!
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8A.
The cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow
intensely -- and, for a moment, brightly lit, and seen full
length, like a King to be, is THE MIGHTY THOR.
He proceeds down stops, past camera, and down the center of
the Hall.
We follow from behind and see at the other end, massively
shadowed on one of the great banners, the shape of two great
horns. As Thor approaches, the horn shapes move, and then,
from the shadows at the side, emerges LOKI, wearing his
horned headpiece.
Like Thor, he is dressed for a great ceremony. They stand by
a brazier at the foot of steps that lead up to the crowded
throne room."|speech|THOR|M
58|"LOKI
(TO THOR)"|"Nervous, brother?
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9."|speech|LOKI|M
59|THOR|"Have you ever known me to be
nervous?"|speech|THOR|M
60|LOKI|There was the time in Nornheim...|speech|LOKI|M
61|THOR|"That wasn't nerves, brother. It
was the rage of battle. How else
could I have fought my way through
a hundred warriors and pulled us
out alive?
The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for
Thor."|speech|THOR|M
62|LOKI|"As I recall, I was the one who
veiled us in smoke to ease our
escape."|speech|LOKI|M
63|THOR|"Some do battle, others just do
tricks.
The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like
it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand.
EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and
across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the
goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles.
THOR (CONT'D)
Loki...
Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn
back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered.
THOR (CONT'D)
Now that was just a waste of good
wine."|speech|THOR|M
64|LOKI|"Just a bit of fun.
(to the Attendant)
Right, my friend?
The Attendant isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE-WINGED
HELMET.
LOKI (CONT'D)
(re: Thor's helmet)
Nice feathers.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9A."|speech|LOKI|M
65|THOR|"You don't really want to start this
again, do you, Cow?"|speech|THOR|M
66|LOKI|I was being sincere!|speech|LOKI|M
67|THOR|You're incapable of sincerity.|speech|THOR|M
68|LOKI|"Am I?
He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost.
LOKI (CONT'D)
I've looked forward to this day as
long as you have. You're my
brother and my friend. Sometimes
I'm envious, but never doubt that I
love you.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 10.
Thor searches his brother's face, sees no trace of irony.
He's either speaking from his heart or he's a very, very good
liar. Maybe both. Thor puts an appreciative hand on his
brother's shoulder."|speech|LOKI|M
69|THOR|"Thank you.
The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:"|speech|THOR|M
70|LOKI|Give us a kiss.|speech|LOKI|M
71|THOR|"Stop.
Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.
THOR (CONT'D)
How do I look?"|speech|THOR|M
72|LOKI|"Like a king.
They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.
LOKI (CONT'D)
It's time."|speech|LOKI|M
73|THOR|"You go ahead.
Loki casts him a wary look.
THOR (CONT'D)
I'll be along. Go on.
Loki heads inside the palace without his brother.
17A INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 17A
VOLSTAGG combs his great beard in preparation for the big
event. As he does, he's surprised to find a stray GRAPE
stuck in the beard. He pulls it out, looks around, then
eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down.
FANDRAL checks his reflection in a mirror, smooths out his
moustache, gives himself a dashing smile. A PRETTY MAIDEN
holds the mirror before him, as other MAIDENS look on
dreamily."|speech|THOR|M
74|FANDRAL|"Thank you, love.

76|FANDRAL (CONT'D)|"Now who'd like to polish my sword
for me?
The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands.
HOGUN stands staring ahead grimly, his hands folded in front
of him, amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and
the ceremony preparations going on around him. A HELPFUL
ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor.
Hogun turns his head, gives him a look. Intimidated, the
Attendant quickly backs away.
From behind, we see a WOMAN IN CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her
SWORD and set it on a table, then her SHIELD, then several
HIDDEN DAGGERS and small, yet intimidating WEAPONS. We
reveal that it's SIF, looking radiant. She eyes the weapons
on the table."|speech|FANDRAL|M
77|SIF|"(to the weapons)
I'll miss you.
18 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 18
Colorful CEREMONIAL BANNERS of the Nine Realms adorn the
room, crowded with AESIR and REPRESENTATIVES from across
Yggdrasil, all BUZZING with excitement.
Thor's COMRADES enter and stride to their place of honor at
the front of the hall. They are:
THE WARRIORS THREE
VOLSTAGG has the girth and strength of a Sumo wrestler, with
oversized passions to match. FANDRAL, the consummate
swashbuckler, is agile, charismatic, and nattily dressed.
HOGUN -- dark, sullen, brooding -- a large MACE slung at his
side.
With them walks the warrior maiden SIF. She's clad in armor,
a shield and sword at her side -- a beauty not to be trifled
with.

The others laugh, save Hogun. Fandral turns to him.

it. Even you, Hogun the Grim.
Just one smile.
Hogun stares at him grimly.

teeth."|speech|FANDRAL|M

Sif and the Warriors Three still wait before the crowd. Loki

hall alongside the others. With another blast of the horn,
the crowd goes silent as the EINHERJAR HONOR GUARD moves into
formation. They part to reveal --"|speech|FRIGGA|F
94|ODIN|"4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12A.
Sitting atop his throne, clad in full ceremonial armor. He
holds his spear GUNGNIR before him. Any trace of weakness in
him is gone now. He exudes all the power and majesty of a
Ruler of Asgard.
Frigga joins him at his side. He looks around the hall,
casts a glance over to the Warriors. Thor is nowhere to be
seen. Odin looks to Loki. Loki shrugs. Odin isn't pleased.
A murmur spreads through the crowd."|speech|ODIN|M

102|SIF|"Oh, please.
Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display.
21 INT. VAULT - DAY 21
As the sound of the cheers echo from above, the odd, cold
breeze picks up in the Vault. The Guards rub their limbs to
warm themselves. They grow increasingly uneasy, sensing
something's not right.
They exchange a look, then walk the length of the Vault's
hallway to its end, where a CASKET sits undisturbed upon a
pedestal.
LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them. They look up and
SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons.
22 INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 22
Thor finishes stirring up the crowd, then reaches the front
of the room, kneels on one knee before his mother and father.
Frigga casts him an admonishing glance. Thor winks up at
her. She can't help but smile.
Odin strikes Gungnir upon the ground with a deafening BOOM.
The crowd falls silent. Odin speaks with quiet, effortless
authority.
He raises Gungnir before him."|speech|SIF|M

catch glimpses of them in the shadows -- but they are large
and BLUE-SKINNED.
One of the creatures lifts the Casket off its stand and turns
to go. But, as they do, the intricate latticework behind the
Casket starts to separate and retract, revealing something
standing in the shadows behind it.
As the creatures walk away, a fiery glow rises behind them.
They turn back around.
Now it's their turn to SCREAM.

virtues to which we must aspire.

their limbs for warmth in the increasingly cold air of the

Thor and his band of adventurers, on horseback, pass through
the massive Gate, leaving Asgard behind. They ride along the
most astounding path in this Realm or any other --
THE RAINBOW BRIDGE.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 21.
Wide and flat, it runs straight out from Odin's palace to the
mists and black void of space beyond. In the distance far
ahead, the Bridge continues on until it reaches Heimdall's
Observatory.
29 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 29
The band draws near the Observatory, where HEIMDALL himself,
Gatekeeper of Asgard, stands at his post on the Bridge before
them, blocking their way, staring them down.
There is something other-worldly about him, even for this
Realm. He holds a massive sword in front of him, his stern,
intimidating face virtually concealed by armor. Something
glints beneath his visor, like twinkling stars."|speech|VOLSTAGG|M

The Bifrost energy quickens along the Bridge, feeding into
the Observatory.

Heimdall turns his sword in the control panel. The
Observatory's giant turret swings around, aims toward a
section of space. As a final step, Heimdall plunges his
sword deeper into the control panel. The great turret FIRES,
the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it.

The others join him at his side, then step towards the
Bifrost. Their bodies stretch towards the maelstrom,
changing shape, as if every atom of their being is being
elongated by the pull of it. In an instant, they're jerked
off the platform and inside the vortex.
33 EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 33
A hole in the sky rips open, and the Bifrost comes shooting
out of it. Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits, as Thor
and his band touch down. RUNES from the Bifrost are
imprinted on the ice around them.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 24.
Volstagg loses his footing, falling backwards. Thor quickly
grabs him by the belt. We see the warrior dangling

ice and, tremendously relieved, he proclaims:"|speech|THOR|M

lucky belt! I will never remove
it! Even when bathing!"|speech|VOLSTAGG|M
214|FANDRAL|"You bathe?
Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder
at the frozen alien wasteland before them. The whole planet
is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking
apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges
and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks

draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor.
Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them."|speech|LOKI|M
256|VOLSTAGG|"Silly hammer! Has a mind of its

263|HOGUN|"Shut up!
Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks
loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle.
A Jotun backs Hogun up against a wall of ice. As the Giant
hurls an ice blade fist at him, the grim warrior swings his
mace over his head, embedding it into the ice wall, and
hoists himself up, dodging the Giant's blow and leaping over
him. Hogun takes out a second approaching Frost Giant, spins
back, dodges a swing from the first, then pounds the Jotun
with his mace.
Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another with her
double-bladed staff. One knocks her viciously to the ground."|speech|HOGUN|M
264|SIF|"If you don't treat me like a lady,
I won't act like a lady!
She takes out the Jotun.
Loki backs away from an approaching Jotun, finds himself at
the edge of a deep crevasse. The Giant sees he's vulnerable,
swipes at him. But the Jotun's arm passes right through him.
The Giant stands there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI comes
out from behind a structure and shoves the Giant into the
crevasse below. The false Loki dissipates into nothingness."|speech|SIF|M
265|LOKI|"(to the falling Giant)
Pathetic.
He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from
either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at
once.
Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE.
The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then
punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet. It's a
long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in
front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back.
Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns."|speech|LOKI|M
266|THOR|"Come on! At least make it a
challenge for me!
He sees the Brute coming at him. The huge Jotun lands a
tremendous blow, sending Thor back across the ice. Thor
rises, grins.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28B.
THOR (CONT'D)
Now that's more like it!
He throws Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the Brute
head over heels.
Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows in mid-air, then flies
back to his grasp.
THOR (CONT'D)
(re: the fallen Brute)
Ugly and stupid.
Sif takes out a couple Frost Giants, but she's knocked to the
ground by another. It raises its weapon above her.
Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls a HIDDEN KNIFE from his
sleeve and hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting him square in
the chest. The Jotun falls dead."|speech|THOR|M
267|SIF|"(to Hogun, re: knife)
I'm so glad I taught him how to do
that!
Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good
hits in."|speech|SIF|M
268|VOLSTAGG|"You may want to put some ice on

The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in
a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind.
Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
You may be taller, but I'm wider!
Volstagg launches his mighty belly at the Jotun and sends him
flying.
Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and
sending him crashing to the ground.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
It's not too late for you to
surrender.
Volstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's
bare arm. The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the
Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing
Volstagg's flesh. The warrior SHOUTS in pain.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28C.
Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's
ice helmet and dropping him to the ground.
Winded, he takes a seat upon one of the fallen Jotun's bodies
to catch his breath. As the battle rages around him, he
opens a secret compartment at the end of his weapon, takes
out a small FLASK.
Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin. He yells
to his comrades.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
Don't let them grab hold of you!
He takes a swig, enjoying the brief respite, then rejoins the
battle.
Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword
stops mid ice layer.
The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow to Volstagg's face,
and the warrior drops to one knee.
Sif sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him. In one
quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using
her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's
chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the ground.
VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
(on his belly)
Thank you, my lady. But I nearly
had him!"|speech|VOLSTAGG|M
269|SIF|"Of course you did.
Nearby, a Frost Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE BULLETS, hurling
them at Sif. Sif raises her shield barely in time, as the
bullets go pinging and ricocheting off it. She races into
the group of Frost Giants who attacked her and takes them
out.

Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around
Hogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly
worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously
close to hacking into Hogun's legs."|speech|VOLSTAGG|M

Fandral sword fights with a Frost Giant."|speech|VOLSTAGG|M
273|FANDRAL|"You really think your icicles are a

Fandral lunges at the Giant. The Jotun knocks his blade
away.
FANDRAL (CONT'D)
Fair enough.
Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's
sword and snaps it in half.
FANDRAL (CONT'D)
Could we stop just a moment while I
get another sword?
Fandral fights the Giant with his broken sword. The Jotun
then lunges at Fandral, who ducks just in time, grabs hold of
the Giant's sword and redirects it, stabbing the Giant
through with his own weapon.
The Jotun staggers back, then reaches down and swipes at a
pool of water, sending up a spray that freezes in mid-air,
forming into an ICE STALAGMITE. It impales Fandral,
rendering him helpless.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 29A.
Loki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and
felling Frost Giants as he goes. He reaches the nearly-
unconscious warrior, when other Jotuns approach. He fights
them off.

278|VOLSTAGG|"Flawless.
Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice
stalagmite.
Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one of the Frost
Giants.
The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved wrists. Loki pulls his
hands free of the gloves, which are still in the Giant's
grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. The wounded Jotun sees
his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare arm.
Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But instead
of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm turns BLUE
-- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness spreads
painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused.
The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the
unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the
distraction, KICKS the Giant.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 30.
Thor continues fighting, his blood lust rising. He taunts
the Jotuns around him."|speech|VOLSTAGG|M
279|THOR|"Come on!
But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost
Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor
from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon.
Mjolnir falls to the ground.
A Frost Giant desperately struggles to lift Mjolnir off the
ground, to no avail.
Now free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg
slings him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to
leave.
From his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides
it's time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the
palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the
wall of the palace, and down to the ground below.

the face, then flies into Thor's outstretched hand. Thor
raises the hammer up high, and brings it down on the ground
with all his might.
KRAKABOOM! Lightning strikes down from the sky, the hammer
channeling the blast, firing the electricity out at the
Jotuns around him. They're blasted back in a massive
shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, drop dead to the ground.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 32.
But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the
shockwave continuing to spread outwards. It moves out to

As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their

quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them.
The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes
a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not
move, for fear of falling through, into the void below.
Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He
raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off

Laufey slams his fists into the ground, and the ice beneath

react, thinking it's an attack, but Laufey just stands face-

He walks over to it slowly, reaches out to it, lifts it
between his forearms off its pedestal. As he does, a
blueness spreads from his arms, across his body.

interest. The Librarian stops mid-story and calls to the Kid
pleasantly.

Joshua, come sit down. It's story
time.
The Kid closes his book and joins the others. Selvig looks
over, notices the title of the book the Kid was reading --
""MYTHS AND LEGENDS FROM AROUND THE WORLD.""ù
He picks it up, flips through it, stops at the section on
Scandinavian Mythology.
It's a picture of a RAINBOW BRIDGE coming down from Asgard to
earth. ASGARDIANS walk upon it, among them ODIN, LOKI, and
THOR, who wields Mjolnir. On the ground below them, a group
of VIKINGS kneel reverently.

barricades. Armed GUARDS man a gate in the razor wire fence
that runs fifty yards from the crater's edge, enclosing the

Clear, plastic access tubes with junction boxes lead to a
translucent cube structure erected in the middle of the
crater.
Through the glass walls of the base's command trailer, we see
Coulson directing TECHNICIANS, busy at work.
Within the cube structure itself, a team of SHIELD SCIENTISTS
work with high-tech machinery, analyzing the object at the
center of it all -- Mjolnir.

A SHIELD GUARD moves through the base, rifle in hand. From
the shadows behind a trailer, a FIGURE looks out at him.
As the Guard raises his radio to check in, Thor quickly
rushes towards him and chokes him out. He falls to the
ground.
Thor notices the AR-15 rifle lying on the ground beside the
fallen Guard. He stares down at the weapon quizzically. As
more GUARDS approach, Thor snatches up the weapon and takes
cover in the shadows of the trailer. The Guards pass by.
Thor peers around the corner, sees the well-guarded main
entrance tube to the center of the site.
A bright light suddenly illuminates his face. He looks to
see an ATV moving across the site, shining its spotlight
right on him.
Thor sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him. The Driver
raises his radio to report. Thor knows he has to act fact.
He raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and
catches it by the barrel. He rears the weapon back, then
hurls it like a hammer. It flies through the air, smashing
the ATV's spotlight.
Glass and debris shower the driver, who takes his hands off
the wheel to protect himself.
The ATV roars out of control past the Guards near the tube
entrance. The Guards notice and chase after it.
Thor emerges from the shadows, watches the Guards abandoning
the site entrance.
80A EXT. EDGE OF CRATER 80A
The ATV Driver looks forward in panic as the ATV approaches
the crater lip.
The vehicle careens over the edge of the crater and heads
straight for one of the plastic tunnels. The Technicians
inside scatter as the ATV CRASHES into it, tearing into the
tunnel, sending sparks everywhere.
The ATV finally comes to a stop, the tunnel collapsing around
it and the Driver. SHIELD AGENTS rush in behind to help."|speech|JANE|F

Thor knocks out the first Guard, then tackles the second. He
hurries around the corner, when more GUARDS come up a ladder
ahead. Thor punches the closest Guard, sending him tumbling
backwards, toppling the others on the ladder behind him.
Thor takes off running, as the Guards regroup and give chase.
Thor spots the glow of Mjolnir in the central cube, through

whipping his feet in front of him, then kicks out, nailing
the Huge Agent in the chest. The Agent goes down hard as
Thor's momentum carries him past.
Thor stands, heads for the cube structure, when the Huge

But the creature stirs with life, its fire igniting once

Slowly, unnaturally, the Destroyer spins its torso around 180
degrees to face its attackers.
The Destroyer unleashes a blast at Sif. She barely dives off
of the behemoth in time, dodging the blast. The Destroyer
rises again to its full height, pulling free from Sif's
staff, the weapon slipping through the slats of its armor.
Sif and the Warriors Three try to regroup, when the Destroyer

Destroyer.
Thor jams his hammer deep into the Destroyer's faceplate.

Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a tremendous
heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished forever.
Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away from its

992|JANE|"157 INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 157
Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires Gungnir, sending
Thor sliding across the floor and knocking Mjolnir from his
hand.
The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim.
Thor raises his hand towards his hammer, tries to summon it
back to him, to keep it in this Realm, but the Bifrost is too
powerful.
Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor himself slides
towards the Bifrost."|speech|JANE|F
993|LOKI|"If you care so much for the Jotuns,
then die with them.
The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to
drag him away. He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he
concentrates, mustering his will. He reaches out his hand
towards the Bifrost.
MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand.
The hammer pulls him free. Loki tries to fire off another
blast at him, but Thor takes to the air, speeds towards his
brother.
158 EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 158
Thor and Loki come CRASHING through the Observatory dome and
land hard, rolling across the Rainbow Bridge. As Thor gets
to his feet, he sees Loki dangling off the Bridge's edge."|speech|LOKI|M
994|LOKI|"Thor! Help me!
Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking
up at him desperately.
LOKI (CONT'D)
Please...
Loki's fingers start to slip. Thor reaches down to grab his
brother's wrist, but his hand passes through Loki's. Just
then, the REAL LOKI materializes behind him. Thor whirls
around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir.
Loki lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls
him across the bridge.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 110.
Thor, bleeding, rises to his knees. Loki strides up behind
him to finish him off, when Thor swing his hammer around.
It passes through him. Instantly, another Loki appears next
to him, Thor swings his hammer, but that too is an illusion.
Loki after Loki appears, Thor futilely swinging at each one,
never making contact. Thor falls back to his knees. The
Lokis grin as their raises their spears, encircling him."|speech|LOKI|M
995|LOKIS|I was always more clever than you.|speech|LOKIS|M
996|THOR|"Yet still not clever enough.
With that, Thor raises his hammer, rising into the air,
summoning lightning. A massive bolt strikes Mjolnir, then
channels outwards, splitting up, striking each one of the
Lokis.
All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real
Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir
knocked from his grasp.
Thor steps over to his fallen brother, lying dazed on his
back. Loki winces, prepares for the worst, when Thor steps
away.
Loki opens his eyes, tries to stand, but can't. He looks
confused, then sees what the problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop
his chest. Struggle as he may, Loki can't lift it off. He's
pinned to the ground.
Thor looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing
towards Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of
energy moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to
do.
Loki watches him smugly."|speech|THOR|M
997|LOKI|"Look at you, the Mighty Thor.
With all your strength, what good
does it do you now?
Thor knows Loki's right. He's powerless to stop what's
happening. He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet,
VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy
feeding into the Observatory. Then he gets an idea.
He realizes what he must do -- and what he must sacrifice.
Thor extends his hand towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. The
hammer goes flying to his grasp. Loki looks confused.
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 111.
Thor raises Mjolnir in the air. Clouds form above him,
thunder RUMBLING. Lightning arcs off of his hammer, as he
channels the power of the storm into it, then --
He strikes Mjolnir down upon the Rainbow Bridge. The blow is
massive, causing a rumbling along the whole bridge, shaking
the Observatory itself like an earthquake. A crack appears
where the blow struck. Loki rises to his feet.
LOKI (CONT'D)
Stop! What are you doing?!
Thor lifts the hammer again, brings it down harder. BOOM!
The crack grows bigger. The Bifrost energy starts to stream
out from it. Loki thinks fast.
LOKI (CONT'D)
If you destroy the Bridge, you'll
never see her again!
Loki grabs Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to pierce Thor
through the back."|speech|LOKI|M
998|THOR|"Forgive me.
Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises
Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all
sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow --
KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING
out of it.
Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the force of
the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward along the
Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart as it goes.
The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART.
As Loki and Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of
Gungnir, while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall
towards the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out
from the broken Bridge.
They're an instant from being blasted by the destructive
force of the energy, carried away by the current, pulverized
by the debris, when --
A POWERFUL HAND
Catches Thor's leg. Thor dangles there, holding onto Gungnir
as Loki hangs onto the other end. Loki looks up, shocked to"|speech|THOR|M

1000|ODIN ALLFATHER|"Standing on the edge of the broken Bridge, awakened from the
Odinsleep, restored to his full strength.
Loki searches his father's face, looking for some kind of
approval, some kind of redemption, but all he sees is
disappointment and regret.
Loki lets go.
THOR (CONT'D)
No!
But it's too late. Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki
falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy. It carries
him away, along with the debris of the Bridge and the
Observatory, disappearing out of sight.
Odin pulls Thor up onto the Bridge. Drained, Thor falls back
into his father's arms."|speech|ODIN ALLFATHER|?
1001|ODIN|"It is over.
159 BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 159
The Bifrost energy explodes in the sky like fireworks firing
in all directions.
Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson stand watching in amazement.
Jane looks back up at the sky, distraught. She knows the
significance of what's just happened."|speech|ODIN|M
1002|JANE|"It's gone.
160 INT. ODIN'S PALACE - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT 160
A FEAST is in progress as Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three
sit amongst the gathered Asgardians. Hogun sits between
Fandral and Volstagg, who is in the middle of recounting
their battle with the Destroyer."|speech|JANE|F

1004|FANDRAL|"Is that another way of saying you
fell on your huge a--"|speech|FANDRAL|M
1005|VOLSTAGG|"As a matter of fact, falling down
was a tactic. Lulling the
Destroyer into a false sense of
security!"|speech|VOLSTAGG|M
1006|FANDRAL|"Well, I was the one who had to drag
your enormous carcass off the
battlefield. That makes me the
real hero. Doesn't it, Hogun?
Hogun points to Volstagg."|speech|FANDRAL|M
1007|HOGUN|"Big stomach.

Big mouth.
The other gathered Asgardians laugh. Volstagg and Fandral
look to Hogun. The grim warrior gives just a trace of a
smile."|speech|HOGUN|M
1008|FANDRAL|"Well, how about that? A smile!
I'd say that calls for another
drink!
They laugh and raise another round.
Frigga sits nearby, lost in thought, her face betraying the
sadness she struggles to conceal. Sif notices, approaches
Frigga, bows her head."|speech|FANDRAL|M
1009|SIF|"My Queen. I am so sorry for your
loss.
Frigga takes Sif's hand appreciatively."|speech|SIF|M
1010|FRIGGA|"Thank you, Sif.
She looks to Thor, who's unable to enjoy the merriment around
him.
FRIGGA (CONT'D)
How is he?

1011|SIF|"He mourns for his brother. And he
misses her. The mortal.
Frigga sees the trace of regret in Sif's face as she looks at
Thor with new feelings. He rises and leaves the hall."|speech|SIF|M
1012|FRIGGA|"He will need his friends now more
than ever."|speech|FRIGGA|F
1013|SIF|"I will always be at his side.
Frigga understands, puts her arm around Sif gratefully.
161 EXT. PALACE BALCONY - NIGHT 161
Thor stands alone on the balcony, lost in thought. Odin
walks up behind him."|speech|SIF|M

Odin leaves, Thor consoled by his words.
162 EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - NIGHT 162
Out of the broken, jagged Rainbow Bridge flows the Bifrost
energy, drifting off into space.
Thor walks out to its edge, where Heimdall stands watch.
Thor stares out at the stellar void.

163 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - NIGHT 163
Through the window into Jane's lab, we see an enlarged
ILLUSTRATION from her notebook pinned to a board. As we pull
away, we see a computer terminal displaying a program clearly
inspired by the illustration. We pull further back to see
that the lab has been transformed into a well-funded research
facility, abuzz with activity.
SHIELD SCIENTISTS and AGENTS work with impressive, state-of-
the-art equipment.
Selvig orchestrates the process, giving instructions to the
SCIENTISTS. We continue to track right outside the glass
windows and rise up to find Jane sitting at the front of the
roof, working at a small, improvised workstation, notebook at
hand, as always. She sets up an impressive, HIGH-TECH DEVICE
before her, which bears the ""STARK INDUSTRIES""ù logo.
From behind, Darcy approaches, hands her a flash drive."|speech|THOR|M
