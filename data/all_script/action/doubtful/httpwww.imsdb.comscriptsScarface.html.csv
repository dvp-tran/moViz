""Enjoy yourself -- every   day   above    ground

ANONYMOUS,    MIAMI    1981
1       A PROLOGUE                                                     1
crawls up the screen -- with Narrator.
NARRATOR
In May 1900, Fidel Castro -- in an
effort to normalize relations with
the Carter Administration -- opened
the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the
apparent intention of letting some
of his people join their relatives
in the United States. Within seventy-
two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed
for Cuba.   In the next few weeks, it
became evident that Castro was forcing
the boat owners to carry back with
them not only their relatives but the
dregs of his jail population. 3y the
time the port was closed 125,000
'Marielitos' had landed in Florida.
An estimated 25,000 had criminal
records.   This is the story of that
minority -- those they call 'Los
Bandidos.'
The prologue is shredded diagonally by the blade of a
stilleto and in the empty black void we:

._        a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in,
trying     still      to        contact    somebody      --    anybody    --   on    the   outside.
Tony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone
number written in pencil on the back of a snapshot-   As he
finishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see
a young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,
standing together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in
shadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with
handling.   Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone
rings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have
not yet seen in Tony.
Someone     picks      up        the     phone. An older woman's Voice.                    His
expression         alters         to     uncertainty.
VOICE
Yes? ..Hello?..Who                is this?
Tony changes his mind, hangs up.  Pause. The faces of those
in line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony
ignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his
pants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.
He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive.                                 Then recognizes
somebody     in       another          phone     booth   and     goes    over.
Angel Frenandez has got the face of one, as he argues on
the phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a
worn phone book in his hand.

a big distribution set-up here to
Houston and Tucson....
Their point    of    view -- Ronnie Echevarria, powerful, competent-
looking man    in    conversation with a party of people.
LOPEZ
That guy there, in the purple shirt --
Gaspar  Gomez. Bad news.   Stone killer
there ever was one.   Stay away.
Their point of view -- Gaspar             Gomez at a table with another
guy and gorgeous woman.
LOPEZ
...the     fat guy,    with the chicas is
Nacho      Contreras   -- El Gordo. Wouldn't
know     it to look     at him but he's got
more     cash than     anybody in here. A
real      haza....
Their point of view -- El Gordo is fat, dressed like a cheap
slob and playing up to a bunch of chicas.
LOPEZ
. ..you    know what a haza is, Tony?
TONY
'Haza'?    No   Frank, what's     a    haza?
LOPEZ
It's Yiddish for pig.   It's a guy he's
got more'n what he needs, so he don't
fly straight anymore, y'know. That's
the problem in this business, Tony,
there's too many 'hazas' and they're
the ones you got to watch out for.   If
they can fuck you outta an extra dime,
they'll rip you and flip you and then
fuck you with a stick for the pure
pleasure of it. See it all comes down
to one thing, Tony boy, never forget
it!   Lesson number one -- don't under-
estimate the other guy's greed.
ELVIRA
Lesson number two -- don't            get    high
on your own supply.

Alejandro Sosa is a playboy, about six-foot-two, black wavy

casual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin Klein.
On his wrist is a flashy gold ID bracelet with ""Alex'
written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex
with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000. His
eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the
continual excitement of his toys and his money.
Accompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense
venomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the
look of death in an unsmiling face.   He is always in
proximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person
or persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte
position, his eyes swivelling to stare down the person who
might glance at him. He is a continual source of tension
underplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar

a near collision with an insane bus driver and has to brake
suddenly, angling into a deep pothole, shaking the car and
honking angrily after the bus.

out at him. One of them garrotting the Marielito. He
struggles.

the interior of the guard shack. They knife the other

A    third   monitor.    carries     another   image   of    shadows   moving

On the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almost

As he crosses into his office, the                           camera moves to      reveal
Gina standing there half-dressed in                          the     doorway,   her eyes
blazing with hatred.
Tony     sees   her.
She steps         forward, offering her body almost naked to her
brother.
GINA
Is     this    what       you want      Tony?...
Tony     shocked.
GINA
You can't stand another man                         touching
me.  So you want me Tony, is                        that it?
Well here I am 0-T
She    fires    the    Baretta       we    now   see    in    her    hand.
The bullet grazes Tony in the leg, snapping him from his
catatonia   as he goes reeling across the floor behind his
desk.    She fires again.  Again.
GINA
I'm all        yours       Tony,       I'm all yours
now.
Bullets ripping into the desk.   She advances, offering
her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic
intervals.
GINA
Come and get me Tony.                   Before       it's
too     late.
He spins across the run away from the desk, trying to put
distance between them.  She sees him scurrying,. turns, an
expression like a demented angel.
GINA
Come on Tony, fuck           me!       Fuck       me!
Fuck me!
Advancing on him, firing. The furniture tearing up, the chair
spilling, television sets and computer toys shattering, Tony
squirming away, hit again in the thigh, shocked, scrambling
over to the terrace windows.   Her next shot shatters the
window and as Tony ducks again to the side, we see outside
onto the terrace behind him:

1290||"A young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of the
hitters -- is crouched there, reacting to the broken window.
He  doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.
Gina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the
room, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor.
Tony sees it, yells something, in the same instant
swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.
The punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and
Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls
him over the balustrade.
The punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds
at the base of the balcony.
Tony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and
empties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the
pool below.
Ernie runs into view on the far side of the pool, spots                  (X"|stage direction

We catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull,
moving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly
underneath the balcony on which Tony stands.
Tony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back
into his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.
It takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels,
looking questioningly in her face."|stage direction
