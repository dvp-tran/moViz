as we pull out that we realize it's the engine of a car. Over
the image we hear a voice talking on a phone.
DRIVER O/S

routes marked in pencil. The voice continues -
DRIVER O/S
...One last thing. You won't be able to
reach me at this number again...
DRIVER hangs up the phone. He folds his map of LA and slips it
in his duffel bag. A few clothes and other essentials are neatly
packed inside. He zips the bag shut and takes one last look at a
cheap TV set. On screen, a movie is playing. On a radio, the LA
Clippers are taking a pounding from the New York Knicks."|speech

bag. A YOUNG COUPLE emerge from their car after a late night
out. Driver lowers his eyes, avoiding their gaze as he makes his
way towards a sleek 1970's Chevelle"|speech
7||4 INT/EXT. DRIVER'S CAR/ ALVARADO - NIGHT. 4|stage direction
8|unknown|"The Clippers-Knicks game plays on the car radio now. Driver is
only half listening, focused on the road. We see his face in the
passing neon lights. Feline good looks. Impassive blue eyes.
Something almost melancholy in his unwavering gaze. He drives
carefully, letting other cars overtake."|speech

elevator. Hurrying out in the opposite direction he sees a

9/24/10"|"Driver heads down the hallway and unlocks the door to his new
apartment. It's not all that different from his last one. Clean,
sparse, and anonymous. He doesn't even bother to walk in. He
tosses his duffel bag inside and locks the door again."|speech

9/24/10"|"Driver's back on the road, the basketball game still playing on
the radio. He drives past a row of brightly lit Mexican food
shacks on Silver Lake Boulevard and turns into a run down garage

vintage cars."|speech

follows him past rows of vintage cars."|speech

with a hundred and sixty horsepower inside.
You get any sleep?"|speech

As Shannon grins we feel the familiarity between them."|speech

They head past more cars -- Fords, Dodges, Buicks -- until they
arrive at a plain looking Impala."|speech

Driver's behind the wheel of the Impala now, cruising past rows
of dingy toy stores on 3rd Street. He glances at his watch. It's

9/24/10"|"A vast electronics superstore dominates the deserted street.
Under the pale yellow glow of the street lamps, Driver sees
signs advertising a `huge blow out weekend sale'. He pulls over,
making sure he has a good view of the entrance. On the radio,
the basketball commentator is getting more excited."|speech
28|BASKETBALL COMMENTARY|"...This is some comeback from the Clippers!
Only a few minutes ago they looked dead and
buried!...
Driver reaches under the seat and pulls out a small handheld
scanner. He switches it on, tuning it to the right frequency.
Crackling police dispatches are interspersed with the basketball
commentary now."|speech
29|POLICE SCANNER|"...9 Adam 81, what is your current
location?...Repeat, what is your current
location?..."|speech
30|BASKETBALL COMMENTARY|"...Another unbelievable three pointer from
Davis and the Clippers are within five!...
Out of the corner of his eye Driver sees two MEN approach. He
doesn't react, expecting them. They cut through the fence with
bolt cutters and approach the main building. Driver watches them
pull on their masks, then one of them takes out a shotgun and
blasts the lock to the front door. Instantly the alarm shrills.
The only thing Driver does is to turn on his stop watch."|speech
31|BASKETBALL COMMENTARY|"...Time out Knicks...
The stop watching keeps ticking away, the siren blaring, the
commentary continuing, the police scanner crackling.
The storefront is hidden in shadow, impossible to tell what's
going on inside. Driver looks at his stop watch. Almost three
minutes. One of the masked men emerges now, carrying a duffel
bag. He hurries over and gets in the back of Driver's car
without a word. There's no sign of the other robber."|speech

9/24/10"|"The commentary continues, so does the crackling on the police
scanner. Four minutes. Still no sign of the second armed robber.
His companion in the back starts to look nervous, wondering
what's happened to his partner.
Driver doesn't betray a hint of nerves. Four and half minutes on
his stop watch. Thirty seconds more and he's on his way.
Suddenly the second robber appears from the shadows, running as
fast as he can to the getaway car. He jumps into the back seat a
few seconds short of five minutes and Driver screeches off."|speech

9/24/10"|"Driver thunders over the 1st Street bridge towards Boyle
Heights, then eases his foot off the gas, slowing to a steady
speed. In the back seat the two armed robbers rip off their
masks, looking pumped up with adrenalin. Driver studies them in
his rear view mirror, then swerves right on Mission Street as
his police scanner crackles to life."|speech
36|POLICE SCANNER|"...Attention all units...211...Superstore
on Traction Avenue...Suspects headed
Eastbound on 1st Street...Driving a Silver
Impala...
Driver swings sharply into 4th Street now, crossing the L.A.
River again, heading back in the same direction he came."|speech
37|POLICE SCANNER|"...Airships dispatched...Downtown and Boyle
Heights...All units standby. Repeat, all
units standby...
Up ahead, the lights of Downtown L.A. glitter against the night
sky. Hovering between the neon green glow of the skyscrapers
Driver sees the red and white glint of a police helicopter. He
switches off his headlights, turning left on Santa Fe Avenue."|speech

39|POLICE SCANNER|"The armed robbers watch in tense silence as Driver weaves in and
out of the industrial alleyways with his lights switched off.
It's as if he's trying to find his way out of the maze or
probing to see if there's anyone out there."|speech
40|POLICE SCANNER|"...1 Baker 11, headed south on Boyle
Avenue...No sign of suspects...Repeat, no
sign of suspects...
The armed robbers look relieved when suddenly a police car
glides past at the end of the alleyway, its lights also off."|speech

9/24/10"|"It's like catching a glimpse of a passing shark's fin. Driver
taps the brakes gently, his car sliding to a stop. He stays
there a moment, then eases the Impala forward, turning in the
same direction as the black-and-white."|speech

9/24/10"|"It's a high-risk strategy but Driver follows the black-and-white
at a distance, hidden in the darkness, knowing other squad cars
won't be checking the same route. The police car makes its way
through the dimly lit industrial zone, unaware it's being
shadowed. Driver turns his car radio up a whisper."|speech
45|BASKETBALL COMMENTARY|"...And for the first time in the game the
Clippers have the lead. 71 to 69. Seven to
go in the Fourth here at the Staples
Centre...
Driver turns the sound back down. Up ahead, the police car
swings left, disappearing from view. Driver slows down too,
anticipating the next obstacle. He doesn't have long to wait. In
the distance he suddenly sees the piercing beam of a police
chopper's search-lights, sweeping the area one more time.
Driver floors the gas, speeding straight towards the approaching
helicopter. The armed robbers are too stunned to protest. They
just sit there, watching the sweeping searchlights getting
closer and closer.
Then suddenly it becomes clear what Driver's doing. Up ahead,
there's a small underpass below the 7th Street bridge. Driver
slides the car under the safety of the bridge just before the
chopper's searchlights spot them."|speech
46||15 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ UNDERPASS/ LA RIVER INDUSTRIAL AREA - NIGHT.15|stage direction
47|BASKETBALL COMMENTARY|"The roar of the helicopter thunders overhead. The underpass is
crammed with dirty mattresses and shopping carts. Sleeping HOBOS
can be seen under dirty blankets. Driver waits for the echo of
the helicopter to fade, then moves forward again."|speech
48||16 INT/EXT. IMPALA/ OLYMPIC BOULEVARD/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 16|stage direction
49|BASKETBALL COMMENTARY|"Gloomy yellow street-lamps shine down on the industrial zone.
Rows of delivery trucks are parked outside the meat-packing
factories. Driver cruises cautiously down the deserted street.
The crackling of the police scanner and the droning of the
basketball commentary add to the tension. Finally up ahead he
sees car-lights streaming back and forth on Broadway."|speech

9/24/10"|"There's a steady flow of traffic on Broadway. Driver falls in
behind the other cars. On the radio, the basketball game is
still playing."|speech
55|BASKETBALL COMMENTARY|"...Three thirteen left on the clock.
Dunleavy calls a time out and it's the
Clippers by one...
The passing head-lamps light up Driver's face. There's not a
trace of emotion in his eyes -- even when he spots a patrol car
approaching in the opposite direction."|speech
56|BASKETBALL COMMENTARY|"...Buckle up your seat belts Clippers fans.
This game really is too close to call...
The two cars pass each other slowly. Driver sees the cops in the
Black-and-White peering at the Impala as they head past. He
turns down the basketball game and focuses on the scanner."|speech
57|POLICE SCANNER|"...This is 1 David 16...Silver Impala
headed South on Broadway and
Pico...Couldn't get a look at her license
plates...Appears to be only one occupant...
In the back seat, the armed robbers wait nervously for the
police dispatch to respond."|speech
58|POLICE SCANNER|"...1 David 16...why don't you check her
out...
As soon as he hears this Driver swerves sharply into the next
street."|speech
59||18 INT/ EXT. IMPALA/ SIDESTREET OFF BROADWAY/ DOWNTOWN - NIGHT. 18|stage direction
60|POLICE SCANNER|Driver guns around the block now, building up speed.|speech

9/24/10"|"Driver bursts out onto Pico now. A squad car headed in the
opposite direction slows down as it sees him but is caught up in
the flow of traffic, unable to turn round and give chase."|speech
64|POLICE SCANNER|"...1 David 11...suspect headed West on
Pico...
Driver threads his way through the vehicles in front of him, so
smooth and effortless it's hard to tell how fast he's going. He
glances up as he hears the dull rumble of a police chopper
overhead. The helicopter is almost directly above him, swinging
its search-beam back and forth to get a lock on his position.
Driver pushes the car as fast as it will go, but there's no way
of outrunning the chopper. Blue light floods the asphalt around
him as he guns down Figueroa."|speech
65|POLICE SCANNER|"All units...pursuit in progress...silver
Impala...Headed North on Figueroa...
Even now Driver doesn't panic, turning his attention back to the
basketball game."|speech
66|BASKETBALL COMMENTARY|"Thornton pulls up from behind the arc,
misses. Rebound New York. One eighteen to

Driver swerves sharply towards the sparkling lights of the
Staples Centre."|speech

barrier says `Season Ticket Holders Only'. Driver punches in a
ticket and roars into the parking lot."|speech

70|BASKETBALL COMMENTARY|"The Impala screeches from one level to the next. With a game
going on, the parking lot is almost full. Finally Driver pulls
into a free parking space."|speech
71|BASKETBALL COMMENTARY|"...Thirty seconds remaining and all the
Knicks have to do is run out the clock...
Driver glances in his side mirror. Behind him, dozens of FANS
are already streaming out into the parking lot before the game
is over, hoping to avoid the inevitable traffic."|speech
72||21 CONTINUED: 21|location
73|BASKETBALL COMMENTARY|"...Gordon back to Davis...Davis for
three...This is unbelievable!...
The jubilant commentary continues, but Driver isn't listening
anymore. The game has served its purpose. More fans flood into
the parking lot. Dozens of cars pull out of their places."|speech
74|BASKETBALL COMMENTARY|"...What a remarkable comeback...Outplayed
for most of the game, the Clippers have
shown incredible resilience...
Driver glances at the armed robbers and nods. It's time. They
climb out of the car, merging in with the crowd. Driver watches
them disappear, then slips on a Clippers cap, climbs out of the
Impala himself and heads towards another car."|speech
75||22 EXT. STAPLES CENTRE/ DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT. 22|stage direction
76|BASKETBALL COMMENTARY|"Outside the parking lot, the police are waiting, stopping
anything that looks like an Impala, shining their flashlights
into the windows. Wearing his Clippers cap and a Clippers
sticker on his new car, Driver calmly drives past them, making
his getaway."|speech

PULL OUT we see to our surprise that he's wearing a policeman's
uniform. It's only as we pull out further that we see several
other `POLICE OFFICERS' sitting in the same fold up chairs,
reading car magazines and scripts as they're powdered by MAKE-UP
GIRLS, and realize we're on a movie set.
Driver glances up from his script and sees another STUNTMAN
being fitted with an SFX mask. The stuntman now looks identical
to the STAR of the movie who stands nearby.
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR O/S
I need you guys to sign this contract...
Driver takes the form along with all the other stuntmen and
signs it without a glance."|speech

cars on the hood of a cop car to demonstrate the danger."|speech

fender any faster than fifty not only will

Driver heads off, disinterested in the negotiations."|speech

least a thousand five."|speech

2ND UNIT DIRECTOR O/S
Camera ready, sound ready...
Shannon joins the rest of the crew, looking on.
2ND UNIT DIRECTOR O/S
...ACTION!...
Driver floors the gas, screeching out of the alleyway. He
swerves between several oil drums then straightens up on the
main road.
In his rear view mirror he sees a black Dodge Charger appear on
cue, bearing down on him."|speech

Charger keeps coming at speed.
Driver's eyes stay fixed on his rear view mirror, judging the
other car's speed and angle of approach to perfection.
The Charger slams into the back of Driver's car at sixty miles
an hour, hitting him just above the left rear wheel.
Driver's reactions are quick as lightning, counter-steering as
his Black-and-White goes careening off the road. He keeps the
car upright long enough to slow it down before it finally flips
end over end.
Up ahead, the Charger skids to a showy stop.
2ND UNIT DIRECTOR O/S
...And CUT!...
Some clapping and cheering breaks out, but most the crew
couldn't care less, returning to their cell-phones and shot
lists. Only Shannon seems interested in Driver, limping over and
helping him out of his battered Black-and-White."|speech

Driver spits out some fake candyglass from the shattered
windscreen."|speech

Egg rolls, chicken chow mein, five flavor
shrimp and Peking duck."|speech
98|BERNIE ROSE|Did they remember the chop sticks?|speech
99|WAITER|"Doesn't look like it, sir. Let me run and
get the guy.
From the way the waiter hurries off we get a sense of Bernie's
power and authority. He turns back to Shannon, resuming their
conversation."|speech

101|BERNIE ROSE|"...You run a perfectly good business. Why
would you want to change now?"|speech
102|SHANNON|"You know how much my business made last
year? Thirty Grand. Takes me six months to
build a car and a couple of seconds for
these jerks to write it off on a stunt that
doesn't even make it into the movie.
Bernie shakes his head but clearly has a soft spot for Shannon."|speech
103|BERNIE ROSE|How much do you need?|speech
104|SHANNON|Let me talk you through it first.|speech
105|BERNIE ROSE|That sounds like a lot.|speech
106|SHANNON|"Doesn't have to be. The big money teams
burn through three, four million a year but
that's `cause they're using half a dozen
test drivers and a stable of cars."|speech
107|BERNIE ROSE|"I don't know anything about car racing but
I assume there's a reason for that?"|speech
108|SHANNON|"Sure, but it's not the only way. All I need
is a hard-used stock car. We start off with
the small-town action then work our way up.
There's close to two thousand events out
there and once we make the Show we're
talking millions."|speech
109|BERNIE ROSE|`Millions'?|speech
110|SHANNON|"There's a fortune to be made. Sponsorship.
TV deals. We'll even name the team after
you.

of this?"|speech

Bernie waits for the waiter to leave then continues."|speech

Shannon hesitates but only for a second."|speech
115|SHANNON|"Four hundred and thirty thousand dollars.
Bernie Rose can't help grinning at his nerve."|speech
116|SHANNON|"Look, I wouldn't come to you unless I was
sure about this."|speech
117|BERNIE ROSE|"Come on, Shannon. How can you be sure? What
have you got these big money teams don't
have?"|speech
118|SHANNON|I got a driver.|speech
119|BERNIE ROSE|"And they got half a dozen Drivers you told
me."|speech
120|SHANNON|"Not like this one.
He stares at his friend with quiet conviction."|speech
121|SHANNON|"I been working with this guy a long time -
I've never seen anything like it. I had the
money I'd back him myself...
Bernie Rose considers him quietly."|speech
122|BERNIE ROSE|But you don't have the money.|speech
123|SHANNON|"Everything I own is in metal. I had to sell
my Bullit car the other day just to pay the
gas bill. I'm telling you, Bernie, put this
kid behind a wheel there's nothing he can't
do."|speech

gets hit by a bus?
Shannon's about to reply when they're interrupted by a big bull
of a man with a gruff voice."|speech
126|NINO|"What are you doing eating Chink food in my
restaurant?"|speech
127|BERNIE ROSE|"What's a Jew doing running a Pizzeria?
Worst fucking pizza in LA by the way. How
hard is it to bake a loaf of bread?"|speech
128|NINO|"It's the fucking water in this city...
Shannon smiles, intimidated by Nino, giving up his seat
respectfully. Nino doesn't even acknowledge him."|speech

town anyway?"|speech
130|NINO|"Well, I'm back.
(Barely a glance at Shannon)
Take a hike. I need to talk to my partner."|speech
131|BERNIE ROSE|Be polite, Nino. I invited him here.|speech
132|NINO|"Oh, I'm sorry. How you doing, Shannon?
How's the fucking leg?
Bernie senses things are only going to get worse and dismisses
Shannon gently."|speech

across the flatland. Everything is silent, then slowly the hum
of an engine rises as the stock car turns towards us. It
shimmers in the heat waves, the noise of its engine getting
louder as it picks up speed.
Shannon stands with his friend Bernie Rose at the edge of the
makeshift track, staring at the glittering car with its colorful

parked vehicles. Driver drags Irene behind a car now, covering
her with his body as Tan Suit fires another burst.
More sparks light up the darkness, the bullets penetrating the
car with ease, narrowly missing Driver and Irene.
Driver moves again, dragging the terrified Irene behind him. Tan
Suit loses sight of them in the darkness, striding past rows of
parked cars."|speech

looks terrified -- not just of Tan Suit but of him. It's as if
all her worst fears have been confirmed.
Driver stares back at her, then hears Tan Suit's footsteps
approaching.
He holds her gaze apologetically, then gets to his feet and
runs, trying to draw Tan Suit's fire.
Tan Suit hears him and opens up again, more bullets lighting up
the darkness. Driver keeps moving. Tan Suit strides after him,
reloading, when suddenly his gun jams.
Crouching behind another vehicle, Driver sees this and takes his
chance, darting out after his pursuer. Tan Suit sees him coming
and runs, the hunter becoming the hunted now.
Still lying on the ground, Irene listens to their echoing
footsteps.
Driver runs after Tan Suit through the darkness, gaining all the
time. Tan Suit looks desperate now, tiring. He turns to face his
pursuer but Driver's on him in a flash, hurling him against a
car.
Tan Suit slams into the car, losing his balance. Driver grabs
him, swinging him around, smashing him into another car.
Irene's watching from the shadows, stunned by the violence. She
picks herself up and runs towards the elevator.
Driver keeps slamming Tan Suit against the car, beating the
resistance out of him. As his body begins to slump, Driver grabs
him by the throat and rams his head into a car window.
The glass splinters with blood, the force of the blow shattering
Tan Suit's skull.
Driver looks around for Irene now and sees her standing in the
elevator, framed against the light.
She stares back at him, but makes no attempt to step out.
Driver stands there, his hands covered in Tan Suit's blood. The
elevator doors finally close, hiding Irene from view."|speech

looks behind him and sees Driver calmly pursuing him. He keeps
running, but he's badly injured, slowing all the time. Fear
clouds reason and he staggers towards the crashing waves.
Driver slows down as he watches the gangster wade into the
ocean, a pathetic last attempt to evade him. The crashing waves
and the undertow are an impenetrable wall. Every time Nino tries
to wade out further, the ocean drags him back."|speech

and more feeble as the ocean exhausts him and snuffs out any
hope of escape. Finally he retreats back into the shallow water,
barely able to keep his footing. He turns around and faces
Driver, the crashing waves still smashing into his back.
They stay like that for a moment. Gazing at each other. Driver
silhouetted against the white sand. Nino trapped in the ocean.
Then Driver wades out into the water. Nino has no fight left in
him, staring at the masked man. Driver stares back at him then
grabs him by the throat, forcing his head under the water. Nino
splutters as Driver lets him up again."|speech

friend not me...

He's dead.

part of him has died. We feel the regret in his eyes but there's
no trace of emotion in his voice."|speech

himself a glass of wine. The mobster's dressed for the occasion,
wearing a jacket and tie. He smiles at Driver as he sits down."|speech
983|BERNIE ROSE|"Care for a glass?...
Driver doesn't smile, gazing back at him across the table.
Bernie Rose doesn't seem to care."|speech
984|BERNIE ROSE|"I can recommend the duck. Hell, I can
recommend everything -- Walnut prawns,
shredded beef, Velvet chicken -- but the
duck's to die for...

calling over a WAITRESS."|speech

conversation drifting over from the other tables."|speech

Question is where does that leave us?"|speech

Driver nods. Bernie Rose studies him quietly."|speech
995|BERNIE ROSE|"Tell me something, how does someone with no
interest in money get mixed up in a heist?
(Off his silence)
Shannon told me it was because of the girl?
Driver hesitates, betraying a hint of concern. Bernie sees it
and smiles."|speech

Just me..."|speech
997|(A BEAT)|You still see her?...|speech
998|DRIVER|She's not interested.|speech

two ex-wives, three kids, four
grandchildren. Not one of them speaks to me
now...
He smiles again, looking into Driver's eyes with just a hint of
sympathy."|speech

He grins, then holds out his hand for the gym bag."|speech

Driver reaches out to give him the bag, when suddenly Bernie's
hand snakes out of his pocket, twisting a switch-blade into
Driver's gut. He pulls it out, ready to stab again, but this
time Driver catches his wrist, slowly forcing the knife up to
his throat.
Their eyes are fixed on each other for a moment, with something
like regret, then the blade pierces Bernie Rose's neck, sinking
deeper and deeper. Driver holds the old man in his arms as he
dies. They stay like that, locked in a fatal embrace, then
Driver lowers Bernie Rose gently to the ground, out of sight.
Blood seeping through his shirt, Driver picks up the gym bag and
puts it back in the trunk, slamming the door shut."|speech
