what I was driving that day. I've
owned a lot of cars. Different
kinds. Lots of different kinds of
cars. She was standing, this girl,
on the side of the street where
there was a chicken stand; not the
Colonel, mind you, but nevertheless
a chicken stand, and I pulled the
Mercury over and rolled down the
window by electric power. She was
wearing a leather skirt and she had
a lot of hair on her arms. I like
that. I like it a lot. It means a
big bush. I like a big bush. She
said, ""Are you dating?"" I said,
""yes,"" and she got in the car. We
pulled to a remote location, one
that she and I both felt
comfortable with and she said, ""How
much can you spend?"" I said, ""What
it takes to see your bush. I know
it's a big one."" She said ""twenty
five dollars,"" which to a working
man is not chicken feed. I produced
the money and she put it in her
shoe and pulled up her skirt. There
before me lay a thin, crooked,
uncircumcised penis. You can
imagine how badly I wanted my
twenty-five dollars back."|speech

you?"|speech
24|MARSHA|Yes sir.|speech
25|WOOLRIDGE|"I think there must have been a
little mix up. I told your sponsor
or teacher or whatever he is, there
couldn't be any pictures. It's
s'posed to be just a little story

right?"|speech

newspaper. But it has pictures. I
mean it's a regular paper, you
know."|speech

filling station business and a good
filling station business. He was
one of those young men that we run
across so often in life. I'm sure
you've run across them, that didn't
deserve the things he had. One of
those things was his beautiful
bride, Sarah. She was a Georgia
Peach. As a matter of fact she
looked more like the picture I've
had in my head than any woman I've
ever seen. I took it upon myself to
take her away from John Liggit
Hunter, who didn't deserve her. I'm
not sure if I mentioned that he was
a Frenchman who claimed to be an
Englishman. It took some very
strong nylon cord to take her away
from him. She was a fighter as well
as a Georgia Peach."|speech

That I know of anyway. That's why I
said to send a man. At least maybe
he'd answer a question or two for a
man. I'm all for helping the
college out, believe me. It might
be a real good article or story."|speech

knew that sex was wrong and that
people who did it should be killed

that his mother knew what the Bible
said. And she made sure Karl knew.
You know he slept in a hole in the
ground under a toolshed, right?"|speech

their punishment. Hers and his
father's; from God, for having sex--"|speech

think. She told him... God gave
them the ugliest creation he could
think of. Karl has an entire book --
a notebook. On every page it says
""Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number
1."" He wrote that a few years ago
after he'd learned to write. His
father's name was Franklin."|speech

wanting to know is what I'm doing
in here. I reckon the reason I'm in

But I reckon what you was a wanting
to know is how come me to kill
somebody. Well, I reckon I'll start
at the front and tell you."|speech
102||(pause, heavy breathing)|location
103|KARL|"I lived most of my life out behind
my mother and father's house in a
little old shed and my daddy'd
built for me. They didn't too much
want me up there in the house with
the rest of 'em. I mostly just set
around out there in the shed all
the time a lookin' at the ground.
It didn't have no floor but I had
me a hole dug out to lay down in
and a quilt or tow that I put down
there."|speech

105|KARL|"My daddy was a hard workin' man
most of his life, not that I can
say the same fer myself. I most
just set around the shed and
tinkered around with a lawn mower
or two and went to school off and
on from time to time but the
children there made quite a bit of
sport of me, made fun of me quite a
bit. Some of 'em roughed me up
sometimes so mostly I stayed out
back there in the shed. My daddy
worked down at the sawmill there,
down there at the planer mill for
an old man named Dixon.
Old man Dixon was a very cruel
feller, he didn't treat his
employees very well, didn't pay 'em
much of a wage, didn't pay my daddy
much of a wage, just barely enough
to get by on. But I reckon he got
by all right, they come out one or
the other of 'em, usually my
mother, and fed me pretty regular.
At least I know he made enough for
me to have mustard and biscuits
three or four times a week. Old man
Dixon had a boy named Jesse Dixon.
Jesse was really more cruel than
his daddy. He made quite a bit of
sport of me and takened advantage
of the little girls around the
neighborhood quite a bit."|speech
106||(pause)|location
107|KARL|"He used to say my mother was a very
pretty woman. He said it quite a
bit from time to time, when I was
at the school house. Well, I reckon
you want me to get on and tell you
what happened so I reckon I'll tell
you. I was settin' out in the shed
one evenin' not doin' too much,
just kindly starin' at the wall and
a waitin' fer my mother to come out
and give me my Bible lesson and I
heared a commotion up in the house
there so I got up and run up on the
screened-in porch there to see what
was a goin' on, and I looked in the
kitchen window and I seen my mother
a layin' there on the floor without
any clothes on."|speech
108||(pause, breathing)|location
109|KARL|"And seen Jesse Dixon a layin' on
top of her having his way with her."|speech
110||(pause)|location
111|KARL|"Well, I just seen red. I picked up
a kaiser blade that was a layin'
there by the screen door, some
folks calls it a sling blade, I
call it a kaiser blade. It's just a
long handle like a axe handle with
a long blade on it that's shaped
kind of like a banana. Sharp on one
edge and dull on the other. It's
what the highway boys use to cut
down weeds and whatnot.
I went in the kitchen there and I
hit Jesse Dixon up side the head
with it and knocked him off my
mother. I reckon that didn't quite
satisfy me so I hit him again in
the neck with the sharp edge and
just plumb near cut his head off.
Killed him. Well, my mother, she
jumped up from there and started
yellin', ""What did you kill Jesse
fer? What did you kill Jesse fer?"""|speech
112||(pause, intense breathing)|location
113|KARL|"Well, come to find out my mother
didn't really mind what Jesse was a
doin' to her. I reckon that made me
madder than what Jesse had made me.
I takened the kaiser blade, some
folks calls it a sling blade, I
call it a kaiser blade and hit my
mother up side the head with it an'
killed her."|speech
114||(long pause, breathing)|location
115|KARL|"Some folks has asked me if I had it
to do over again would I do the
same thing. I don't know, I reckon
I would. Anyhow, they seen fit to
put me in here and here I've been
for a great long while. I've
learned to read some; took me four
years to read the Bible. I reckon I
understand a good deal of it. It
wasn't what I expected in a lot of
places. I've slept in a good bed
for a great long while. They've
seen fit to put me out now. They
tell me they're a settin' me free
today. Anyhow, I reckon that's all
you need to know. If you want any
more details I reckon I can tell
'em to you. I don't know if that's
enough for your newspaper or not."|speech

I'm rambling. If you're going to
live in the Wheatly garage you need
to know that it won't be easy.
Doyle is a monster. Not just a
closed minded redneck, but a
monster. A dangerous person. I've
told Linda that one day that man is
going to really hurt her or that
boy. Maybe even kill one of them. I
see it in his eyes. I'm very in
tune, maybe even psychic. Doyle
will make your life hell. You're a
perfect target. When I first saw
you I was afraid of you. Not really
afraid, I guess, just taken aback.
But also, I felt a real sensitive
feeling from you. And for some
reason, Frank has adopted you. Much
like a stray animal. I'm sorry, I
didn't mean it like that. In a good
way. Anyway, I just want you to
know what you're in for. I have a
good feeling about you. You're good
for Frank. Maybe it's that he can
have an adult friend on a child's

bad way."|speech

tried suicide, maybe you did

see before me is a gentle, simple
man. All I want you to promise me

You would never hurt them under any

me on those particular points, but
it's not really important in the

doing away with license plates
He stands alone anyway
Baking the cookies of discontent
By the heat of a laundrymat vent
Leaving his soul""
