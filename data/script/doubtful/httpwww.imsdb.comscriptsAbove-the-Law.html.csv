4||"PHOTOGRAPHIC STILLS show us NICOLA TOSCANI as a city boy in
various growing-up SHOTS, circa 1950's -- with street chums
wearing a Wyatt Earp T-shirt, in a communion suit. Then:
in his first qi, a youngster studying the martial arts; he
grows, we see news clippings of him winning trophies, his
name on contest posters, SHOTS of him in action. Then:
Japan. Nico now in his teens, studying with real masters,
being dumped on his butt, posing smiling beside Japanese
martial artists, then himself as an instructor. Now: a
few military uniforms enter the picture, we see security
clearance documents with Nico's picture and name on them.
Then Nico near draft age with an American friend NELSON
FOX on some kind of training base. TITLES END.

first prisoner by the shoulders. Zagon injects the first
prisoner. Instantly the man begins shivering, convulsing.
Zagon watches with professional satisfaction.
ZAGON
That's the nice thing about modern
technology. You don't have to wait
for results.
He moves close to the first prisoner.

it to the others, too.

scarred, missing several fingers. Probably a colonel or
higher, he looks like he's been fighting these round-eyes

customer. The second prisoner meets Zagon's eyes, as if
daring him to use the drugs on him, too. Zagon eyes the
prisoner with barely contained hatred. The prisoner doesn't
back down an inch.

Shut up, Nico.

ZAGON
You can disappear as easy as this
slope, kid --
Zagon starts for the prisoner. Here comes the blade.
Suddenly -- Nico grabs Zagon's shoulder. Zagon spins with
terrifying quickness, cocking the blade to slash at Nico.
Before Zagon's blow even starts, Nico slams him with a
ferocious elbow shot right under the jaw. Zagon literally
comes off the ground, Nico's blow is so terrific. Zagon drops
in an unconscious heap. In a flash the two other CIT men
move to jump Nico. Smash! The second CIT man is swallowing
his teeth. Fox leaps in the way of the third, shoves Nico
out of the hooch --"|unknown

FOX
Are you crazy?!!
(as Nico jerks free)
What the fuck's the matter with you?!!!
Nico is shaking with rage and fear. He takes several steps
away from the hooch, then draws up abruptly. Nico pulls his
.45 from his holster, pops the safety, starts back for the
hooch --
FOX
Nico!
NICO
I don't cap him now, he's gonna do me
later.
The last CIT man appears, gun drawn, in the hooch doorway.
Fox grabs Nico, hauls him back again --
FOX
I'll cover this. Get back to the
L.Z. --
(as Nico resists)
-- I'll fix it! Get out! Get the
fuck outa here!
The CIT man calls out to the Cambodian troops, in dialect,
pointing at Nico. The soldiers start toward Nico, as if to
seize him. Fox, too, starts yelling to the troops in dialect,
apparently countermanding the orders of the CIT men. The
troops, confused, hold up for a moment.
FOX
(to Nico)
I'll call for a chopper... get outa
here!

final ritual on Nico's infant son Julian. The priest
straightens the baby's baptismal garment, tugging the cloth
around the little fellow's crotch. Smiles from friends and
relatives clustered proudly around. Several cops, some in
uniform are amongst them. Nico grabs his son from Genarro
with a theatrical protective motion, tugs up the little boy's
garment, kisses him smack on the bare butt. Laughter from
all as Nico holds the lad high and proud. He puts his arm

Branca laughs. From a distance, Watanabe watches, missing
nothing. Across the porch, Lukich and several other cops
