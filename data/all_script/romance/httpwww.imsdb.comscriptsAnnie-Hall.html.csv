4|ALVY|"There's an old joke.  Uh, two elderly
women are at a Catskills mountain
resort, and one of 'em says: ""Boy, the
food at this place is really terrible.""
The other one says, ""Yeah, I know, and
such ... small portions."" Well, that's
essentially how I feel about life.  Full
of loneliness and misery and suffering
and unhappiness, and it's all over much
too quickly.  The-the other important
joke for me is one that's, uh, usually
attributed to Groucho Marx, but I think
it appears originally in Freud's wit and
its relation to the unconscious.  And it
goes like this-I'm paraphrasing: Uh ...
""I would never wanna belong to any club
that would have someone like me for a
member."" That's the key joke of my adult
life in terms of my relationships with
women.  Tsch, you know, lately the
strangest things have been going
through my mind, 'cause I turned forty,
tsch, and I guess I'm going through a
life crisis or something, I don't know.
I, uh ... and I'm not worried about aging.
I'm not one o' those characters, you know.
Although I'm balding slightly on top, that's
about the worst you can say about me.  I,
uh, I think I'm gonna get better as I get
older, you know?  I think I'm gonna be the-
the balding virile type, you know, as
opposed to say the, uh, distinguished
gray, for instance, you know?  'Less I'm
neither o' those two. Unless I'm one o'
those guys with saliva dribbling out of
his mouth who wanders into a cafeteria
with a shopping bag screaming about
socialism."|speech

6|ALVY|"Annie and I broke up and I-I still can't
get my mind around that.  You know, I-I
keep sifting the pieces of the relationship
through my mind and-and examining my life
and tryin' to figure out where did the
screw-up come, you know, and a year ago we
were... tsch, in love.  You know, and-and-and
... And it's funny, I'm not-I'm not a
morose type.  I'm not a depressive character.
I-I-I, uh,"|speech

car in gear, he inadvertently moves forward, hitting a bunch of trash cans with
a loud crash. Putting the car in reverse, Alvy notices a beige car that has
just turned into the parking lot. For a brief moment, the screen shows a
flashback of the bumper-car ride at the Brooklyn amusement park.  Alvy's father
is on the Platform directing traffic; young Alvy is in a small car bumping
others right and left.  Alvy, hack in the parking lot, backs up his convertible,
purposefully smashing the side of the beige car as another flashback of bumper-
car ride appears, this time-as, Alvy's father directs traffic-a Marine in a
small car bits the back end of a soldier's car, and Alvy, back in the parking
lot, moves his car over to another parked car and bits it full force.
Another flashback appears. people in the small cars really racing around the
track now, bumping into one another over and over again, Alvy's father
directing the flow, as the film cuts back to the parking lot, where Alvy
reverses the convertible and rams it into the front end of yet another car.
He sits behind the wheel as people rush out of various cars and as sirens
start blaring, coming closer and closer, stopping finally as a motorcycle cop
gets off beside Alvy's car and walks over to him."|stage direction

sing:
Annie and Alvy going up the FDR Drive, the day they met playing tennis, Annie
driving, Alvy bolding up partially eaten sandwich.
Annie and Alvy in the Hamptons house kitchen, Annie banding a live lobster to
Alvy, who drops it in the pot on the stove.
Annie and Alvy walking side by side by the shoreline.
Alvy at the tennis club, packing his bag, as he looks over his shoulder and
sees Annie, hands on her face, then clapping, as she offers him a ride home
in her car.
Annie opening the door to Alvy the night he came over to kill the spider; Annie
and, Alvy in the bookstore buying the ""Death"" titles; Annie and, Alvy in
their Hamptons house, Annie reading a school catalogue, the night Alvy puts
in the red light.
The memories continue to flash on the screen: Annie and Alvy at a friend's
house, Alvy blowing the cocaine all over the sofa; Annie and Alvy playing
tennis; Annie and Alvy having a picture taken backstage at the college
performance in Annie's hometown; Alvy bolding Annie close, the night he came
over to kill the spider.
And continue: Annie carrying her luggage and clothes into Alvy's bedroom, Alvy
following, the day she first moved into his apartment.  Annie holding up her
sexy birthday present from Alvy, then leaning over and kissing him; Annie and
Alvy walking down a city street, holding each other close; sitting on the park
bench, observing the people; and kissing, on the FDR Drive, the New York City
skyline behind them.
The music stops.
Returning to the present, the camera, focusing through the cafe window, shows
Annie and Alvy across street.  They look about at the city traffic.  Lunch is
over; it's time.
Alvy and Annie shake hands and kiss each other friendly like.  Annie crosses
the street, Alvy watching her go.  Then he turns, and slowly walks down the
street off screen.  His voice is heard over the scene:"|stage direction

both hadda go, but it was great seeing
Annie again, right?  I realized what a
terrific person she was and-and how much
fun it was just knowing her and I-I
thought of that old joke, you know, this-
this-this guy goes to a psychiatrist and
says, ""Doc, uh, my brother's crazy.  He
thinks he's a chicken."" And, uh, the
doctor says, ""Well, why don't you turn
him in?"" And the guy says, ""I would, but
I need the eggs."" Well, I guess that's
pretty much how how I feet about
relationships.  You know, they're totally
irrational and crazy and absurd and ...
