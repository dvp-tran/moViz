FADE IN:
1   EXT. PENNSYLVANIA COUNTRYSIDE - LONG SHOT - DAY            1
of an empty stretch of land parted down the middle by
railroad tracks. An Amtrak Commuter crests the horizon,
heads TOWARD us. As it gets CLOSER, we GO IN TIGHTER to
see --
2   FACE OF SARA JOHNSON                                       2
17, pressed at one of its windows.
3   REVERSE ANGLE - REFLECTION IN TRAIN'S WINDOW -             3
SARA'S FACE
distant and lovely and sad. SUPERIMPOSED against an
endless stream of sky and trees. The train speeds up and
SARA's face flies by, disappearing FROM FRAME.
4   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN - MOVING - DUSK                          4
A zaftig BLACK WOMAN clumsily negotiates the aisle.
Stops at the first of a few empty seats left in the car.
WOMAN
This seat taken?
ANGLE ON SARA
looking up, around. She shakes her head, clears her
backpack and magazines from the seat beside her. The
Woman drops down, settles in. A long silence. The Woman
glances at the American Ballet magazine on Sara's lap.
Tries to make conversation.
WOMAN
I love ballet. Never had the body
for it. Do you dance?
Sara folds her arms, turns away mumbling under breath.
SARA
Used to.
Sara gazes out the window. The world outside begins to
dissolve melting into images from another time, another
place. Her eyes stare blankly OUT AT us, blinded by her
memories.

5   FLASHBACK - INT. AUDITORIUM - KINDERGARTEN RECITAL - DAY 5
A stage full of five-year-olds in tights and tutus. A
little girl performs center stage. She's remarkably
poised, remarkably good. CAMERA PANS TO the audience. A
woman in an Irish clover necklace springs to her feet
clapping loudly. The little girl's eyes catch the glint
of the necklace's gold. Mommy. She flashes a megawatt
smile, ends the dance with an unscripted bow, as we...
DISSOLVE TO:
6   INT. BALLET CLASS - EVENING (FIVE YEARS LATER)                6
Young Sara, lithe and earnest, dances. A budding beauty
blessed with long limbs and natural grace, she makes it
look easy. Gliding past the envious stares of
classmates, she scans the hall for a glint of gold.
Finds it in the back of the room where her mother, Glynn,
stands watching her. Their eyes connect with mutual
smiles and those smiles CARRY us TO:
7   INT. SARA'S EXETER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                  7
A pair of flexing feet in ballet slippers on a hardwood
floor. PAN UP and PULL BACK to reveal Sara at 17,
dancing in the space opened up by cornered furniture and
rolled up rugs. As Glynn looks on, Sara completes the
routine with a pirouette. She spins out of it with a
preoccupied frown on her face.
GLYNN
What's the matter?   It was good.
SARA
(checks her
stance in mirror)
Everybody there's going to be
good, Mom. I have to be better.
(then, beginning
again)
My knees still knock when I do my
free form. Did you notice that?
GLYNN
I noticed that it was fine.
SARA
(escalating
frustration)
It's not supposed to be fine.
It's supposed to be special.

SARA (CONT'D)
And it just lays there, it doesn't
do anything. I bet they notice
that. That it doesn't do
anything. That I don't do
anything special enough to get in.
GLYNN
Sara.   You'll get in.
SARA
Don't lie because you love me.     My
free form sucks.
GLYNN
(giving up that
battle)
I've got something for you. Come
on. Sit. Mouth closed, eyes
shut. No pouting. No peeking.
Sara flops down on the sofa beside her. Closes her eyes.
Glynn removes the clover chain from her neck, fastens it
around Sara's.
GLYNN
For luck tomorrow. Not that
you'll need it. You dance like an
angel.
The necklace is Glynn's talisman. Sara knows what it
means to her. She throws her arms around Glynn, holds
onto her tightly.
SARA
I love the necklace but you're
still the best luck I'll ever
have.
Glynn, not one to choke up, chokes up.        They cling to
each other.
8   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN (MOVING) - ON SARA - DUSK (PRESENT)          8
In the blink of her eyes, the memory fades. She pulls
the window shade, shifts in her seat. Her fingers travel
to the clover necklace at her throat. Linger. The Woman
regards her.
WOMAN
Nice... the necklace.

3||"A sea of young white faces. A jock entertains the troops
with two straws up his nose. Sara sits next to her best
friend, LINDSAY, 17. Lindsay, chomping on a wad of gum,
turns from the jock to Sara with a bubble in bloom,
bursts it with her teeth."|stage direction|||
4||"LINDSAY
Wanna pray? You're leaving for
Philly after first period. I
won't see you. We should pray.
SARA

Lindsay... no. Not here."|unknown|||

'Awesome, Father, S.J. auditions
today. She's ready for them.
Please make them ready for her.
Even if she screws up. Thanks.
Amen.'

you into Juilliard.

Where'd you get those, traitor?
SARA
Ellison -- Mr. Ellison. He
actually told me to break a leg.
GLYNN
Roses from the principal, even
droopy, out-of-season yellow ones,
is beyond cool, kiddo. You're
definitely movin' up in the world."|unknown|||
11||"Sara looks through the windshield.   It's starting to
drizzle."|stage direction|||
12||"SARA
Know what would be great? If you
didn't drop me off at the bus
station. If we just kept going
until we get to Philly.
GLYNN
Ruin everyone's Valentine's Day
and not have a shop when I get
back. That's your definition of
great? I can see the headline
now: 'Starving Artist Kills Unfit
Mother.'
(gently)
Sweetheart, we talked about this.
I'll get there as soon as I can."|unknown|||
13||Sara looks at her and Glynn instantly feels guilty.|stage direction|||
14||"SARA
Right. This is the hardest, most
important day of my life and all
you can do is get there as soon as
you can. Thanks, Mom.

SARA
So I guess I'll see you later.
GLYNN
I won't miss your audition, Sara.
I'll be there, okay? If I have to
swim the Susquehanna, I'll be
there."|unknown|||
17||"Swim?   You can't swim, Mom.
GLYNN
I'll float then."|unknown|||
18||"A moment. They look at each other. Sara finally smiles.
They embrace and she hops out the van. Glynn calls after
her."|stage direction|||

22||"ROOM - DAY
Sara, in costume, flips through a magazine. She taps her
toes, checks her watch. A phalanx of parents and dancers
are clustered around a sign posted on the door:
JUILLIARD SCHOOL OF DANCE AUDITIONS. Sara stares at it.
Re-checks her watch. An official with a clipboard walks
toward her. Where's her mother?"|stage direction|||

Sara on stage. She looks past a row of Juilliard JUDGES
into the audience. No glint of gold. MOZART'S ""Elvira
Madigan"" (Andante) CUES UP. Sara begins her technical.
She transforms her nervousness into a notable, powerful
performance. The Judges are mutely but clearly
impressed. One of them looks directly at her."|stage direction|||

JUDGE
Is there anything you'd like to
share about your free form before
you begin? A motif... a theme?"|unknown|||
26||"Sara's stomach drops to her feet. Her mother's not there
and her free form sucks and she doesn't have a theme.
Shit!"|stage direction|||
27||"SARA
Well, it's um, pretty self-
explanatory. The theme."|unknown|||
28||"The Judges exchange a look. New MUSIC CUES UP. Some
driving, CLASSICAL NUMBER.   Sara tries to elevate her
body above the music, but she's nervous, unsure on her
feet. She keeps glancing in the back of the auditorium
for Glynn. Searching for her port in the storm.
Wondering where her mother is and knowing how badly she's
dancing. Knowing but somehow continuing, stumbling,
recovering, and finally finishing with those damned
knocking knees. The Judges, eyes like stones,
perfunctorily nod. Their equivalent of maybe next year.
Sara chokes two words out..."|stage direction|||

official catch her as she falls."|stage direction|||

I didn't like leavin' you so soon
after the funeral. I wouldn't

Look. Sara. I feel bad too. I

there's hardly any furniture. Roy lights a cigarette."|stage direction|||
77||"ROY
Not much of what you're used to.
But the water's hot and the fridge
is full. And I made room in the
closets for you. Girl's gotta
have closets, right? You even get
your own bed. I'll crash on the
couch.
SARA
You bought a bed?
ROY
(slight bow)
Pardon me. Your own futon.     Check
it out. On the other side."|unknown|||

remember?

Can I call Lindsay? Let her know

Good idea. Take a break. Not too

Maybe I ain't playin' no grand
