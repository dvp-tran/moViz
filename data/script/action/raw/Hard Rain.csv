THE SHERIFF
In his boat, shining a searchlight on them with one hand, a
gun in the other. He starts shooting.

Tom pushes Karen toward the peak of the roof as the bullets
plug in around them. Tom pushes Karen over the top then turns

light coming from the other side along with gunshots.

Pushes the throttle all the way forward.

He turns, just in time to see...

Flipping end over end, propeller whirring, heading straight
for him.

Starts to scream.
CLOSE ON KAREN
Looking over the peak of the roof in horror. She hears the
Sheriff's scream and the scream of the propeller and then a
horrible ugly ripping and both screams stop.

The Sheriff is gone. The side has been smashed out of the
boat and the boat is flooding with water.
