2||"FADE IN:
On complete darkness.
A SMALL DOOR swings open.
A circle of light reveals that we I re looking down the
length of a tube. At the far end of the tube, we see a
gloved hand dangling a rat. The hand shoves the
frightened rat into the tube and closes the door behind
it. The rat s stark white fur bristles and it begins to
pad down the tube s length.
After several feet, the tube opens up into a dimly lit
cubicle. The rat hesitates and stops.
The SOUNDS of gentle BREATHING whispers in the rat s
ears.
The rat turns round to head back down the tube, but a
door swings shut, trapping it in the cubicle.
The rat cowers as the BREATHING turns to SNORTING.
The rat s head jerks around, looking for signs of danger,
but the cubicle is empty. The rat sees a water dish on
the far side of the cubicle - a place to hide - and
dashes toward it.
But an invisible force descends.
The rat squeals in agony as something smashes down on its
body, crushing it.
A LOUD BELLOW rings out, and the rat flies into the air,
halting a few feet off the ground. Its body writhes,
struggling against the unholy force.
Then a sick crunch of tiny bones snapping. All life
quickly drains from the levitating body. Dead eyes...
The creature s corpse floats in mid-air. Then the white
fur of the rat explodes in a shower of blood.
HUGE BLOOD SMEARED INCISORS appear, as do the red-slicked
ape- like lips. The gaping bloody mouth bites again into
the rat.

Tonight Show. A small lamp and the glow from a computer
screen illuminates SEBASTIAN CAINE, late twenties with
the shabby good looks of a perpetual grad-student. Wiry
framed and wearing only boxer shorts, Sebastian sips
coffee from an  Einstein  coffee mug. He peers at a
complex computer rendered molecule displayed on his
screen. He pecks a few keys and the molecule shifts
slightly, then falls apart.
Sebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box, unwraps the
cellophane and sucks it down. He attacks the keyboard
with renewed vigor.
Another molecule appears on the screen. Sebastian s
fingers fly across the keyboard. The molecule blinks on
and off, it trembles and twists apart."|stage direction

light comes on in a neighboring window. He sees a
BRUNETTE, mid-twenties, absolutely stunning, enter her

it and then begins to undress. Sebastian loans over to
the window, getting interested. But when the brunette
reaches her bra and panties, she crosses to the window

test the formula on. We'd have lost
control of it by the end of the week."|speech

going to happen eventually."|speech

tied by their political agenda when we
go to phase three."|speech

data is human data."|speech

we've succeeded with a gorilla and
their DNA is 98% the same as humans.

houses and cook in microwave ovens.
Gorilla's live in trees. That's a

down there, do a little fast pumping

After all he is faster than a speeding
bullet, right? Anyway, he swoops down,
takes care of business so quick, you

We slowly crane up the fire escape and hold on a window.
Through the wispy curtains and dirty glass we can see
Linda enter the room. The panel of glass fogs from
Sebastian's breath. The fog wipes away, seemingly by
itself.
But then through the window we see Matt walk into the
living room and put his arms around Linda's waist. We
hear a shocked intake of air.
He kisses her neck and then slowly unzips her dress. Her
dress falls to the floor. Matt takes off his sport coat
and drapes it over a chair, while Linda unfastens the
buttons of his shirt. They're laughing now, exchanging
kisses.
Matt reaches behind Linda and unhooks her bra. He kisses
his way down her neck to her breasts. Linda pulls him to
her.
Suddenly the window shatters. Startled, both Matt and
Linda jump back covering themselves.
We hear Sebastian's footsteps as he retreats down the
fire escape.
A moment later Matt reaches the window and peers out. He
sees the fire escape ladder slowly rise back up down
below."|stage direction

AIR-POCKET. It's Sebastian displacing the water. And
because of the water displacement, we can clearly see two
arms pushing Kramer beneath the water's surface.
MARTHA KRAMER opens the bedroom window and looks down at
the pool. All she can see is her husband drowning... his
flailing limbs kicking up a massive air bubble around
him. She races from the window. Kramer kicks and flails
for a few moments and then his limbs stop moving. A
moment later he floats to surface, face down. The AIR
POCKET bobs over to the pool ladder, and rising from the
pool, we see Sebastian's body outlined in sheets of
water. The shape melts away in a cascading waterfall
until all we can see of Sebastian are the hundreds of
