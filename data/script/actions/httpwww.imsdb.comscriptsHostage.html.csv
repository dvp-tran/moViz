black assault gear, M5s, gloved and masked--hustling into
position on either side of the front door.  Only now do we
get the full picture:  Helicopters overhead, radio cars
surrounding the house, an army of cops itching the pull the
trigger --
When the tac team is good to go, the team leader gives a
thumbs-up to --
SERGEANT JEFF TALLEY AND LT. MURRAY LEIFITZ
Talley and Leifitz are hunkered behind the LAPD Command and

her goddamned dog!"|speech

sixteen hours?  Keep talking.  Is that
your dog, too?"|speech
33||Malik steps away from the window --|stage direction
34|MALIK'S VOICE|"I don't know whose dog it is.  She lied
about everything else, so she probably
lied about the dog."|speech
35|TALLEY|"I know you're hurting.  You lose your
job, you find out your wife's fucking
another guy . . . but don't give up.
We'll have her talk to you."|speech
36|MALIK'S VOICE|"Then why won't she open her mouth?!  Why
doesn't the bitch say something???"|speech

not talking to him; he's talking to his wife --"|stage direction
49|TALLEY|"Murray!!  They're in the house!  His
wife's in the house!"|speech
50||"Even as Talley screams, a gunshot echoes from the house,
freezing the moment.  A second shot follows the first as the
tactical team breaches the front door --
Talley sprints forward, running as hard as he can in
nightmare slow motion --"|stage direction
51||INT. MALIK'S HOUSE -- DAY|location
52||"Talley shoulders inside on the heels of the tactical team
through drifting gun smoke and lancing sunlight.  SWAT cops
are cuffing Malik even though he's already dead of a self-
inflicted gunshot wound; Malik's wife is sprawled on the
couch where she has been dead for fourteen hours; two tac
officers are trying to stop the geyser of arterial blood that
sprays from the neck of Malik's nine-year-old son even as one
of them screams for the paramedics --
Talley is numb; it's all too much, too heavy, too horrible.
He kneels between to the tactical cops and takes the boy's
hand.  He stares into the boy's eyes, and the boy stares
back.  The child's face grows pale as he drains of blood.  We
hear his heart beating.  We hear it slow.  We hear it stop.
Talley stares at the dead boy.  The dead boy's lifeless eyes
stare at nothing.
