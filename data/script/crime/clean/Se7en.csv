3||"The white cross on the church steeple stands against blue sky.
The church bell rings, resonating.
Mass has let out.  Small church, small congregation.  The dirt
road in front is lined with pick-up trucks and parishioners on
foot heading to outlying farms and homes.  An old two-story
house sits across the road.  Lone."|stage direction||

5||"Sunlight comes through the soot on the windows, more brown than
bright.  SOMERSET, 45, in a suit and tie, stands in this empty
second-story room.  He looks around, at the ceiling, at the worn
wooden floor, at the peeling wallpaper on the walls.
Somerset walks to one wall where the current wallpaper is peeled
away to reveal flowery wallpaper underneath.  He runs his finger
across one of the pale red roses that decorates the older paper.
He pushes the grime away, brings the rose out more clearly.
He pulls at the edge of the paper, carefully ripping off a
roughly squared section with the rose at its center.
He studies it in his hand."|stage direction||

the speeding train.  He is near the back of the car, away from
the few other passengers.
Outside, farms, small homes and lawns pass.  The entire panorama
is dappled by the rays of the soon setting sun.
The light flickers across Somerset's placid face."|stage direction||

25||"The train is nearly full.  Somerset has his suitcase on the
aisle seat beside him.  He has a hardcover book unopened on his
lap.  He still stares out the window, but his disposition has
soured.  The train is passing an ugly, swampy field.
A car's burnt-out skeleton sits rusting in the bracken.  A little
further on, two dogs are fighting, circling, attacking, their
coats matted with blood.
Somerset turns his head to watch the dogs.
Away in the field, another dog sprints to join the fight."|stage direction||

29||"Curtains closed.  The SOUNDS of the CITY are here as they will
be everywhere in this story.  A CAR ALARM SHRIEKS.  Somerset's
life is packed in many moving boxes, except for clothing in a
closet and hundreds of books on shelves.
Somerset, dressed only in his underwear, lays back on the bed.
He reaches to the nightstand, to a wooden, pyramidical
metronome.
He frees the metronome's weighted swingarm so it moves back and
forth.  Swings to the left... TICK, swings to the right... TICK.
Tick, tick, tick, measured and steady.
Somerset situates on the bed, closes his eyes.  The metronome's
ticking competes with the sound of the car alarm.  Somerset's
face tightens as he concentrates on the metronome.
His eyes close tighter.
Tick, tick, tick... the swingarm moves evenly.  Somerset's
breathing deepens.  The car ALARM seems QUIETER.
Tick, tick, tick.  Somerset continues his concentration.
The METRONOME is the ONLY SOUND.  Somerset's face relaxes
slightly as he begins to fall asleep.  Tick, tick, tick..."|stage direction||

a lean, attractive man, constantly coiled, eyes always
smoldering.  FOLLOW as he walks quickly past iron-gated
storefronts.  He crosses the street under elevated subway
tracks.  A train roars overhead.
Mills watches it as he walks on.
Blue sparks spit off the third rail and illuminate Mills,

skyscraper.  Mills walks, looks at the broken refrigerators and
pieces of junk in the gutter.
Ahead in the street, TWO YOUNG THUGS struggle with a crowbar to
break into the trunk of a parked car.
Mills draws near.  One thug looks up, doesn't think Mills will
be a problem, continues prying.  Mills stops, calm."|stage direction||

45|FIRST THUG|You can fucking suck my...|speech|FIRST THUG|M
46||"Mills swiftly finishes that sentence by smashing his bottle
against the first thug's head.  The thug falls, swings blindly.
The second thug moves from the side, brings out a knife.
Mills averts, swings, pounds the side of his fist into the
second thug's face -- CRACK.  Broken nose.
The second thug stumbles back, drops the knife, his nose
squirting blood.
Mills turns, enraged, breathing hard.
The first thug is screaming, trying to stand.  Mills takes one
step, punts the first thug's head.  The crowbar clatters away.
Mills is in the process of kicking a man when he's down, when
the second thug grabs him from behind, pulls him backwards.
Mills clutches at the thug's arm, trying to avoid a choke-hold.
They both struggle spastically.  The thug's winning.
Gurgling, gasping for air, Mills shifts his weight, drops to one
knee and spins the thug, slamming him against the car.
Mills breaks loose, grabs a handful of the second thug's hair
and holds the man's head against the car's side window.  Mills'
free hand pounds the thug's face: once, twice -- third time's
the charm as the window shatters.  The thug goes out cold.
Mills backs off, still incensed.  He rubs his throat, looking at
the two prone men.  Slowly, he regains some composure.
He takes a keychain from his pocket.  He unlocks the door of the
car, loads one of the thugs into the back seat.  He walks to
collect the other thug off the street."|stage direction||

from a pot on the stove.  Blowing on the steaming tea, she leans
back on the counter, looks over at the closed bedroom door.

bag-lady pass.  Tracy switches hands on the rail, turns sideways
to make room.  She looks down.
On one seat, a man, quite normal looking, sits holding a porno
magazine, THREE-WAY FUCK, in one hand.  His other hand is in his
pocket.  He's obviously masturbating himself in his pants.  No

Mills holds Tracy's hair in his hands, pulls her head back as
she gasps and he thrusts his entire body against hers.
Mills' hair is soaked.  He is anything but mellow as a lover,
quickening while Tracy twists underneath him.  Tracy holds tight
to the back of his neck with one hand.
Finally, Mills pushes himself up on his arms, holding his head
down against Tracy's chest.  Holds for a long moment, till he is
spent and lowers himself against her, into her arms.  He rests a
long time.  She kisses his forehead, keeping her eyes closed.

rope on the floor behind the chair.  The rope is knotted.
Somerset crouches beside the body.  There's a big piece of flesh

more pennies.

Somerset lays flat as he and Mills crawl away from the railing,

wall and a lamp illuminates on a desk.  The desk is in the
center of the room, facing them.  The walls, floor to ceiling,
are covered with visual stimuli; pictures, paintings, newspaper
articles, sketches, writings on napkins and notebook sheets,
etc.  Mostly religious images.
The far wall is made of shelves full of books.  Mills goes to
the desk while Somerset goes to the books.  Books: An Overview
of Theology, Handbook of Firearms, A History of the World, Summa
Theologica, U.S. Criminal Law Review, etc.
Mills looks at the desktop.  The surface is marked by dried oil
colors.  There are tubes of paint laying out, boxes of water
colors and pastels.  Mills looks at one corner of the desk.  An
orange candle has been allowed to burn down.  The wax trail goes
all the way down the edge of the desk to a puddle on the floor.
Somerset walks, studying one wall of pin-ups.  There are
articles about the seven deadly sins, pages from art books,
pencil drawings of Satan and Christ, and drawings of the seven
paneled tableau paintings which inspired the murders.  Somerset
lifts several sheets to note the paper scraps are spaced so
tightly and completely that they cover the window.
At the desk, Mills opens the top middle drawer.  It's empty

art studio.  Windowless, with several easels holding paintings
in various states of completion.  The walls are covered with
photos and finished canvases, except for one wall which is blank
white.  Somerset turns the lights off.
There is a 16mm film projector on a table, facing the blank
wall.  Somerset turns the projector on.  It clatters to life,
running a piece of film.
The film is spliced into a non-stop loop. Somerset watches the
wall, light strobing across him.
The projector shows an image of clouds drifting, with strange,
superimposed angels in flowing robes floating jerkily.  It's
like an old, Hollywood version of heaven.
The image switches abruptly to fire and tormented souls laboring
around a pit of molten goo.  Like Heaven, it's a scratched piece
of film from Hollywood's early days.
Somerset turns to examine one of the paintings on an easel.  The
painting has been skillfully rendered, in small, controlled
brush strokes.  It shows a modern city street, stylized, dark.
The city is peopled by mutated humans and freakish beasts.
Sinners in the streets, killing, raping, pillaging.  Buildings
are burning, blood is being spilled.  It's dense with detail.
Somerset walks to another painting which is covered by a drop
cloth.  He removes the cloth, uncovers a huge canvas.  We do not

fog, hands in his pockets.  He stops at a corner, but does not
cross.  He stands there, looks up.
At the city around him.  The buildings towering over him.
At the cars, buses and taxies racing in the streets, blowing
their horns and spouting soot.
Somerset reaches into his jacket pocket, takes out the envelope
from John Doe.  He studies it in his hand."|stage direction||

his emotions.  He looks around:
At the miserable people, walking past him.
At a man at the top of the subway station stairs, sitting in a
cardboard box, holding out a cup, rattling the change inside.
A father passes by, holding his young son's hand.  Somerset
turns to watch them as they pass.  The gather reaches to pick
the boy up and carry him.  The boy holds tight.
For some reason, this makes Somerset ache with sorrow.
The father hugs his son to him, kisses him on the cheek.  The
boy returns the kiss, with great affection.
Somerset watches them disappear in the mass of humanity.  He
looks back at the note in his hand.
He tears the note up, into little pieces."|stage direction||

She reaches into her pocket, takes out a small manila envelope.
She opens the envelope and slides two keys on a keychain out
into her palm.
She's looking at the keys when she notices something about the
envelope.  She reopens it, takes out a small folded piece of
paper.  She unfolds it:
It is the piece of wallpaper with the pale rose at its center.
She smiles very faintly."|stage direction||
