Written by
Christopher McQuarrie & Nathan Alexander
January 8, 2007
I swear by God this sacred oath:
That I shall render unconditional obedience to
Adolf Hitler, the Führer of the German Reich, and
that I shall at all times be prepared, as a brave
soldier, to give my life for this oath.
1   BLACK                                                   1
And from out of the blackness a voice. A man speaking
in German - faint at first, crackling over the radio.
Subtitles translate the voice of Adolf Hitler.
HITLER (V.O.)
My comrades. Once again - I don't
know how many times it has been now
- an attempt has been made on my
life. I speak to you tonight for
two reasons. First, so that you can
hear my voice and know that I am
unhurt. And second, so that you may
know the details of a crime without
parallel in German history...
2   EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY                                     2
TITLES: SMOLENSK, RUSSIA - THE GERMAN EASTERN FRONT.
13 MARCH 1943.
A lonely airfield. A NAZI OFFICER and his AIDE stand
rigid by a gleaming limousine. The officer's uniform
denotes a man of high rank - a man of weight.
TITLES: MAJOR-GENERAL HENNING VON TRESCKOW - CHIEF OF
STAFF FOR ARMY GROUP CENTER.
Tresckow smokes a cigarette, his arm the only
movement in the frame.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL the airstrip is surrounded by
Army Group vehicles and personnel - SD and SS
escorts, photographers, aides, Nazi party
dignitaries, etc. - all frozen like statues. Eerie.
Whatever is going on, it's big. The faint sound of
distant airplanes brings tension, subtle but sharp.
Approaching the field are three Focke-Wulf 200
Condors escorted by a formation of Messerschmitt-109
fighters. Silence gives way to an escalating roar
that seems to have no maximum. One by one, the
massive four-engine Condors land while the fighters
roar overhead and circle the airfield. The Condors
come to rest and, needing no introduction:
ADOLF HITLER alights from the lead plane, obscured by
the surrounding platoon of heavily armed SS GUARDS.
(Note: Hitler is obscured throughout the entire
sequence proving how inaccessible he truly was.)
2.
Tresckow and his Aide step forward to greet Hitler,
but they are pushed back by SS guards. The Führer
marches past without so much a glance at his hosts or
their waiting limo.
To Tresckow's surprise, a second limousine roars onto
the airfield from out of nowhere. It is dirty, the
windscreen spotted with bugs from a long drive.
Hitler gets in the dirty car and speeds off.
VOICE (O.S.)
It's not so much your car he
doesn't trust... It's your driver.
Tresckow and his Aide turn. Standing behind them is:
TITLES: COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT - SENIOR STAFF OFFICER
OF THE ARMY OPERATIONS SECTION.
The consummate Nazi, he is always scribbling notes in
a small datebook. Without looking up, Brandt hops
into the limo they brought for Hitler.
Tresckow and his Aide share a glance and get in. A
beat later they are speeding after Hitler's car.
3   EXT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - DAY                              3
Est. Hitler's headquarters for the Eastern Front is
bustling. Security is tight, everyone is on edge.
4   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - MESS HALL - DAY                  4
Long tables packed with SOLDIERS straining their
necks to get a glimpse of their leader at the head
table, but he is obscured by his detail of SS guards.
ONE MAN dares to approach. The room falls silent.
HITLER'S PERSONAL CHEF places a tray before the
Führer, producing a knife and fork, cutting a bite.
We think he is going to hand feed Hitler until he
places the food in his own mouth, chewing slowly,
deliberately. He swallows. We wait for him to die.
When he doesn't, Hitler begins to eat. The rest of
the room relaxes slightly and digs in.
ANGLE ON: Seated further down the table are Tresckow
and his Aide. Between them, once again, is Brandt,
eating like a pig, still making notes in his book.
Tresckow stares.

TRESCKOW
Managing the Führer's security must
be quite an undertaking.
BRANDT"|unknown
1||"Irregularity is the Führer's
precaution of choice.
TRESCKOW
I can assure you he's safe here.
Relax, Brandt. Enjoy your meal.
Brandt's look says, ""Don't be ridiculous."" He cleans
his plate in seconds. Then he gently dabs his mouth,
takes out his datebook and starts writing - once
again the precise man we saw on the airfield.
TRESCKOW (CONT'D)
I understand you're returning to
Berlin this afternoon...
Brandt nods.
TRESCKOW (CONT'D)
Could I trouble you to deliver a
package to Colonel Stieff?
Brandt nods again, too busy writing to notice the
knowing glance Tresckow shares with his Aide...
5   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - PRIVATE OFFICE - LATER          5
Tense silence. Tresckow and his Aide are hunched over
two bottles of Cointreau on a large desk next to:
TWO PAIRS OF BRITISH `CLAMS' - a small black plastic
casing held together by magnets and adhesive tape.
Tresckow inserts a short, pencil-shaped fuse through
the narrow opening. All that remains exposed is a
small glass capsule. The trigger. Tresckow turns his
attention to the bottles of Cointreau...
6   EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY                                      6
The Condors' engines roar, ready for take off.
Soldiers stand at attention as Hitler boards. Brandt
is with him, scribbling in his ever-present datebook.
4.
Tresckow and his Aide approach. Tresckow gently
handles a carefully wrapped package.
CLOSE ON: Tresckow presses a key against the side of
the package, crushing the glass capsule inside. The
explosive armed now, he hands it to Brandt.
TRESCKOW
With my regards to Colonel Stieff.
Brandt accepts the gift, looking up from his book. He
studies the familiar shape.
BRANDT
Cointreau? You better hope I don't
get thirsty on the flight.
Tresckow politely smiles, hiding his nerves, having
just handed a bomb to Hitler's Head of Security.
Brandt unknowingly carries it onto the plane with
Hitler. The door to the Condor is sealed behind him
along with, we hope, the Führer's fate.
Tresckow looks at his watch and we DISSOLVE TO:
7   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - PRIVATE OFFICE - LATER             7
A clock shows us that thirty minutes have passed.
Tresckow and his Aide are seated on either side of a
desk staring at the telephone. Smoking. Waiting...
DISSOLVE TO:
8   INT. ARMY GROUP CENTER - PRIVATE OFFICE - LATER             8
Three hours later. The ashtray is overflowing but
Tresckow and his Aide have not moved. Finally...
The phone barely rings before Tresckow answers. He
doesn't say a word, he only nods and hangs up.
TRESCKOW
He's... landed.
It takes a moment for the gravity of this to set in.
AIDE
What about the...
Tresckow is already dialing the telephone.
5.
TRESCKOW
Get me Colonel Brandt...
(staying cool)
Colonel? Tresckow... I trust you
landed safely... I hate to trouble
you but there's been a bit of a mix
up. It seems you have the wrong
bottles for Colonel Stieff. You...
do still have the package?"|unknown
2||Long pause. Torture. Then:|stage direction
3||"TRESCKOW (CONT'D)
I can be at your office first thing
tomorrow morning to pick it up.
Terribly sorry for the
inconvenience... Thank you."|unknown
4||Tresckow slowly hangs up the phone.|stage direction
5||"AIDE
Do you think he knows?"|unknown
6||"Tresckow shrugs, opening a bottle of Cointreau and
pouring two glasses with a shaking hand."|stage direction

There's only one way to be sure...

Tresckow marches with purpose through the numerous
security checkpoints. It is a long, suspenseful walk.
He is aware of someone walking up behind him, getting
closer. We think he's done for, but a BESPECTACLED,
MIDDLE-AGED OFFICER overtakes him and whispers:"|stage direction

came for him last night."|speech

Olbricht hurries after him.

29||"Just then, they approach the final threshold, a
SENTRY guards an office marked:
COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT.
Olbricht stops, regarding the door with dread. But
Tresckow presses on, reaching the door, about to
enter when:
SENTRY"|unknown
30|(in between mouthfuls)|Your pistol please.|speech
31||"Oh shit. Tresckow plays it cool, removing his pistol
from its holster and handing it over.
And with a nod to Olbricht, Tresckow squares his
shoulders and enters Brandt's office.

11   INT. OKH HEADQUARTERS - BRANDT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS    11"|unknown
32||"Brandt is at his desk, writing as always. Tresckow
notices Brandt's pistol sitting within arm's reach. A
clock ticks loudly. Imagine it. Then wait. Finally:
Brandt puts his pen down, stands and salutes, but the
gesture is almost casual. Pure formality."|stage direction
33||"BRANDT
You'll forgive me, General. This
little round-up has had me writing
reports all day.
TRESKOW
Round-up?
BRANDT
Dissenters. A plot against the
Führer."|unknown
34||Tresckow makes a good show of laughing that off.|stage direction
35||"TRESKOW
Who would even have the balls?
BRANDT
You'd be surprised, the number of
cowards in this army that would be
willing to stand against the Reich.
TRESKOW
Only if the Führer were dead, of
course.
BRANDT
Of course. It's one thing to think
you know what's right. What matters
is having the strength to do it."|unknown
36||"Clunk. Brandt produces the package, putting it on the
desk in front of him."|stage direction
37||"BRANDT (CONT'D)
Is this what you've come for?"|unknown
38||Pause. Staying cool, Tresckow reaches for it:|stage direction

Perhaps we should open it."|unknown

TRESCKOW
I beg your pardon."|unknown
42||Brandt sits back, smiles. Does he know?|stage direction
43||"BRANDT
You've come a long way. You must be
thirsty.
TRESCKOW
I wonder how the Führer, who does
not partake, would feel about an
officer who did so on duty...
Colonel Brandt."|unknown
44||"Brandt's smile fades. We can't decide why. He picks
up the package carelessly. Tresckow stays cool
despite the armed explosive just a few feet away."|stage direction
45||"BRANDT
I took you for another sort,
General."|unknown
46||"And we realize he really did just want a drink. He
knows nothing about what the package hides."|stage direction

PANZER DIVISION. 7 APRIL 1943.
Moving rapidly through an olive grove in the
otherwise wasted desert. A column of tanks, trucks
and heavy equipment flow by with a sense of barely
contained chaos. Men dismantle tents from around
others dumping documents into burning oil drums.
In the middle of it we find a tall, handsome young
officer (age 35). He wears an Afrika Korps uniform
complete with Colonel's badges, staying cooler than
the other side of your pillow. He directs men this
way and that, holding back panic.

A jeep speeds up to him from the distance, driven by
a YOUNG LIEUTENANT.

five kilometers from here. You've
done all you can."|speech

in our coming to Tunis?"|speech

60|STAUFFENBERG|To get taken prisoner, it seems.|speech
61||"Stauffenberg smiles bitterly and gets in the jeep as:
BOOM. The first bomb explodes before we even see the
tight formation of BRITISH FIRE-BOMBERS overhead.
Fighter planes strafe with machine-guns. Artillery
blasts strike in front and behind the retreating
column. The 10th Panzer Division is trapped.
Panic hits the column like a tidal wave. Stauffenberg
taps the Young Lieutenant who drives into the melee.
Soldiers abandon their vehicles but cover is in short
supply and many are left in the open. So they run.
Dozens are gunned down by the assailing fighters. The
survivors watch in horror as the fighters slowly turn
to make another run. In a panic, the soldiers run the
other direction, halted by a jeep blocking the way.
Stauffenberg stands in the passenger seat.

STAUFFENBERG
STOP. WAIT UNTIL THEY COMMIT."|unknown

68||"The mob of soldiers breaks - some right, some left -
as the fighters open fire on what had been the center
of their mass. Unable to change course quickly
enough, they spray their lead into the sand.
In that same instant, Stauffenberg drops into his
seat, the Young Lieutenant jams the jeep in drive and
a wave of hot lead misses them by mere feet.
Stauffenberg watches his men regroup, waiting out the
turning squadron. They've got the idea now. He turns
to his Lieutenant who smiles admiringly. But
Stauffenberg's eyes widen. He grabs his Lieutenant's
head and jams it down, revealing a STRAY FIGHTER
coming up from behind. Stauffenberg ducks out of
frame, shielding the Young Lieutenant with his body.
BANG. Blood sprays across the jeep's windshield
before bullets rip it to pieces, leaving only clear
blue African sky... And then the EXPLOSION.

bravely turns to the Doctor. ""Well?"""|stage direction

Stauffenberg tries to speak but can't. His eye begins

Nina removes a ring from her finger, placing it on a
chain with a cross she takes from around her neck. It
is identical to the ring Stauffenberg wore in Africa.
CLOSE ON: The engraving inside the band - finis-
initium [end-beginning]. Nina places the ring and
chain on her husband's chest, her hand lingering. She
cannot hold the tears back any longer. She stands and
turns away, not wanting her husband to see.
Berthold takes her place. Stauffenberg struggles to
speak. Berthold puts an ear to the hole where
Stauffenberg's mouth is - making out his question,
even if we can't. Berthold debates answering, then:"|stage direction

A man's belongings tell you more about him than he
ever could. Stauffenberg's side of the room is neatly

A family photograph shows the Stauffenberg's of
another generation - wealthy aristocrats from a
bygone era. He is a teenager in this photo and
smiling broadly. A smile he left in Africa.
Stauffenberg's three fingers push a cotton ball under
his eyepatch to dab the empty socket. Then he goes to
button his shirt. Holding his collar in his teeth, he
tries to do the buttons with the use of only three
fingers on his left hand. It is heartbreaking to
watch.
He is about to give up when he notices a figure
looming in the doorway. General Olbricht. He winces

enters the frame, gently placing a medal identical to
the one just saw.
PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Stauffenberg, done up in his
finest dress uniform, placing said medal on an

AN AIDE stands behind him, carrying a silver tray

PULL BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL: Stauffenberg stands
between two long rows of beds, each with A WOUNDED
SOLDIER. Those that can respond to Stauffenberg do so
with reverence. The ward is eerily silent.
With only three fingers, Stauffenberg cannot pin the
medals to his men. He has to settle for simply laying
them on a each soldier's chest or a pillow. With each
medal he presents, the task becomes harder to watch.

looking at THE YOUNG LIEUTENANT - his driver in

gone, his face smashed.

COLONEL HEINZ BRANDT - the same Brandt who carried

ago. He still scribbles in his damn datebook.
Freyend sets the briefcase beside Stauffenberg -
bumping Brandt's leg. Brandt looks down at the
briefcase - long enough to make us nervous.
He watches as Stauffenberg nonchalantly bends down,
sliding the briefcase as close to Hitler as possible,
leaning it against the heavy wooden table support
immediately to the right of Hitler's foot.
Stauffenberg looks back at the open door, glances at
his watch. He can clearly see Sergeant Adam, the

Around him generals talk, Hitler nods, but we hear
nothing. Only the pulse of Stauffenberg's heartbeat
in his own ears - the only thing betraying his
otherwise outward calm.

his feet. He looks at Hitler nodding. The longer we
stay, the more excruciating it is. So we milk it.

1194||"A series of images of the coup being reversed as the
Nazis take back power, made all the more poignant by
the lonely sound of the phonograph, the music slowly
rising, growing clearer and eventually becoming score
over the silent images of:
Conspirators being rounded up and arrested. Among
them are faces we recognize...

circle - headlamps marking the scene in stark white
light and long black shadows.
Stauffenberg, Haeften, Olbricht and Mertz are marched
into the courtyard, squinting in the harsh light as
they are placed against the wall of the War Ministry."|location
1196||"HITLER (V.O.)
I speak to you tonight for two
reasons. First, so that you can
hear my voice and know that I am
unhurt. And second, so that you may
know the details of a crime without
parallel in German history..."|unknown

EXT. WAR MINISTRY - NIGHT
TEN SOLDIERS of the Deutschland Guard Battalion
scramble to form a line opposite Stauffenberg and his
conspirators. We can clearly read Fromm's lips,
shouting: ""MAKE READY...""
Stauffenberg and Haeften share a reassuring smile.
Remer watches bitterly from the shadows, focusing his
hatred not on the conspirators... but on Fromm.
INT./EXT. BERLIN - VARIOUS - NIGHT
Berthold, Stauffenberg's brother, is taken from his

A small clique of ambitious,

Stauffenberg takes a breath and shouts defiantly, his
lips reading: ""Long live sacred German-""
Fromm drops his hand. Ten rifles open fire.
CRANE UP and away as the music swells, as what is
left of Berlin comes into view, as the few lights
that remain suddenly go out as if a dark shadow were
passing over the land."|location
1202||"HITLER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
I see in this the hand of
Providence... directing me to
complete my work."|unknown
1203||"And the last strains   of music resolve in a single,
sustained note as we   CRANE UP FURTHER, looking at
last to the overcast   darkness of the night sky. The
last note goes on as   if it might play forever...
Until suddenly it dips and we realize we are no
longer hearing music at all, but the urgent wailing
of an air-raid siren - the warning of allied bombers
coming to deliver their nightly assault on Berlin.
Hitler's gift to Germany."|location
