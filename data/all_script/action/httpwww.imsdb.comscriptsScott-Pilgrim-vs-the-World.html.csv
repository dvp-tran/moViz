STACEY (O.S.)
Seventeen years old? Scandal!
Intercut with STACEY PILGRIM, cute, peppy barista, gabbing on

Scott glances down at the partially obscured NOW magazine,
looking into the HOT GIRL'S EYES on the back cover album ad.
STACEY (CONT'D)
So, are you legitimately moving on,

123|WALLACE|"You're too good for him. Run.
11 INT. THE ARCADE - DAY 11
Scott and Knives play NINJA NINJA REVOLUTION (think a martial
arts version of DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION).
They punch and kick in unison, side by side."|speech
124|SCOTT|"Did you know the original name of Pac-
man was Puck-man? You would think it's
because Pac-Man looks like a yellow
hockey puck, but actually it comes
from the Japanese phrase paku-paku
which means to flap ones mouth open
and closed. They changed it over here
because Puck-Man is too easy to
vandalize. You know, scratch out the P
and turn it into an F or whatever?
Knives flips over Scott's back in a COMBO move."|speech

never suspected that we rocked as a
unit. Thank you, Knives.
13 INT. SONIC BOOM (RECORD STORE) - DAY 13
Scott and Knives flip through records in perfect sync."|speech
