He has a habit of blinking hard before speaking."|speech

The other teachers laugh."|speech

VOICE (O.C.)
Wally, can I just say one quick thing?
Wally turns to AMY SQUIRREL, late 20s, cute and
wholesome. Any trace of sexuality she might have is
wiped away by her adult pigtails. She treats students
and adults alike -- like students."|speech
8|AMY|"Just wanted to remind everyone the school
day's not over. So let's keep the
drinking under control, hmm? That's it.
Back to you, Wally.
A bunch of teacher roll their eyes."|speech

But now as the summer is upon us, it's

school year, but to also say goodbye to a
member of our faculty."|speech

ELIZABETH HALSEY, mid 20s, pretty and petite, walks up to

slightly more cosmopolitan than the other teachers.
PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
You've only been with us for one short
year, but know that you'll always be a
part of the JAMS family.
Elizabeth gives Principal Snur an appreciative smile.
The Teachers lightly applaud.
PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
And we got you a little something.
Wally hands Elizabeth an envelope. She opens it and.
pulls out a gift card: BOSTON MARKET. $37."|speech

12|PRINCIPAL SNUR|Why don't you say a couple words?|speech

ELIZABETH (V.0.)
My students, probably most of all.I'm not
saying they were little angels, butthey
were all there to learn and that'sthe
greatest gift a student can give a teacher.
Elizabeth's class is horsing around, enjoying the last
days of seventh grade.
A dim-looking BOY tentatively approaches her desk with
his yearbook in hand. He hands it to Elizabeth, who
considers what to write for a beat, then smiles as she
signs it."|speech

SIXTH, SEVENTH and EIGHTH graders all race past her,
running toward their summer vacation.
ELIZABETH (V.0.)
And I wish that I had gotten to know all of
you better, but between four classes and
planning a wedding, I had my hands full.
From the little I do know about you, I know
that our students are in good hands.

thicket on the outskirts of the school property.
ELIZABETH (V.0.)
And I can't believe it's all over. This
year flew by. And even though I'll never
teach again professionally, I've realized
that I don't need a blackboard and
classroom to set an example.
Elizabeth comes up behind them."|speech
20|ELIZABETH (CONT'D)|"Hand it over.
The Burnouts' eyes all go wide and they freeze. One of
the burnouts hands her the joint."|speech

The kids look at each other and then pull out a bag with
a couple of joints. They hand it over to Elizabeth."|speech

call the principal. I call the cops."|speech

box out the window and extends her hand, giving the
school THE FINGER.
ELIZABETH (O.S.)
Woo-hoo!
A couple students look at her strangely."|speech

He flips to the faculty section, and by the picture of
Elizabeth is her message: ""YOU ARE ILLITERATE!"""|speech

You are... Illit... Illit...
Elizabeth's car comes barrelling toward him and nearly
hits him.
She accelerates into the speed bumps, almost hitting the

letters to read, ""HAVE A GREAT SUMMER!"""|speech

MARK (O.S.)
Coming!
MARK, early 30s, exits the bedroom in his underwear.
He's shaved his head to avoid signs of early balding and
is also a full four inches shorter than Elizabeth.
Thankfully for him, he has money."|speech
33|"MARK (CONT'D)
(ANXIOUS)"|"Hey! That was a quick party.
Elizabeth kisses Mark on the top of his head and hands
him a glass."|speech

joke.
She raises her glass for a toast. He raises his."|speech

And I owe it all to you, Lover.
Elizabeth takes a big sip."|speech
36|"ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

towards the door. Elizabeth brushes past him into --"|speech

Elizabeth looks around -- under the bed, in the closet,
behind the door."|speech
39|MARK|"See? Nothing.
Just then, the wooden chest at the foot of the bed SNEEZES.
Elizabeth opens the latch to find SHEILA, 23, dressed only
in a thong, scrunched in the fetal position. She stands,
revealing LARGE FAKE BREASTS, and steps out of the chest."|speech
40|"ELIZABETH
(TO MARK)"|Motherfucker!|speech
41|ELIZABETH|"How could you do this to me?!
I'm sorry."|speech

43|"ELIZABETH
(TO SHEILA)"|Get out of my house, bitch!|speech
44|MARK|Don't talk to her like that.|speech

I love her.
Mark puts his arm around Sheila. Elizabeth eyes Sheila's
large breasts."|speech
46|ELIZABETH|You love her? She's a hooker.|speech
47|MARK SHEILA|"She's not a hooker. I dance.
Elizabeth takes a deep breath."|speech
48|"ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
(SWEET)"|"Listen, Marky, you made a mistake.
You're human. I'm human. And this time
it was you. Maybe six months from now,
you'll walk in on me. I don't know, but
probably.
Sheila SNEEZES again."|speech
49|ELIZABETH (CONT'D)|"Shut the fuck up.
(then, to Mark, sweet)
And. maybe I'm talking crazy, but I don't
want to throw away our life together over
something like this. We're getting
married! I'm willing to fight for us."|speech
50|MARK|"I'm not. And you know why? Because
Sheila loves me -- and not just for my
money.
Sheila squeezes his shoulder."|speech
51|ELIZABETH|"I'm sorry if I care that my future husband
can support me. We didn't all grow up
with a silver spoon in our mouths. You
can't even imagine what it's like going to
bed hungry, night after night."|speech
52|MARK|"What are you talking about?! Both your
parents are CPAs."|speech
53|ELIZABETH|"My parents worked their asses off to send
me to private school. Do you know what
it's like driving a Pontiac when everyone
else gets a Beemer the second they
menstruate? That shit stays with you."|speech
54|MARK|It's over, Elizabeth.|speech
55|ELIZABETH|"For the record, there's a shitload of
things that I hate about you, but I still,
would've gotten married.
(beat, sweet)
Because I love you."|speech
56|MARK|"(rolls his eyes)
I'm gonna need the ring back.
She grabs her bag and heads for the exit. Mark follows."|speech

your hooker enjoy chlamydia together!"|speech
58|MARK|Elizabeth. The ring.|speech
59|ELIZABETH|"(not turning around)
I'm not even listening to you anymore.
She starts to open the door. He closes it.
The ring!"|speech
60|ELIZABETH|"Like I even want your gay-ass ring.
She tries pulling it off."|speech
61|ELIZABETH (CONT'D)|"It's not coming off. I'll go to the
jeweler's tomorrow.

rarely gets emailed, pokes her head in."|speech

you just get another job?"|speech

Work at a day care center?

You know, when I first got into teaching,
I thought I was doing it for all the
right reasons: short hours, summers off,
no accountability."|speech
102|LYNN|I love my summers. Fresh corn. Mmm.|speech

finding a guy who will take care of me --"|speech

doesn't ask too many questions.

I spent most of my summer hanging out at
the bars near where the Bulls practice.
Had some fun, got some cool souvenirs that
I Ebayed, but those guys aren't looking to
settle down. And they all wear condoms.
And then they take the condoms with them.
That's how paranoid they are that a girl
will try and get pregnant. Like it's so
easy to get pregnant from a guy nutting
into a condom."|speech
106|LYNN|You're gonna find someone great.|speech
107|ELIZABETH|"I've been thinking about it a lot. I mean,
I figure I'm like an 8, 8.5. But once I
get my new tits, I'll probably be a --

already so pretty."|speech

she rest in peace.

orientation for teachers in the auditorium."|speech

Ooohhh..."|speech
114|LYNN|"Yeah, I probably won't go either. I
don't know I might. I'll probably go,
but just sit in the back. Maybe leave
early. Maybe stay till the end. Play it
by ear. Or just stay till the end.
Lynn takes both their, trays and dumps them."|speech
115|LYNN (CONT'D)|This was fun.|speech

splitting the cafeteria into quadrants.
Elizabeth yawns."|speech

system to work, it's vital that each
teacher maintain order within their
quadrant. Because it's really tough for
me as head lunch monitor -- or another
teacher -- to leave their quadrant to
discipline a kid in another quadrant. I
know it's a lot to take in. I'd be happy
to sit with-you after school and explain
all of the new guidelines."|speech

tell you how to run your class, but maybe
it might be fun to do some ice-breakers.
