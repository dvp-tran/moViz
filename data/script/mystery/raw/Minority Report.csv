-- Aug 15th 1997 rewrite by Jon Cohen
DARKNESS
And then, slowly emerging from the mists of darkness, a pale,
beautifully proportioned FACE.
The oval face is female, a woman of indeterminate age, her
features as fragile as porcelain.  Her eyes are closed in
sleep, or in death ... or in something in between.
Now TWO MORE FACES emerge out of the darkness.  They are
male, and they float into position on either side of the
female.  They are just as ethereally beautiful, just as pale,
and like the female their eyes are closed.
The ghostly lips of the female begin to twitch.  Her features,
which have been expressionless, suddenly contort, mask-like,
into the face of a woman in fear.  Her eyes open.
The male face on her right contorts too.  His features warp
into an angry snarl -- the mask of a man enraged.  His eyes
open.
The male face on her left takes on the expression of a young
boy, a boy who is terribly frightened.  His eyes open wide.
As if they are lost in the same terrible waking dream, a
sudden and unnerving exchange begins ..."|stage direction

we can imagine a terrible struggle taking place before us: a
man with scissors lunging at his wife, her anguished scream,
the whimpering cries of their son.
And then there is silence, and it is over, and the three
faces instantly return to their impassive porcelain state.
Their eyes slowly close.  They do not move.
So that when they do move again, it is startling.  In abrupt
unison, the EYES flash open.  Three pairs of eyes stare
straight at us, accusing.
Three mouths open, but speak, in rasping tones, as one."|stage direction

24||EXT. SUBURBIA  DAY|location
25||"Morning in America.  Just look at it.  America in the
midfifties, the suburban landscape stretching endlessly into
the sun drenched distance.  White house upon white house.
Emerald lawns, glistening with dew.
In each driveway, a big Chevy, or a Ford, muscled with chrome,
long tailfins that taper like the fins on rocket ships.
Kids burst out of the houses, and zoom down sidewalks on
trikes.  Mothers in bright dresses stand in doorways,
watching.  The smiling mothers wave to one another, then go
back into their houses.
Dogs bark, birds sing in trees of just the right height,
boys and girls laugh and ring the bells on their trikes.  It
is a delicious world, where dogs and birds and children are
safe."|stage direction
26||INT. A HOUSE|location
27||"A family room with all the trappings of the era: a flagstone
fireplace, a console TV, a man's leatherette Barca-Lounger,
a pipe stand holding two pipes on a nearby table, boxes of
children's games neatly stacked on a wall shelf."|stage direction
28||3.|unknown
29||"A young mother, CAROL, her hair -in a pony-tail, stands at a
picture window in a corner of the family room, staring mildly
at the scene outside.
CAROL'S POV - A LITTLE GIRL
A little girl bounces a red ball on the sidewalk.  The ball
gets away from her, and rolls into the street.
At the same moment, a two-toned CHEVY, lush and huge, rounds
the corner.
The girl sees the car coming, but still goes after the ball.
THE FAMILY ROOM
Carol sees what is about to happen -- but she doesn't cry
out, or bang on the window, or run for the front door.  She
watches.  And smiles a little.
OUTSIDE
The girl careens gleefully into the middle of the street.
INSIDE THE CHEVY
The driver -- a man in a loose fitting dark green suit, white
shirt, thin brown tie -- sits behind the steering wheel of
the car.
Disturbingly, the man's hands are not on the steering wheel.
Not only that, he is holding the morning newspaper up in
front of him, reading, oblivious to the scene before him.
Through the windshield, we see the little girl in the road
in front of him, going for her ball.
CAROL Watches, her smile in place."|stage direction
30||"OUTSIDE
The little girl picks up her red ball, as the Chevy bears
down on her."|unknown
31||"INSIDE THE CHEVY
An alarm suddenly CHIRPS.  The car automatically brakes to a
halt.  The man looks around the edge of his paper to see
what is happening.
THE STREET
The car has stopped, inches from the girl.
The girl giggles as, the man in the car gives her a big wink.
She waves, then runs back to the sidewalk with her red ball."|stage direction
32||4.|unknown
33||"The man goes back to his newspaper, and the car, entirely on
its own, starts up again.  The car rounds a corner, and
disappears.
INSIDE THE HOUSE
Carol turns away from the window.  She startles when she
sees her husband, JOHNNY, is there behind her.  He is in his
pajamas.  How long has he been there, watching her?"|stage direction

hair tousled with sleep, scratching his stubbled jaw,
considering her."|stage direction
40|JOHNNY|"I'm unhappy that you let me sleep so
long."|speech
41||"He takes another step toward her.  She doesn't move a muscle.
A little BOY suddenly enters the room.  Johnny turns, looks
at his son, looks back over his shoulder at his wife.  Then,
without a word, he begins to walk out of the room.  On his
way out, Johnny's eyes flick to Carol's sewing basket, which
sits beside a sewing machine.  It is not the sewing that has
caught his attention, but a large pair of garment SCISSORS
which lie across a fold of colored cloth."|stage direction
42||EXT. THE HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER|location
43||"Johnny stands on the front porch, scratching.  He walks down
his front walk, and bends over to pick up the newspaper.
Carol stands in the doorway, watching him.
A SHADOW slides over Johnny, cast from above.  The air fills
with the piercing WHINE of an engine.  Johnny looks up,
alarmed.
In the sky above him, just beyond the tips of the suburban
trees, is a black PRECRIME POLICE HOVERCRAFT.
The children, the mothers, Carol in the doorway -- everyone
freezes in place, as Johnny is cast into an inexplicable
drama.
Racing SOUNDLESSLY down the street toward him, are SLEEK
TECHNOLOGICAL MARVELS, lethal and efficient looking -- they
seem to be cars -- but they are so different from the fat
Fords and Chevies in the driveways that it is hard for us to
process them."|stage direction
44||5.|unknown
45||"Helmeted police with mirrored visors erupt out of the cars.
More police drop from the hovercraft in harnesses.  Their
uniforms are black, seem actually to absorb light.  Their
left hands are bare, their right hands are encased in some
sort of complicated glove.
CLOSE
ON - A GLOVE
The glove is a weapon of some kind, the elongated index finger
ending in an open barrel.
Clearly, this is not, as it first seemed, the past -- not
America in the 1950's.  It is the neo-past, the retro world
of America 2040, where the familiar of yesterday is
intermeshed with hypertechnology.
And all of that hypertechnology is focused on JOHNNY, as he
makes a run for the house, sheets of newspaper scattering
behind him.  He bursts up the front porch, shoving Carol out
of the way.
Eight Precrime police officers assemble in the yard. From a
backpack, one of them quickly removes an instrument with a
handle grip and an ovoid screen.  It is a holographic scanner.
He activates it, scans the OFFICER in front of him, and an
IDENTICAL POLICE OFFICER takes three-dimensional form.
The two real officers circle the house, repeating the maneuver
a dozen times.
In less than a minute, a decoy force of men -- three
dimensional, standing in place, but shifting and turning
like living beings -- has been created.  An overwhelming
police deterrent presence has been established.
INSIDE THE HOUSE
The Precrime police overwhelm the interior of the house,
too.  It is impossible to tell which officers are real, and
which are scanned holographs.  The juxtaposition of the
futuristic cops in a 1950's style house is disorienting.
INSIDE A BEDROOM CLOSET
Johnny, in his pajamas, crouches beneath a rack full of his
wife's dresses.
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
Two OFFICERS, standing back-to-back, hold their gloved hands
out in front of them, palm out.  When the first officer points
his palm toward a door at the end of the hallway, his glove
BEEPS softly."|stage direction

47||"The officer looks at his PALM.  A red thermal IMAGE appears
on a small flexible screen -- the heat outline of a crouching
man.  The first officer flicks his helmeted head to the second
officer.
THE BEDROOM
The room is packed with police -- how many are real?
THE CLOSET
Johnny squirms, his pajamas saturated with sweat.  He calls
out through the door."|stage direction
48|JOHNNY|I didn't do anything!|speech
49||"OUTSIDE THE CLOSET
Every OFFICER in the room lifts his gloved hand and points
his index barrel at the closet door.  The effect is deeply
accusatory.
An OFFICER speaks, his VOICE electronically manipulated to
be as menacing as possible."|stage direction
50|OFFICER 1|"Come out of the closet on your hands
and knees."|speech
51||"Nothing happens.  Two officers aim their barrels at the
perimeter of the door.  In repeated, small SONIC BLASTS, the
closet door is blown off of its frame, revealing Johnny among
the dresses.
Johnny starts to rise, and BAM, a section of floorboards is
blasted away beneath his feet."|stage direction
52|OFFICER 1|Hands and knees!|speech

He stays on his hands and knees, and approaches.  He lifts
his head and looks up at the officer."|stage direction

55||"Another OFFICER 2 bends down with a DEVICE -- the words
""IdentiScan"" on its side -- and blips a red laser light

late thirties, Director of the Precrime Division, Washington
D.C.
The second man is ED WITWER, Anderson's second in command,
late thirties, big like Anderson, good face, strong in the
shoulders, short brown hair.
The two men are deeply comfortable together.  They can speak,
or not.  It doesn't matter -- they still communicate.  Two
good cops, good together.
They walk side-by-side around the house, dematerializing the
holographic decoy cops."|stage direction

A thin METALLIC ARM arches down from the sun visor, scans

first disc.
She places it in the specialized monitor on the judge's bench.
The tv and the judge's monitor sit side by side.  The tv
plays the version of the murder from the second disc; the
judge's monitor plays the version from the first disc.
She stares intently, her eyes flicking back and forth from
one version to the other.  They seem absolutely identical.
When the judge's monitor goes blank, she starts it over again.
