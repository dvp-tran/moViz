INT CLUB - NIGHT
Rave music blares. Tom stands off to the side looking
miserable. Summer is on the dance floor. Though she's not
really dancing with anyone in particular, she's dancing with
everyone. Finally she comes over, white shirt dripping with

FADE UP: ""YOU MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE"" by Hall and Oates.
EXT STREET - MORNING
The worst morning ever.
Tom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom sulks
down the street. Though it's sunny and warm, Tom is a sad,
broken man and the world is an awful place. There's still
Hall and Oates following Tom, almost trying to cheer him up.
He checks out his reflection in a window. Ron Howard's
brother Clint looks back.
Tom walks by a COUPLE making out on a bench. He grimaces.
He walks by a sign that says ""TODAY ONLY: FREE BEER."" He
doesn't even stop.
Cartoon Bird returns but Tom swats it away.
The WORLD'S MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN stops to ask him for
directions. He doesn't even look up."|stage direction

EXT OUTDOOR MARKET - LATER
Tom and Summer shopping at the fruit market. Unless we were
looking for trouble we wouldn't see any. But since we are, we
might notice she lags behind him as they walk through the
aisles. His hands are in his pockets. He's bored. She's
distant. But only if we're really looking.

INT MOVIE - LATER
Tom and Summer watching the film. Tears begin to well in
Summer's eyes. They soon turn to audible sobs. Tom turns to
look at her, to offer some sort of comfort, believing it to
be a response to the movie. She doesn't look back.

Tom drawing a straight line on his wall. Redecorating."|stage direction

form. A pretty impressive looking futuristic skyscraper,
almost shaped like a tear drop.

Same day from the past. They walk out, at first everything's
alright. It's exactly as we saw on page 7. But soon after

In CU, Tom goes to hold Summer's hand. But something happens.
It could be a total coincidence, but just as his hand
approaches hers (in SLO-MO), she moves it away and keeps it
at her side. Tom puts his hands in his pockets, unsure if
there's something to read in that.

4. EXT SOCCER FIELD - DAY

6. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY
Tom getting bad news on the phone. He has a list written on
his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of
futuristic looking structures). He crosses ""Abrams and
Abrams"" off the list. We notice several others are also
crossed off.
5. EXT GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY
Tom has his car on the side of the road and is out measuring
the distance between the beams of the bridge.
8. EXT PARK - DAY
Tom jogs. A little faster this time.
9. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Tom getting more bad news from the answering machine,
crossing off yet another firm from the list. Few remain. He
sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. For a beat, lost
in thought."|stage direction

On the RIGHT, Summer. In her wedding dress. The veil is
lifted. And she's a bride.
