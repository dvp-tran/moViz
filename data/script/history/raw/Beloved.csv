field. The field stretches beyond, until a line of distant
woods stops it. Around the back of the house stands a rundown
STORAGE SHED, a cold house, a privy and a water pump. A porch
with a single door serves as the only entrance.
Camera begins a slow move toward the house as we;
SUPER - OHIO, 1865
WE HEAR SOUNDS from inside the house - BUMPS, A CHAIR FALLING

Bulgar races beside it as Howard reaches for him.

lasted here this long."|speech

country ain't packed to the rafters with
some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our
ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come
back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You
lucky. You got one child left, still
pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had
eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one
of them gone from me. Four taken, four
chased and all, I expect, worrying
somebody's house into evil. My first born
- alls I can remember of her now is how
she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her
little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they
slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight
children and that's all I remember."|speech

of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had
Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years...
My two girls, sold and gone before I
could even a heard about it, and them
without their grown up teeth yet. My
third child, my son after Halle...I let
that straw boss have me for four months
so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he
had him traded for lumber anyway and me
pregnant with his child. I couldn't love
that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the
rest either. God take what He
would....and He did..."|speech

here."|speech
51|BABY SUGGS|"Those boys didn't even know him. You had
six whole years of marriage to my Halle
Fathered every one of your children. A
blessing. I learned hard that a man's
just a man, but a son like that...like
Halle..now that's somebody."|speech

Sethe is pumping water into a bucket for clothes washing. A
gentle breeze carries a LEAF into the bucket. Sethe sees it
floating atop the water for a moment, then picks it up.
C.U. of SETHE as the image triggers a feeling - and the
feeling a memory - from long ago.
Sethe looks around her and finds she is no longer standing in
the barren field of 124...but rather-

down on groves and rows of gorgeous sycamores for as far as

hears something;
THE SOUND OF A WAGON'S WHEELS - rolling over a road, growing
louder, coming towards her"|stage direction

END OF MEMORY;"|stage direction

62||"A MAN driving a horse and wagon with two children in the
back, coming up Bluestone Road. He wears no hat.
Sethe breathes easily. She looks around her -the reality of
124's barren field has returned. The memory of Sweet Home's
sycamores have vanished.
Denver is playing near the road. As the wagon nears 124,
Denver looks up and smiles. The Man whips the horse hard so
as to ride past the house faster. The children stare at
Denver and 124, with horror and curiosity.
The stares of the children destroy Denver's smile. She
watches them go, then turns to hide her upset and sees her
mother watching her.
Sethe looks to Denver with empathy and impotence: wanting to
ease her daughter's pain and knowing full well she cannot.
Hurt and angry, Denver runs past Sethe, towards the woods."|stage direction

going.
She reaches FIVE BOXWOOD BUSHES planted in a ring. The tall
bushes stretch toward each other four feet off the ground,
forming a round, emerald room in the center, seven feet high,
with walls fifty inches thick of murmuring leaves.
This is Denver's private place. She bends low and crawls
through the leaves into the center. Once there, this lonely
child wipes away her tears and tries to pull herself
together. She lays her face against the cool earth."|stage direction

could talk to the baby ghost. Maybe make
her behave and then people won't be
scared of here no more."|speech
74|SETHE|I don't know.|speech
75|DENVER|Why won't she ever settle?|speech
76|SETHE|"She's mad like a baby gets mad. You
forgetting how little it is. She wasn't
even two years old when she died. Too
little to understand."|speech

on. Some things just stay."|speech
84|DENVER|What things?|speech
85|SETHE|"Like, the place I was at before here -
Sweet Home. Even if that whole farm and
every tree and blade of grass on it died -
it'll still be there. Waiting. And if you
go and stand in the place where it was,
what happened there once, will happen
again."|speech
86|DENVER|"If it's still there, waiting, that mean
nothing ever dies?"|speech
87|SETHE|"Nothing ever does. That's why I had to
get my children out. No matter what.
That's why you can never go there."|speech

that they whipped you and you run off
pregnant with me."|speech

coming down the back."|speech

reaches the porch, Paul disappears from view.
Sethe walks towards the front of the house. When she is

being sure that keeps him alive."|speech

dead and she felt each one go the very
