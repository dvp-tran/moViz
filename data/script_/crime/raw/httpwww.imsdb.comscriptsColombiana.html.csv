Sitting at the table, very still. Watching.
ANGLE ON HER MOTHER AND FATHER
Facing the front door, hands gripping their assault rifles,
sweat dripping down their faces, chests heaving, waiting,
waiting, to blow anyone who comes through the door to
kingdom come.
But they never get the chance because...
BBBBRRRRAAAAKKKKKK!!!!!!!!
Machine gun fire shatters the windows on both sides of the
room, tearing into their bodies before they even get one
shot off. Tearing the orchid plants there to shred.
Cat watches in mute disbelief, shocked, as her parents
bodies are riddled with heavy caliber rounds making them
twitch and dance like marionettes on wires. Their blood
splattering across the room, across her.
And then...
Silence. Silence so complete it is deafening in it's
absence of any sound. Cat just sits in her chair.
And then the door bursts open and four gunmen storm into
the room, their assault weapons trained on the only living
thing in the room.
Cat. Marco enters."|stage direction

Examines the frame Fabio dug the chip out of.

for you to have seen."|speech

of the dead, even tearing the heels off their shoes."|stage direction
149|MARCO|"Some things are too complicated
for a kid to understand. This is
one of them. But I am going to
try explain it and make it very
simple for you. So you understand.
Now, you know who Don Luis is?"|speech
150||"Cat responds, shakes her head yes. Her hand slips
imperceptibly under the table.
CLOSE ON HER HAND
Touches the handle of the knife taped there."|stage direction

159||"Cat looks from the bodies and back to Marco, no emotion in
her eyes."|stage direction
160|MARCO|"I know you are a smart girl. You
do well in school. So I know this
is not too complicated for you to
understand. Am I right?"|speech
161||Cat nods.|stage direction
162|MARCO|"Good. Now, your father had
something that belonged to Don
Luis. A little thing. No bigger
than..."|speech

is?"|speech
169||Cat nods.|stage direction
170|MARCO|"Well, if you give it to me, Don
Luis will be very grateful. And
very generous. He will make sure
that you are clothed, fed, and
sent to the very best school. You
will have everything you want."|speech
171|(MORE)|12.|speech
172|MARCO (CONT'D)|"But if you don't give it to him,
he will be very unhappy. And you
see what happens when he is not
happy, yes?"|speech
173||Cat nods yes.|stage direction
174|MARCO|"So why don't you just give that
little thing which belongs to him.
Will you do that?"|speech
175||"Cat hesitates for a moment, and then removes one hand from
underneath the table, her fist closed tight. Marco smiles,
kindly. He holds out his hand."|stage direction
176|MARCO|You are a smart girl.|speech
177||Marco opens his hand.|stage direction
178|MARCO|"And in this life, smart girls get
everything they want. What do you

CLOSE ON HER OTHER HAND
Under the table, gripping the handle of the knife taped
there."|stage direction
180|MARCO|"Just tell me sweetheart...what do
you want?"|speech
181||"In a flash, the knife is whipped out and buried into Marco's
unsuspecting, open palm. Driven with such force, the knife
pierces through the back of his hand, and sticks into the
table beneath; pinning his hand. Marco wants to scream
but there is so much pain, nothing escapes his throat."|stage direction
182|CAT|"(in his ear)
To kill Don Luis!"|speech

188||"As she runs through the rooms of the house, sprints to the
bathroom where one foot hits the toilet, springing her
onto the ledge of a very small window. As she looks back,
she sees the gunmen in hot pursuit. And she jumps, head
first. Barely squeezing her small frame through the tiny
window.
And she drops...
Six feet down, onto a ledge, that is just beneath the
window. She flattens against the wall, holding onto the
medal of her father.
ON THE BATHROOM
One of the gunman comes to the window, cannot fit through,
looks out, does not see anybody across, then hears something
beneath him, looks down, sees the tip of a shoe below.
Puts his gun out the window, points it down, and....
BBBBRRRRAAAAKKKKKKK!!!!!!
Lets loose with a barrage from his weapon."|stage direction

barrage stops.

in..."|stage direction
191||ON CAT|location
192||"She hears the pause. Looks out over the sprawl of houses
that stretch up and down the steep hillsides of the favela.
She looks down at her open palm at the small chip her father
gave her. Pops the chip in her mouth, swallows, leaps
over the small divide between her house and the next roof,
and takes off running.
ON THE GUNMAN
Gets the clip to fit, sees Cat heading off across the roof,
out in the open, exposed, vulnerable. He lifts his gun to
shoot, when the gun muzzle is slammed up, peppers the
ceiling with bullets. The gunman turns to Marco, holding
his bloody rag wrapped hand."|stage direction

She sprints across to a small door. She kicks at the door,
which gives way and enters...
AN OPEN COURTYARD
Where a half dozen women are doing laundry by an open tap.
They look up to the sight of this little girl in the blood
splattered school uniform, do not say a word. And neither
does Cat. She just runs through to a small gate on the
far side of the courtyard, opens it, and disappears. One
of the women casually hangs one of her wet sheets over the
gate, hiding it.
ON THE GUNMEN
They crash through the vegetable garden. The old man deftly
kicks a rake leaning against the wall. It falls in between
the rows of tomato vines.
When the gunmen sprint through, the first one trips over
the rake, goes crashing through the vines, which causes
the two men behind him to also trip and fall. The fourth
man hurdles his fallen cohorts, bounds over the roof.
And the fifth man, looks at the old man. Knows what he
has done. Shoots him dead before jumping off the roof."|stage direction

outside their homes, chatting, playing dominoes.
At the end of the alley, two motorcycles appear. The riders
see Cat, as she sees them. They turn their bikes into the
alley...
VRROOOM!
And bear down on Cat.
Cat sprints back up the hill. She goes to escape into one
of the open doors, but she finds that one after another
the doors have closed shut, the people fled inside.
The bikes eat up the hill. Cat's legs are no match for
them. It seems she will be caught any second. She ducks
down a street where laundry is hung on a concealed metal
pipe running the length of the alley. As Cat ducks through
the sheets the gunmen gun their bikes right towards her,
tear through the sheets...
AND THE CONCEALED METAL PIPE CATCHES THEM ACROSS THEIR
THROATS."|stage direction
