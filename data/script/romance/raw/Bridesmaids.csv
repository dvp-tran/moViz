Products everywhere, too many hair-flips, eye-cream, no
hair out of place.
She walks into the bedroom, where TED, a gorgeous man
sleeps. She sneaks back into the bed, carefully
positioning herself and moving the sheets to show her
good parts.
She coughs and nudges Ted to wake him up then pretend
sleeps."|speech

that, because isn't that what everyone

science. I'm-I don't want a relationship
either. Let's just say that. And I
wouldn't even care whatever you do or I

64|LILLIAN|"OK, so you had a first date last night.
Did you bring him a present?
Annie is silent.

making them anyway, as a friend. Yo're

DOUGIE (O.S)
I just chipped a nail!"|speech

92|DONNA|"She was paralyzed Annie, had no feeling
in her legs, and then one day after years
of believing in herself, she stood up out
of that chair and tap-danced for the

makes a real effort around here. He
connects with the customer. And when he
wants to make a sale, he goes for it."|speech
93|ANNIE|Okay. (beat) I do want it.|speech
94|DONNA|"(smiling) Good. Showing up on time is a
wonderful place to start.
Donna talks to herself and gathers her things.

some people I know who are considered
dogs, you know, they have a good
personality, and are better looking to

better ones.

HELEN (CONT'D)
I had to come into Milwaukee for a
charity luncheon right down the street
and I thought I'd come in and say hi."|speech
623|ANNIE|Hi!|speech
624|HELEN|"And as the leader of the bridesmaids, I
thought it'd be fun to pick up some
little gifts for all the girls."|speech

that technically be me? Honor?"|speech
626|HELEN|"Well, no, sweetie, you're the Maid of
Honor, and we're all bridesmaids, and out
of all of us, I'm the leader. Anyway, it
doesn't matter. Um, I wanted to get
something that we could wear to the
rehearsal dinner or something. That would
be fun. Where are the diamonds?"|speech

tortoise-shell handled sterling silver

Thanks."|speech

package from your mom."|speech
635|ANNIE|"Hey thanks for saving my butt today. Like
I said I'll pay you back as soon as I
can.
She opens the package. And pulls out a red blazer."|speech

in when it gets to a quarter tank.
Especially cause you have such a shitty
car."|speech
637|ANNIE|"Thanks. Can I ask you a question? What do
you think of Vegas?"|speech
638|STEVE|"Ooo. Let me turn this off. Vegas is a
black hole but I must have it in my life.
Does that make sense?"|speech
639|ANNIE|"I'm just asking because some of the girls
are talking about going for Lillia's
bachelorette party and I've never been.
64."|speech
640|STEVE|"Oh no. Now I don't know about weddings.
When you go on a bachelorette, does the
bride pay?"|speech
641|ANNIE|"No, everyone pays for themselves. And you
pay for the bride."|speech
642|STEVE|"Ok, I'm gonna say no. You cannot afford
that. Vegas is not cheap. Airfare,
hotels, food, cars, drinks, clubs, show
tickets. Remember this morning? You
cannot afford Vegas."|speech
643|ANNIE|Well, I could save up for it.|speech
644|STEVE|"No, you need to win a contest to go to
Vegas/You had gum for lunch yesterday.
Ooh, ‚ÄúNight Moves.‚Äù Can I have this?
A lightbulb goes off in Annie's head. Steve holds the
blazer out and reads the tag."|speech

candles. There are too many flames."|speech
650|HELEN|I just got your e-mail. Um...Sea World?|speech
651|ANNIE|"Well it's not just Sea World. It's a
weekend in Florida. See, when Lillian and
I were kids we went there and she loved
it and has always talked about going
back. Ask Dougie. I think it would really
mean a lot to her. We could stay at my
Dad's house, he won't even be there. Then
we could go out at night and got to the
beach and then Sea World on one of the
days."|speech
652|HELEN|But a bachelorette at Sea World?|speech

bachelorette."|speech

660|BECCA|"It's super old though! They have awesome

have to pay. (to the kids) Tyler stop it,

money shouldn't be a problem if Lillian's
our friend."|speech
689|ANNIE|"Oh no, no, I was just thinking about
everyone else. That's all I'm saying."|speech
690|MEGAN|"What I'm saying is, they drop you off in
the middle of the desert. You have to
kill your own food and find your way
back. Not everyone makes it. Seriously.

1282|HELEN|Well, it's closed is all I'm just saying.|speech
1283|MEGAN|"Maybe she flew somewhere. Everyone always
hides in Mexico."|speech
1284|BECCA|"I don't think she'd leave the country.
Maybe she went to the reservoir."|speech
1285|HELEN|"Why would she go to the reservoir? Its
just a big tank of water."|speech
1286|DANA|"Ernie and I sometimes go for our morning
walk there. It's the next best thing to a
lake."|speech

1292|BECCA|I'm think I'm getting carsick.|speech
1293|HELEN|"Is that supposed to be a dig on my
driving?"|speech
1294|DANA|Well you do speed up and slow down a lot.|speech
1295|HELEN|"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't take a stunt
driving course in Renegade missions."|speech
1296|BECCA|"Why do you always have to be so
condescending?
123."|speech
1297|LESLIE|Yeah, its getting really old.|speech
1298|HELEN|I was being funny!|speech
1299|DANA|Well it came out a little mean Helen.|speech
1300|HELEN|"Dana who's side are you on?
All the girls start yelling. Helen loses control of the
car for a split second and drives off the road hitting
something. BOOM! The girls scream!!! She pulls over. All
the girls are wide eyed and speechless."|speech
1301|BECCA|What was that?|speech
1302|DANA|Did we hit something!?|speech
1303|HELEN|Was it a person?|speech
1304|ANNIE|"Guys it's just a flat. I've gotten tons
of them.
Annie goes to get out of the car."|speech
1305|BECCA/DANA|"No!/ Annie don't get out!/ It's pitch
dark out."|speech
1306|HELEN|Everybody calm down. I'm calling 911.|speech
1307|LESLIE|"You don't call 911 for a flat tire!
A huge truck drives by moving their car a little bit.
The girls SCREAM!"|speech
1308|ANNIE|"Guys! We're fine. Helen, put the hazards
on.
Helen puts them on.
124."|speech
1309|LESLIE|I'm calling AAA.|speech
1310|BECCA|I'm calling Kevin!|speech
1311|ANNIE|Helen, do you have a jack?|speech
1312|HELEN|Probably?!|speech
1313|DANA|"What if we get hit just sitting here? Or
kidnapped or chased by an animal?"|speech
1314|ANNIE|Dana calm down.|speech
1315|LESLIE|Shit! I don't have any service.|speech
1316|BECCA|Me neither!|speech
1317|DANA|"Oh my God! We're gonna die...
Annie has had enough and gets out.
The tire is definitely flat. She opens Hele's trunk,
lifts the bottom (wherever the jack is in an Escalade]
She goes up to the window."|speech
1318||INT. HELEN'S ESCALADE. CONTINUOUS.|location
1319|ANNIE|"Everyone's gotta get out, if you want me
to fix this.
They complain that its dangerous, i's cold, but they do.
Annie puts the jack under car."|speech
1320|LESLIE|So, how can I help?|speech
1321|ANNIE|"Hold the flashlight.
Leslie and Megan watch as Annie pumps the jack. She
really does know what she's doing! The car is raising.
125.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
Megan hand me the wrench.
Megan hands it to her. Annie starts to unscrew the lug
nuts handing them to Megan, with Leslie by her side.
Dana and Becca stand with Helen."|speech
1322|DANA|"That's pretty cool she knows how to do
change a tire."|speech
1323|BECCA|"I know. I can't believe she's doing it.
Dana and Becca move over to Annie. Helen waits alone."|speech
1324|HELEN|"Just don't scratch anything.
The girls are all crouched down to watch Annie in awe."|speech
1325|DANA|So what are you doing now?|speech
1326|ANNIE|"I'm removing the lug nuts so we can take
the tire off."|speech
1327|BECCA|"How does that little thing lift the whole
car?"|speech
1328|MEGAN|"It uses hydraulic power. It gives a human
being the lifting capacity of 1.5 to
three tons."|speech
1329|LESLIE|How do you know this stuff?|speech
1330|MEGAN|"I like cars. There's a real artistry to
them."|speech
1331|HELEN|"Are you guys working or talking? We do't
have all night."|speech
1332|DANA|"(quickly) Annie is doing the best she can
Helen. So why don't you just stand over
there and be quiet and wait.
126.
Everyone's speechless."|speech
1333|HELEN|"Excuse me?!
Dana stands. She has had it with Helen."|speech
1334|DANA|"I said, will you, for once, shut the fuck
up!!!??
Dana approaches Helen. The other girls are standing now.
DANA (CONT'D)
Lillian probably left because of you
anyway."|speech
1335|HELEN|What!?|speech
1336|DANA|"You're so- bossy! You've been acting like
you're in charge this whole time! Do't
you realize how much pressure sh's
under? You know, Lillian did not want to
leave her reception in a unicorn-drawn
carriage?! She said ‚ÄúThat's not me.‚Äù And
you ordered it anyway! You've been
pushing her this whole time! Annie was
right."|speech
1337|MEGAN|"Yeah!
Helen glares at Megan."|speech
1338|HELEN|"What are you talking about? The only
reason you're even in this wedding is
because you're the groom's sister.
Weirdo."|speech
1339|MEGAN|"I'd rather be the groom's sister than
have cameltoe from my $600 pants.
We see that Helen has cameltoe. Megan has surprised them."|speech
1340|HELEN|"Why is everyone attacking me? I wasn't
the one who caused a huge scene at
Lillian's bridal shower and made her cry.
127.
Everyone looks at Annie."|speech
1341|LESLIE|"I hate to interrupt this riveting
discussion but a really creepy guy in a
Trans Am just pulled over.
The guy gets out of the car. He is thirty-ish, wears at-
shirt with a cat on it and camouflage shorts.
TRANS AM MAN
Hey it's pretty late. What are you ladies
doing?
Becca and Dana scramble into the woods. Leslie gets
behind the car."|speech
1342|ANNIE|"Just changing the tire.
TRANS AM MAN
You guys need some man hands for that?"|speech
1343|ANNIE|"Nope I think we got it. But thank you.
He doesn't leave, the girls worriedly look at each other.
TRANS AM MAN
Look, if you guys get tired, I live right
up that hill. You ladies can just leave
your car here, come on up and let us all
lay down together.
He starts to walk toward them. The girls are scared.
Annie gives Megan a look. Megan tries to distract him."|speech
1344|MEGAN|"Hey! Are those snowflake rims?
The guy looks at Megan.
TRANS AM MAN
Yeah, found ‚Äòem in a junk yard. Restored
‚Äòem myself."|speech
1345|MEGAN|"I bet you got a formula 4OO under there?
TRANS AM MAN
Well, well. Someone knows her cars.
128."|speech
1346|MEGAN|"I'm in the Firebird club.
TRANS AM MAN
You don't say. I never met a lady in the
FBC before.
He walks over to Megan, she gives Annie a nod. Annie
rushes to the tire and quickly continues changing it."|speech
1347|MEGAN|"You ever make it up to the Trans Am
Nationals in Dayton?
Becca, Dana, Leslie and Helen are huddled together. They
talk in a loud whisper."|speech
1348|BECCA|What's happening? What's happening?|speech
1349|DANA|I can hear animals.|speech
1350|BECCA|"Be quiet!
The guy is moving closer to Megan."|speech
1351|MEGAN|"Remember Smokey and the Bandit?
TRANS AM MAN
It's my favorite movie. ‚ÄúGive me a Diablo
sandwich and a Dr. Pepper and make it
quick . I'm in a goddamn hurry.‚Äù
He leans into her."|speech
1352|MEGAN|"Why don't you show me what's under the
hood?
Back at Helen's car. Leslie sneaks over to Annie."|speech
1353|LESLIE|How's it comin'?|speech
1354|ANNIE|"Almost there.
The guy has lifted up his hood and Mega's looking. He
puts his hands on her ass.
129.
TRANS AM MAN
You wanna get in the backseat?"|speech
1355|MEGAN|"Uh...
He is really getting aggressive, pushing against her.
MEGAN (CONT'D)
Hey take it easy!
HELEN (O.S.)
Hey what about me?
He turns around to be hit with a huge piece of wood by
Helen. He falls."|speech
1356|DANA|"Oh my God!!
Annie is frantically releasing the jack."|speech
1357|ANNIE|"OK, everybody in the car! Get in! Megan,
Helen let's go!
All the girls scramble in the car, Helen starts it. Annie
is finishing.
TRANS AM MAN
Hey you!"|speech
1358|HELEN|"Annie get in!
TRANS AM MAN
I'm gonna get you bitches!!
He is coming towards Annie! She turns towards him with
the jack."|speech
1359|ANNIE|"Back away! Or I will shove this Jack so
far down your throat you will shit
out...your fucking..face!
TRANS AM MAN
Whoa, whoa. Alright. Alright. I'm
leaving."|speech
1360|ANNIE|"Get out!
130.
TRANS AM MAN
I am! I live up the hill though if you
change your mind.
Annie backs up and jumps in the car. Helen peels away.
The girls drive away fast."|speech
1361|CONTINUOUS|The girls still driving. Megan's eating chips.|speech
1362|LESLIE|"Megan I was freaked out when he leaned up
against you. That was a pretty gutsy
move."|speech
1363|MEGAN|"Annie's the one who tried to make him eat
a car jack."|speech
1364|ANNIE|"Helen hit him over the head with a tree.
They all continue talking, Helen and Annie smile.
ANNIE (CONT'D)
There it is, turn left up here. Go down
the little hill. Ok, that's the driveway.
It's dark and very rustic. It's LILLIAN'S LAKE HOUSE FROM
THE FLASHBACK. Where Lillian and Dougie met."|speech
1365|LESLIE|God I haven't been here in forever.|speech
1366|ANNIE|"The house is right up here.
They pull up to a small cottage and get out of the car."|speech
1367|HELEN|Her car's not here.|speech
1368|DANA|Doesn't look like any lights are on.|speech
1369|BECCA|"She's not here.
Annie is sitting on the front step, defeated.
131."|speech
1370|ANNIE|"I thought she'd be here. I really thought
she'd be here. I'm sorry."|speech
1371|DANA|Annie, it's ok.|speech
1372|ANNIE|"No, it's not. I don't know what happened.
I messed everything up. Lillia's not
even talking to me. I think I'm so afraid
to see what's really happening.
Lillian's moving on to this great life
and I feel left behind. And know matter
how hard I try, I don't fit in to her
life now.
Everyone is silent."|speech
1373|HELEN|"Annie, Lillian loves you. (beat] I know I
haven't made things easy for you.. I
don't have a life and I am bored. Perry
is always away and I'm constantly alone
and she's been there. And I've been a
bridesmaid nine times and although I may
have implied it, I....I've never been a
Maid of Honor. I wanted to make
everything special for Lillian because...
I don't have a lot of friends. I wanted
her to like me better and to impress her,
and everyone else. And I'm just good at
throwing parties. I always have been. In
fact sometimes I think people only ask me
to be in their wedding's because of that."|speech
1374|ANNIE|"Lillian wouldn't do that. If she asked
you to be in her wedding it's because you
are her friend. Trust me.
Dana is crying and takes a picture. The're both startled
by the flash."|speech
1375|HELEN|I'm sorry about the Sea World tickets.|speech
1376|ANNIE|"I'm sorry that when I left the shower I
told your neighbors you were shooting a
porn.

1377|HELEN|Oh, I didn't know that you did that.|speech
1378|ANNIE|Oh, well, sorry.|speech
1379|HELEN|I deserved it.|speech
1380|ANNIE|"I must say you do put on some pretty
spectacular events."|speech
1381|HELEN|"Well, I'm really rich.
They smile."|speech
1382|ANNIE|It is getting pretty late.|speech
1383|DANA|What should we do about Lillian?|speech

1389|ANNIE|It's okay. I really am sorry.|speech
1390|LILLIAN|"I'm sorry too. I didnt want things to
turn out like this. I got so caught up in

one day to be perfect."|speech

1397|ANNIE|I know.|speech
1398|LILLIAN|"I just wish the wedding hadnt become
about everything and everyone else but me
and Dougie. And now, it's become this
thing I never wanted. I did want simple.
I wanted colored lanterns, twinkly lights
and food everywhere. I wanted a DJ to
play all those stupid wedding songs."|speech
1399|ANNIE|It's not too late to have those things.|speech
1400|LILLIAN|"I'm sorry I didn't know all the stuff you
were going through too.
Annie is clearly sad."|speech

candles. Annie is all smiles and walks up to him."|speech

the name of this place, I called them up,
told them I was a cop calling on official
police business, doing a very big
investigation and uh, made them tell me
all the weddings they had planned for the
next two months with a bride named
Lillian. [ALT: I'm a cop]
