6||"The place is Gotham City. The time, 1987 -- once removed.
The city of Tomorrow: stark angles, creeping shadows,
dense, crowded, airless, a random tangle of steel and
concrete, self-generating, almost subterranean in its
aspect... as if hell had erupted through the sidewalks and
kept on growing. A dangling fat moon shines overhead, ready
to burst."|stage direction
7||EXT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT|location
8||"Amid the chrome and glass sits a dark and ornate Gothic
anomaly: old City Cathedral, once grand, now abandoned --
long since boarded up and scheduled for demolition.
On the rooftop far above us, STONE GARGOYLES gaze down from
their shadowy, windswept perches, keeping monstrous watch
over the distant streets below, sightless guardians of the
Gotham night.
One of them is moving."|stage direction
9||EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT|location

A TOURIST FAMILY, Mom, Dad, and little Jimmy, staring
straight  ahead as they march in perfect lockstep down the

over; the respectable theatre crowd has thinned out, and
now -- Playbills in hand -- they find themselves adrift in

Mercifully, the DERELICT doesn't seem to be following.
They pick up their pace. They don't see the SHADOWY FIGURE
in the alleyway. They don't see the GUN until a gloved hand
brings it down, butt-first, across the back of DAD's neck.
DAD crumples. MOM grabs JIMMY and backs up against a brick
wall, too terrified to scream. The DERELICT races across
the street to join his confederate, the STREET PUNK, who's
already searching for DAD's wallet.
MOM's mouth opens in panic. They can see she's about to
snap -- so  the STREET PUNK, still in a crouch, trains his
gun on JIMMY."|stage direction

BOOTS CRUNCHING ON GRAVEL. They turn slowly. Their JAWS
DROP.
Standing at the edge of the roof, bathed in moonlight, is a
BLACK APPARITION. IT DOES NOT MOVE.
EDDIE stands rooted to the spot, a choked gurgle in his
throat, as if he's just seen his own death. The BLACK
FIGURE advances, spreading  its arms. Or rather, its WINGS:
GREAT BLACK BATWINGS, flapping in the wind.
NICK drops to the gravel, gropes for the gun, brings it up.
And still the BLACK FIGURE draws closer, deliberate,
menacing. On its chest: THE EMBLEM OF A BAT, in an oval
yellow field, glowing like a target in the darkness...
NICK FIRES TWICE. TWO CLEAN HITS. The strange black figure
is knocked bodily to the roof.
Trembling, sweating buckets, NICK gets to his feet. He
whacks a motionless EDDIE on the arm --"|stage direction
81|NICK (cont.)|I'm gettin' outta here.|speech
82||"-- and bends to retrieve his loot. EDDIE lets out a
strange, pre-verbal squeal...
... and NICK sees THE HUMAN BAT, BACK ON ITS FEET,
NIGHTMARISH, UNDEAD, MOVING SLOWLY AND INEVITABLY CLOSER.
Panic. Sheer, raw, unrelenting panic. Stolen money flutters
out of NICK's hands. He scuttles around the periphery of
the roof, his feet skidding on the gravel as he searches
for a way down. The BLACK SPECTRE is blocking his path to
the fire escape. Trapped like a rat, NICK FIRES WILDLY.
EDDIE is frozen in place, his eyes glazed over, his face
drained of blood. The BAT treads calmly past. A LEG snakes
out. A BLACK BOOT catches EDDIE high on the chest --
-- LIFTS HIM CLEANLY OFF HIS FEET --
-- AND SENDS HIM FLYING THROUGH THE AIR. EDDIE slams into a
brick chimney and slumps to the roof unconscious, a broken,
weightless puppet.
THIS ACTION IS SO SMOOTH, SO AUTOMATIC, THAT THE BAT DOES
NOT EVEN BREAK HIS STRIDE. NICK sees his chance and CHARGES
past the black wraith, scrambling toward the fire escape...
A GLOVED HAND slices through the air, and NICK pitches
forward, his legs ensnared in a tangle of WIRES. Screaming
now, he drags himself across the gravel roof, the looming
figure of the BAT at his heels...
... until there's no place left to go. NICK cowers against
the ledge, his pants torn, his hands and knees bloody. He
has dissolved into total mindless hysteria.
Almost by reflex, NICK keeps shooting. He'd do better if he
could manage to open his eyes. By now the hammer is falling
on an empty chamber, but NICK continues, obsessively, to
pull the trigger. He weeps; he moans; he wails...
THE BAT grabs a fistful of NICK's shirt, and with
supernatural ease HOISTS HIM into the air."|stage direction
83|NICK (cont.)|Don't kill me... don't kill me...|speech
84||"When NICK finally opens his eyes, he realizes THE BAT is
standing on the ledge of the roof -- HOLDING HIM OUT, at
arm's length, over six stories of nothingness.
The gruesome black apparition speaks, in a rasping whisper:"|stage direction
85|BATMAN|"I won't kill you. I want you to do
me a favor."|speech

He looks up. And sees, in the mirrored lenses where
BATMAN's eyes should be, the twin reflections of his own
stricken face."|stage direction
87|BATMAN (cont.)|"Tell your friends. Tell all your
friends."|speech
88||"NICK HOWLS. Almost as an afterthought, THE BATMAN heaves
him roughly back onto the roof. And then -- casually,
without a moment's hesitation -- STEPS OFF THE LEDGE OF THE
ROOF, INTO MIDAIR.
Trembling, NICK crawls to the ledge and looks over...
finding ABSOLUTELY NO TRACE of the Batman.
NICK is still screaming as we PAN UP to the bilious yellow
globe of Gotham's moon. MAIN CREDITS ROLL:"|stage direction

liquid, weightless figures moving in a tinted, soundless
cityscape as DISTANT, TINKLY CARNIVAL MUSIC plays
underneath. We're outside a theatre watching first-nighters
emerge from the opening of a hit musical.
In the crowd we pick out THREE FIGURES: DR. THOMAS WAYNE,
his wife MARTHA, and -- in THOMAS's arms -- their young son
BRUCE. BRUCE hasn't made it through the show. He's asleep,
head nestled peacefully against his father's shoulder.
THOMAS rouses the boy gently, sets him down on the
sidewalk. BRUCE rubs the sleep from his eyes as THOMAS puts
an arm around his wife. Together they begin walking.
IN A SINGLE CUT the crowd has DISAPPEARED, and the WAYNES
are walking toward us up a deserted street. THOMAS and
MARTHA are laughing, making jokes, reaching down to tousle
BRUCE's hair. Their FACES, as they draw closer, are FULL OF
JOY. And then, without warning --
A HANDGUN enters frame.
The WAYNES freeze in their tracks. THOMAS steps
protectively in front of his wife, reaches for his wallet,
begins unbuckling his watch. He won't put up a fight.
MARTHA's hand goes involuntarily to the PEARL NECKLACE at
her throat.
The GUNMAN sees it, gestures for her to hand it over. But
MARTHA is paralyzed, afraid to move.
The GUNMAN steps past THOMAS, SNATCHES AT THE NECKLACE.
The instant his wife is threatened, THOMAS ATTACKS. The
pearl strand BREAKS in the GUNMAN'S HAND as he drops toward
the sidewalk.
A SILENT BURST OF FLAME erupts from the muzzle of the gun.
THOMAS CRUMPLES. MARTHA emits a PIERCING SHRIEK -- a shriek
we cannot hear --
-- a shriek cut short by a second burst of flame.
BRUCE stands paralyzed in shock. THE GUNMAN scoops a
handful of pearls off the sidewalk, reaches for MARTHA's
purse, and rises slowly -- his gun levelled directly at the
boy.
Almost catatonic, BRUCE stares down at the corpses of his
parents. At their hands, somehow intertwined. At the tiny
glinting pearls and the spreading pool of blood around
them.
He looks up with a gaze so bleak, so petrifying... that the
GUNMAN turns and runs.
AND WE CUT. To an exact reproduction of the Pulitzer Prize-
winning photo... the cops bent over the bodies, the medics
with their stretchers, the boy BRUCE, his arms wrapped
tightly around the waist of OFFICER GORDON.
