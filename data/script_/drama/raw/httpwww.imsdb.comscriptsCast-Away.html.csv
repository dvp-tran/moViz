A plume of dust comes into frame.  The dust is from a TRUCK,
orange and white and violet, with ""FedEx"" blazoned across the
side.
The truck turns into a collection of ramshackle World War II
era Quonset huts and outbuildings.  Around the outbuildings
are large sculptures of wood and metal."|stage direction

7||"The door is opened by a WOMAN in her late twenties.  Hair
pulled back, casual, an artist.  She hands the DRIVER a FedEx
BOX which is decorated with a drawing of two ANGEL WINGS.
The Driver has a hand-held computer; a portable printer
dangles from his belt.
The Driver scans the package with his hand-held computer,
prints out a label and sticks it on the Box, ready to go.
But something on the box catches her eye.  She wants it back.
He glances at his watch.  She draws RINGS around the Wings,
uniting them.  She gives the box to the Driver, then hands
him a cup of coffee.  They've done this before.
He takes a sip of the coffee, then runs for the truck.  He
jumps in and heads back onto the plains."|stage direction

dolly and loads it into a CONTAINER with clear plastic sides.
A female Loader slaps a large bar code label on the
container, scans it, then pulls the container across a belt
of rollers onto a larger truck.  The doors of the truck
close.  The latch slams down.
A forklift hoists the container to the cargo doors of a 737."|stage direction

Five thousand people work in a frenzy of interconnected
activity inside three vast hangers brightly lit.  Hundreds of
forklifts and cargo-pullers dart about, their headlights
crisscrossing like a laser show.
Loaders quickly roll the container onto a FORKLIFT."|stage direction

BELT, where our Box is spilled into a Mississippi River of
packages, HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of them, all shapes and
sizes, from shoe boxes to engine blocks.  Large mechanical
arms divert the immense flow of Workers at dozens of
stations.  The packages surge and move.
The Workers place the packages label-side-up on new belts,
where they're scanned by laser readers.  Picking up speed our
Box is shunted across the acres of interlocking belts.
The Box ends up in a much larger CONTAINER labeled CDG."|stage direction

Chuck.
The tide gently rocks him, laps at his face.  He chokes.
Slowly he gets to his knees.  Vomits seawater, big heaves.
He rolls over, sits down.  Dazed.  Still confused.  Where am
I?  What happened?
Chuck's first instinct is to check the time.  He looks at his
watch, taps it in frustration.
Then he looks around, and we look with him.

thickets leading back into a thickly wooded valley climbing

wave?  A jolt of adrenaline courses through Chuck's body.  He
lurches to his feet.
We HEAR the noises again.  Chuck edges toward the rocks at
the barb of the hook.  Keeping his eye on the thicket, he
bends down and picks up a stone.  His first weapon.
In the rocks he finds a piece of driftwood.  He picks it up
in his other hand.  He backs between two rocks and stands

He throws it down on a rock.  The coconut just bounces off.
He wedges the coconut between two rocks, then throws a rock
down on it.  It bounces off.  He throws down a bigger rock.

him."|stage direction

up another rock and strikes the first one.  Then again,
harder.  And again.  A large flake shoots off.  This edge is
even sharper.

Chuck uses the stone knife to saw at the coconut.  No luck.
Chuck clumsily sharpens a stick with the sharp rock.
Chuck brings the sharpened stick down hard on the coconut,

Chuck positions the stick, pointed end up, in a hole, then
SLAMS the coconut down hard on it.  Success!  The green nut

smashes the nut with a rock, but -- OW!  -- he hits his hand!

made of videotape and woven fiber.  Necklaces of shark's
teeth and shells hang from his neck.  His hair is long.  A
coconut frond hat is on his head.

activity and energy, surrounded by technology and human
activity at its most intense, devoted to making seconds
count.  Now he is utterly alone, and utterly still.
And now he has all the time in the world.

1784||"Chuck sits back on the couch, taking in the sight of the
ocean in the light rain.  He looks over at all the canvases,
the easel, the palettes.  The wind rustles the palm trees
around the house.  The surf crashes and rustles.  Familiar
sounds.  Island sounds.
He relaxes a little.  Maybe the package with the wings was a
sign, he kept it all these years precisely for this.  Then
there's a sound of a truck in the driveway.
The engine cuts off.  There are steps on the porch.  The door
opens.  A tanned muscular MAN in neatly kept work clothes
comes in, hangs a tool belt on a hook by the door.
He looks at Chuck with a relaxed, even stare, as if seeing a
man in a FedEx uniform sitting on his couch is not an unusual
occurrence."|stage direction
