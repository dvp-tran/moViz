FADE IN"|unknown
1||INT. BARGE - DAY|location
2||"Crewman EPPS (29), wearing a life vest and tool belt, jumps
down into the darkness. She stands in a great hollow cavern,
oily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel
and WATER MOVING OVER ITS HULL on the other side."|stage direction
3||INT. BARGE - LATER - DAY|location
4||"Epps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light
on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead. She
kneels. As the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking
in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull."|stage direction
5||EXT. BARGE - LATER - DAY|location
6||"Epps pulls herself onto the deck from below. She stands on a
rusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean
by a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable.
It is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which
means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north-
west.  She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way
forward."|stage direction
7||EXT. BARGE - BOW - MOMENTS LATER - DAY|location
8||"Up ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey-black clouds of diesel
smoke rising from its massive turbine vents.
Epps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and
professional. The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific
Northwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her
true calling now. And under some grime, several polypro shirts
and a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be
considered pretty.
She clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches
to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. She climbs onto
the cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the
bow beneath her. She pulls herself forward on a roller bearing
that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward
the tug at the other end."|stage direction
9||EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - DAY|location
10||"DODGE and GREER look on from the stern, where the boat's
name ""Arctic Warrior"" is emblazoned on the transom. Dodge
(37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy
coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate
Texan and former merchant marine. GREER (42), is the boat's
first mate, African American, originally from some sweltering
red-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the
north.
They watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable
occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a
passing swell slackens it. Epps pulls herself to the stern
where the cable winds into a tow anchor."|stage direction
11|EPPS|It's a slow leak.|speech
12||She unclips and drops to the deck.|stage direction
13|GREER|What's slow?|speech
14|EPPS|Maybe twenty gallons an hour.|speech
15|DODGE|Where from?|speech

Just under the waterline. I don't
think it's a problem."|speech

it's a problem."|speech

19||INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY|location
20||"The view from the pilothouse commands 360 degrees as radar
and GPS navigation displays glow. MURPHY, the ship's master,
pilots the boat. He is 48, at sea all his adult life, and
most of the rest, a fact written on his face and one that
every crewman who's ever worked for him has been willing to
bet his life on. A walkie-talkie CRACKLES AWAKE."|stage direction

at him from the stern."|stage direction
25|GREER|"The number nine on the starboard
side's half flooded. Epps says it's
a slow leak just under the waterline,
about twenty gallons an hour. They
must've pumped it before we left
Sitka."|speech
26|MURPHY|Of course they did.|speech
27|GREER|Let the buyer beware.|speech
28|MURPHY|What do you say, Dodge?|speech
29||(taking the radio)|location
30|DODGE (V.O. RADIO)|"If it started out at twenty an hour

then we see. After my guy looks at
it."|speech
52||INT. VASILI'S OFFICE - DAY|location

the middle of the Bering Sea. Epps lines up a shot at the
pool table as a couple of SEAMEN check out her ass and a
tattoo of Wiley Coyote poking out of her pants. Greer reads
a paper near-by.
Murphy enters, crossing to the bar where Dodge nurses a beer
and a cigarette. Murphy throws down an envelope with Dodge's
name on it. Dodge picks it up, thumbs through a thick stack
of hundreds."|stage direction

68||INT. BAR - LATER - NIGHT|location

way through to the bar, a cigarette dangling from her mouth.
She buys two beers and pays the BARTENDER from her envelope
of cash. She takes the beers back to the far wall where a
young off-duty COASTGUARDSMAN stands. He takes one, they
laugh.
AT A TABLE
Beers, cigarettes and pay envelopes on the table before them,
Dodge, Greer and Murphy look on at Epps across the room, who

trouble?"|speech

ignore you. Epps, let's go."|speech

your paws off me, Tarzan."|speech

100||"Or WHACK! Murphy can't help but wince as a pool cue breaks
in two over the Riveter's head.
Dodge, cigarette in his mouth, takes a look at the cue half
he still holds, shaking his head.
The Riveter's hands fall from Murphy's collar and his legs
buckle. Some of his BUDDIES hold him up as Greer reminds
some of the others he's holding a pool cue of his own."|stage direction

thousand ton ship you're talking
about."|speech

size."|speech

coming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see

All but it's minute hand has fallen off its corroded face,

comes to it. She lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to

Epps steps in. She kneels, shining the light closer. The
yellow glint is metal. Epps pulls back a slat, sliding away
some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram
ingot of gold.
She reaches out. She raises it, completely untouched by the

She turns, shinning her light back from where she came.
Nothing moves. Not a sound, but for her breathing and maybe
her heart pounding in her chest. ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS, again
echoing distantly in the silence. She shines her light through
the line of burners. Nothing moves.
Epps moves quietly between the burners. She comes to a massive
watertight door at the bulkhead. She steps through, finding
herself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks.
THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping.
She moves on, cautiously walking between the tanks, holding
her light out before her. She comes to the end of the
compartment and another bulkhead. The BOOMING SOUNDS, still
closer. She turns the light into the recesses, showing rusting
machinery and a stack of oil drums.
She approaches, holding the shotgun up. As she nears, the
BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN. She stops. It is coming from here.
She tenses, raising the shotgun, holding the light as steady
as she can manage. The BOOMING SOUNDS YET AGAIN. It is
metallic and staccato.
She stops in the corner beside an oil drum. Several drums
have toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs
her hair. She shines her light up to see that she stands at
the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way
through the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that
betrays a throughway to the outside.
The BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, this time coming from the pile of
oil drums. She steps closer, raising the shotgun, ready to
fire. A beat as she summons her courage, then reaches out to
push a drum with her foot, when A BLUR EXPLODES OUT AT HER.
She fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off
the steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks, a flurry of frenetic
flapping whizzing by her head as she looks up to see a large
albatross flying back up the hatchway shaft toward the top

She steps forward, following the smell, pushing aside the
toppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam
of her flashlight. She steps still closer, training her light
on the form to see that it is a human torso.  A large gash
runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by
scavenging birds.
She hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on
something. She starts, then shines the light on the deck in
front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with
wide, unseeing eyes.
It takes everything she has just to hold there. She shines
her light back to the headless torso.
She shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent
steam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried
blood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind
her, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her.
She spins around to see another body above her. Except this
one hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam
pipe. It has been impaled length-wise on the pipe from rectum
to mouth.

Dodge can be seen stepping from the deckhouse on the tug,

WITH DODGE
Dodge stumbles toward the bow, slipping on the wet deck. He
goes down, sliding into the water that washes over the
starboard rail.
He pulls himself up, using a cleat to push off. A deck locker
opens and the contents tumble around him. He struggles to
pull himself up to the base of the pilothouse. He climbs up
and edges his way toward the bow.
WITH THE OTHERS
Epps, Greer and Murphy look on as Dodge climbs up on the
skewed deck crane.
WITH DODGE
The tug is slowly lurching over as Dodge climbs the crane,
the top of which is sweeping away from the Chimera.
Below, the decks of the tug are swept with seawater as it
sinks lower and lower.
WITH THE OTHERS
They look on as Dodge climbs toward them, the sinking tug
pulling Dodge and the crane away from the ship.
Greer pulls back a line, tying it into the deck railing.
WITH DODGE
As Dodge makes his way up, he's forced to climb onto the
other side of the crane to keep from dangling over the water.
Above, Greer casts a line. It falls near, but out of reach
as the swell of the water starts to swing the crane to and
fro.  Dodge reaches out for the line again, his hand coming
close but not close enough.
The swell brings the crane toward the boat one last time and
Dodge reaches out, his fingers just coming to the line,
coaxing it into his grasp. He pulls it back and hangs on, as
the crane sways back with the foundering boat.
The crane falls away from Dodge, leaving him hanging in space
by the line from the bow of the Chimera.
WITH THE OTHERS
Murphy, Greer and Epps look on as Dodge hangs over the water
and the tug as its stern slowly sinks beneath the waves.
Dodge climbs the line toward the bow railing as the tug rolls
still further to port, the pilothouse dipping into the sea,
slipping lower and lower.
WITH DODGE
As he pulls himself upward, coming to the bottom of the rail
well on the Chimera where Murphy reaches out, just short of
Dodge's hand.
A SCREECHING SOUNDS and they turn to see the twin tow cables
coming taught against the hull in the anchor alley's of the
Chimera as the sinking tug pulls them tight.
With a CONCUSSIVE STRIKE, one cable is freed, snapping against
the Chimera's hull like a giant steel guitar string.  It
starts sliding along the hull as the tug drifts, pulling the
cable with it, toward Dodge as he dangles in mid air.
Dodge pulls himself up, reaching for Murphy, but still short.
A LOUD HISSING SOUNDS and Dodge turns to see misty air
escaping from ports and deck vents as the encroaching water
forces it out of the tug below decks.
The tow cable LOUDLY SCRAPES THE HULL in a shower of rust,
as Dodge struggles to pull himself up.
Murphy reaches out as Dodge extends as far as he can, their
hands barely reaching.
The tow cable is a mere few feet away and closing, ready to
scrape Dodge into the water or smear him across the hull
like a bug on a windshield, when Dodge pulls himself up with
everything he's got and Murphy grabs his hand.
Murphy pulls, lifting Dodge, as Greer grabs Dodge's other
hand and they pull him up, the tow cable sweeping by with a
SICKENING GRINDING SOUND OF HEAVY STEEL AGAINST STEEL.
Dodge turns to see the bow of the tug dip below the surface,
slowly going under until disappearing with a last exhalation
of misty air. The pilothouse is next to go, the last of it
slipping into the frothing water, then the crane, finally
disappearing altogether into the depths.

room in the front, is a bedroom.
Epps steps in. A dressing table sits against the far wall.
A large bed is unmade. Suitcases lie open on stands at the
foot of the bed, still half full as if they were in the
process of being unpacked.
From one, she pulls back a woman's gown, a blouse. The other
contains shirts, trousers, socks, and underwear.
Across the room a smaller suitcase can be seen lying open on
an Ottoman in the corner. Epps crosses to it. She finds a
few shirts, and a red print dress, some books. She takes one
of the books, opening it.
Inscribed on the inside of the cover is: ""This book belongs
to:"" and then written in by hand: ""Katie Nichols.""
A page is marked with a purple ribbon. She opens it to see a
children's poem ""The Rooster and the Crow"" and a drawing of
a rooster and a crow and a stanza of a poem: ""'Cock-a-doodle
doo,' said the rooster to the crow. 'Where are you now? I
know, but won't say so.'"" She puts it down. A tin penny
whistle sits on the table. She picks it up, examining it.
She opens a small picture book, thumbing through to see photos
of a family, a young mother and father at the beach, the
mother and a girl of about 9 years, the girl and an older
girl of about 16, the girl she saw at the swimming pool,
KATIE. Epps holds on this picture, when A MUSIC BOX SOUNDS.

he dives, taking her down.
He drags her back along the floor, spinning her around. He
raises a fist to ram into her face when WHAM!
Epps has shoved the butt of her flashlight into his crotch
and he comes up SCREAMING. He grabs her face, striking her
with his other hand.
She swings the flashlight again and cracks him across the
head. He swings yet again and connects, knocking her across
the floor.
She lies in a heap as Greer climbs to his feet, enraged and
bleeding.
He unbuckles his belt as he approaches, pulling it from his
waist to do God knows what.
Epps looks around to see him approaching. And we see that
she has unhinged her gill knife.
As his foot steps near, she lets go and drives the knife
with all her might into his boot, plunging the blade through
his foot and into the floor. He SCREAMS.
After a moment he stops, looks to her. He is a bloody,
wretched, enraged mess. He starts toward her as Murphy appears
in the doorway.
Just as Greer is upon her, Murphy blind sides Greer from
behind at full speed, knocking him down.
Greer and Murphy struggle as Epps climbs unsteadily to her
