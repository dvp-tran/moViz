Pooch's wife JOLENE, doing dishes in the sink again.
A RUSTLING. Jolene looks up this time. She obviously
heard it. She puts down the dishes and goes to the door.
Opens it and looks out to see...
Nothing. Not even by the swingset.
She sighs. About to head back inside when she spies
A GLINT OF LIGHT. By the oak tree in the front. She
steps outside. Walks down until she sees what it is.
Her breath hitches in her chest.
A frilly purple ribbon is tied around the old oak tree.
And now there are tears in Jolene's eyes. Because she
knows what it means.
Her husband is alive. And he will make it home.
Someday."|stage direction
