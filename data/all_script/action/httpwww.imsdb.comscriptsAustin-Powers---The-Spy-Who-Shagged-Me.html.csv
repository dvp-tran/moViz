87||Everyone is a little grossed out.|stage direction
88|DR. EVIL|"It's more of a nub, really. The spine
just goes on a little longer than it
should. Also, I've dabbled. I mean,
perform fellatio once and you're a
poet, twice and you're a homosexual.
I remember once I was being fisted
by Sebastian Cabot- but here's where
the story gets interesting. He was
lactose-intolerant. He could eat red
meat all night long, but one sip of
milk and it was gastric hell. And I
remember we were caught in fragrance
delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you
can imagine my humiliation at having
Hank hear me say, ""Mr. French, no
teeth."" One of my greatest
disappointments is that I never became
a song and dance man. I could have
been a quadruple threat, kind of
like a despotic Ken Barry. Dancer,
singer, actor, and I would possess
nuclear weapons, the latter being
the most threatening of the four. I
once sat on a bus and tried to will
myself a menstrual cycle. All I ended
up with was a sense of failure and a
mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth
and perhaps a grudging respect for
the weaker sex. I love toe cleavage.
For the most part I distrust dogs. I
slept in a horse once. It was quite
roomy. On second thought, it was the
Ritz. I named my left testicle 'piss'
and my right testicle 'vinegar'. I
wrote ""It's Raining Men"", or so the
Christmas babies told me. Oh yes, I
also made a Marzipan voodoo effigy
of The Fonze while I was in coma
after smoking some Peruvian prayer
hash, but who at the end of the day
can honestly say they haven't done
that?"|speech

528|GURU PITKA|"My name is the Guru Pitka. I am a
spiritual teacher and I have combined
many disparate disciplines into a
unified movement of human potentiality
and equipoise that I learned from my
guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste
man who died mysteriously of a disease
that strangely had all the hallmarks
of syphilis. He would say to me,
Sparky, love is all, life is breath."|speech
529|DISCIPLES|Ahhhhhh!|speech
530|GURU PITKA|"Now, perhaps you are wondering where
I got the nickname Sparky.  Well,
when we were young we used to play a
game called ""Stinkmop"". We would
urinate into a bucket, dip a mop
into it, and play tag. I did not
care for ""Stinkmop"" and a very wise
old man said to me 'oh lighten up,
Sparky', and I don't know, the name
kind of stuck."|speech
531|DISCIPLES|Ahhhhhhhh...|speech
532|GURU PITKA|"Now, the reason I am a spiritualist
instead of a therapist is that
'therapist' often becomes 'the rapist'
and that will not help us attain
potentiality. Now what is
potentiality? It is the ability to
achieve those goals that we wish to
achieve for ourselves. People often
say to me that they feel ""nowhere"",
and I am going to change that to
""Now here."""|speech

and your pump is weak, you better

Turn-of-the-century fat cat capitalists on stilts with teeth
coming out of their stomachs drop penis rockets that have
the word ""GREED"" written on the shaft, smashing the ""LOVE""
flowers into ""IRELO"" which sprouts into ""YELLOW"" which turns
into submarines, which becomes yellow penises of huge, goose-
stepping Dr. Evils, each of them peeing, creating a rain of
urine that falls on the Peter Max-ian valley of a hundred
Austin Powers citizens. They each open an umbrella that says
