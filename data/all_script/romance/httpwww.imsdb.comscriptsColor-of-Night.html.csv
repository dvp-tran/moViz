whole scene at Michelle's place, and they end at the beginning of
the scene at Bill Capa's office.
MICHELLE'S PLACE - INTERIOR DAY
Close-up on a silver lipstick stand made into a bad taste musical
box. We see Michelle's hand selecting a lipstick then we see
Michelle putting the lipstick on her lips, seated in front of the
mirror of her dressing table. She is dressed in a green frock, and
her face shows that she is quite disturbed."|stage direction
3|unknown|Her apartment's decoration is very heavy, with a lot of various|speech
4||useless objects and gold-plated furniture and many mirrors.|stage direction
5|unknown|She looks for a new dress in her wardrobe, and get mad at not|speech
6||"finding it. She then goes to a sofa covered with cushions, which
she throws all around the place, still madder at not finding her
dress. A cat, who was lying on the armrest of the sofa, runs away
hurriedly from the mad Michelle."|stage direction
7|MICHELLE|God !...... No !......|speech
8||"Michelle is back in front of the mirror of her dressing-table. She
takes the lipstick and put a lot of it on her lips, then on her
teeth, then all around her mouth. She makes faces to herself in
the mirror. She seems more and more disturbed."|stage direction
9|MICHELLE|She takes a chrome-plated revolver in her drawer, starts to put|speech
10||"it in her purse, then takes it out, spins the cylinder of the
revolver, and puts the revolver in her mouth, as if she wanted to
kill herself. But instead, she starts sucking the barrel, while
she strokes the revolver in a quite erotic way.
BILL CAPA' OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY
Large planes of ground glass. We hear, without understanding them,
some voices and laughs. Then a male voice becomes more
understandable..."|stage direction
11|BILL'S VOICE|"So who do you think is the enemy ?... No, no, give me a
specific answer..."|speech
12||"... then Michelle appears on the screen. She is dressed in a green
suit, she is heavily made up, et she still seems very disturbed."|stage direction
13|BILL'S VOICE|The office is very chic and evidently belongs to a very rich New-|speech
14||"York psycho-analyst. Beautiful and good taste furniture. Shelves
with leather-bound books."|stage direction
15|MICHELLE|"You are the goddamned enemy, Capa, you and this all tower
of psycho-babble. You know what I hope ? That God gets real
pissed off and He shrivels up your cock, so that it points
straight down to Hell, where you belongs !..."|speech
16||"During this reply, Bill Capa has appeared on the screen. He is
seated. He is wearing a long-sleeve shirt, a necktie, but no
jacket. He laughs at Michelle's last sentence."|stage direction
17|BILL|"OK... Michelle, so you will become His Avenging Angel, and
swoop down to finish me off."|speech
18||He stands up.|stage direction
19|MICHELLE|"Now, I finally get it : you're are like my ex-husband. You
think that everything got to be either black or white
because you got color-blind. But God is on my side now. He
knows I'm not like you"|speech
20|BILL|Well, we are pretty much the same, Michelle. We all do it.|speech
21|MICHELLE|We all do what ?|speech
22|BILL|"Tend to view our lives as we were looking through a
keyhole. I's a very limited view of the truth. So, we have
to fill in the blanks. We invent things."|speech
23|MICHELLE|I don't know what you mean.|speech
24|BILL|"You invent enemies to test your strength against. You
invent gods to protect you from these enemies."|speech
25||Cutting him.|stage direction
26|MICHELLE|"What a depressing view of life you have, that is such
horse-shit !"|speech
27|BILL|"Who is the enemy ? One minute you have friends, the next
moment they've slipped away. You leave here and I wonder
who is Michelle really hating this week. I try to remember
and I can't bring it to mind. Do you know why ?"|speech
28|MICHELLE|No, why don't you tell me|speech
29|BILL|Take a look in the mirror, Michelle|speech
30|MICHELLE|Which mirror ?... This mirror ?...|speech
31|BILL|Any mirror. Tell me what you see.|speech
32||We see Michelle as if we were watching her from behind the mirror.|stage direction
33|MICHELLE|"I see... I see your reflection over my shoulder... I see... there
is nothing much that I really like... I think I prefer the
view outside actually..."|speech
34||"During this last reply, Bill, standing up, is fidgeting with
something on his desk. At Michelle's last words, he turns toward
her, looking alarmed. But he doesn't have time to do prevent her
from breaking through the glass pane and jumping outside. He yells
«Michelle» twice.
A STREET IN NEW-YORK - EXTERIOR DAY
We see Michelle's body falling all the way down. Capa's office
must be around the 25th floor. The body crashes on the street. A
police horse, who was near the impact, rears up in fright. As if
the asphalt were translucent, we see Michelle's body from
underneath, with the blood flowing around it."|stage direction
35|SEVERAL VOICES|"All right, get back there... Stay back !... Get back in your
car... Stop it..."|speech
36||"BILL CAPA'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY
We see Bill with tears in his eyes. He walks to the broken window,
and look outside."|stage direction
37||Voice over.|stage direction
38|BILL|"My God, it was the reddest blood I ever saw, poured around
her green dress. And... Then the red disappeared..."|speech
39||"OPHTHALMOLOGIST'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY
Bill is seated with a huge ophthalmologic device on his head. He
finishes the preceding reply."|stage direction
40|BILL|"Christ, Ed. It was like a vibration of color broadcast from
Hell. And then the red started to fade away."|speech
41||"The ophthalmologist moves the device away. We see Bill's face, and
behind him, projected on the wall, an abstract drawing made of
colored spots close together. The red spots start to blink and
then they become grey.
LARRY'S PLACE - INTERIOR DAY
It is the apartment of an old New-York intellectual. A bit messy.
A old Earth globe on a stand. Objects and books everywhere, but
with an warm atmosphere. Larry wears an open shirt and a sweater.
Bill also is in open shirt, with a sleeveless sweater. At the
beginning of the scene, Bill is lying on a couch."|stage direction
42|LARRY|Poor Capa ! You're here for me to pity you.|speech
43||"Larry puts down the newspaper he was reading. It is the New York
Post. On the front page, a title in large prints : «Patient's
family sues Manhattan shrink»"|stage direction
44|BILL|"Hell, yes. It doesn't take Sigmund Freud to figure out I
don't care to see the color of my patients' blood."|speech
45|LARRY|I'm a little surprised that this happened to you.|speech
46|BILL|"Starts to stand up.
Sure. You always thought I was a cold-hearted son of a
bitch."|speech
47|LARRY|Not really, but there is a kind of arrogance here.|speech
48||Bill laughs.|stage direction
49|LARRY|"Do you really believe that you're responsible for her
illness. You were a small recent part of her life."|speech
50|BILL|"Yes, that's right, that's right. But it's all too fucking
glib for me, Larry. I cannot dispose of this woman that
easily."|speech
51|LARRY|"Well, you always were a romantic. Are you involved with
anyone else ?"|speech
52||"Larry starts to make tea in a corner of the room. Bill is seated
on an armchair during the following reply, and strokes the grey
cat who is lying on the table."|stage direction
53|BILL|"No. I am still a romantic. I just don't have anybody to be
romantic with. They want to fuck me or marry me... None of
them want to love me"|speech
54|LARRY|"Maybe you don't want to be loved. You had a happy marriage
once."|speech
55|BILL|"She loved me to death. Then she ran off and loved somebody
else to death."|speech
56|LARRY|"Of course, there is something else here. To deny red is to
deny emotion."|speech
57|BILL|Oh yeah !|speech
58|LARRY|As you know, that could be very dangerous.|speech
59||Bill stands up.|stage direction
60|BILL|"Yes, yes, I know. Very dangerous. I know and I have got
something broken. I know it's gonna take some time to get
fixed."|speech
61||He picks up his jacket on a chair and put it on.|stage direction
62|LARRY|"You're a pretty good therapist. How long does it take a man
like you to forgive himself."|speech
63|BILL|I see you when I get back from Los Angeles.|speech
64||During the two last replies, Bill has walked to the front door.|stage direction
65|LARRY|Don't run away because of one treatment failure.|speech
66|BILL|"I'm not running away, Larry, it's just a little trip to Los
Angeles. Besides, you can't really run away. It's all up
here, isn't it..."|speech
67||He shows his forehead and pretends he is shooting a bullet in it.|stage direction
68|BILL|Pow !... It's a package deal. The head goes with me.|speech
69||"ABOVE L.A. - EXTERIOR DAY
Shot of L.A. seen from the sky, then shot of an airplane landing.
On these two short shots, we hear :"|stage direction
70|STEWARDESS|"Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Los Angeles. Please remain
seated until the aircraft comes..."|speech
71||"The end of the sentence is not understandable, because it is mixed
with the sound of a radio set in a car."|stage direction
72|STEWARDESS|"VOICE IN THE RADIO
Just another Monday in paradise. There is a fender-bender
on 405, slowing thing down."|speech
73||"TAXI IN A TRAFFIC JAM - EXTERIOR DAY
The voice in the radio is covered by the voice of the taxi driver.

634|SONDRA|What are you saying ?|speech
635|CASEY|"I'm saying, Sondra, that you really, really have to hate a
person to stab him that many times. You're a shrink,
right ? You know what kind of power people hand over a
shrink. Or maybe sometimes, they hand even more than they
want to."|speech

committed suicide... Right in front of me."|speech

colleagues say... But I don't know..."|speech

the door. He looks cautiously around him before walking further.
He presses a switch to close the gate.
BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR NIGHT
Bill enters the house. It is very dark. He opens a glass door and

corridor.
BOB'S RESIDENCE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
Bill wades in the flooded corridor. He seems worried and we see
the knife blade shining. He enters the bathroom, the door of which

this, um, psycho-servitude. He is the sweetest kid you'll

rattlesnake whips a menacing forked tongue. The snake rattles,
