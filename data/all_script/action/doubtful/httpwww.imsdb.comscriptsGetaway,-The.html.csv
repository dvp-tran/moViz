A BIG DIESEL TRUCK AND TRAILER is coming in the opposite

DOC, AS THE TRUCK AND TRAILER SUDDENLY APPEAR THROUGH the

through a parking lot, taking with it a large cleaners sign,

Doc is faster and more agile than the thief, but the station

themselves conspicuous, thus risking police interference.

Carol comes up the stairwell and looks back for Doc. The
SOUND of Swain's pistol and Doc's answering .45. Carol senses
a movement; she turns and sees Cully's gun leveled at her. As
Carol screams:
Doc dives onto the landing facing the corridor... his plane

CULLY IS HIT IN THE CHEST BY BUCKSHOT. The killing wounds
fling him upward as he fires his own gun... his aim destroyed

their mark.
DOC FIRES THREE TIMES MORE AT THE ELEVATOR CABLE
THE CORRIDOR WALL NEAR THE ELEVATOR IS SMASHED BY ONE OF the
