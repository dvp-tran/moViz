1 EXT. U.S. EMBASSY (TEHRAN) - MORNING 1
Effigies of Jimmy Carter and the deposed Shah -- crowds
chanting Magbar Carter! Magbar Ahmrika!ù Fists in the
air.
SUPERIMPOSE: TEHRAN - NOVEMBER 4, 1979
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN -- about 2/3 men and 1/3 women, some
with flak jackets; about half the young women wear full
chador. Many wear plastic bibs with photographs of
Ayatollah Khomeini.
PASTED TO ROOSEVELT GATE: photographs of STUDENTS who
were killed under the deposed Shah of Iran's regime.
Signs in English: U.S.A. RETURN THE SHAHù -- JUSTICE
FOR MURDER.ù A few IRANIAN POLICE attend -- more as
bystanders than peacekeepers.
A MAN frantically stabs an EFFIGY of the SHAH.
An IRANIAN STUDENT films the scene with a Super 8 camera.
2 EXT. EMBASSY GROUNDS - MORNING 2
From INSIDE THE EMBASSY GATES we can hear the noise of
the protest. There are three primary buildings on
campus: the CHANCERY, the embassy's main building, THE
AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, and the CONSULATE.
We can see that the compound is securitized: sand-filled
traps and steel bars on the windows of the consulate.
3 INT. U.S. EMBASSY - CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 3
Now, we see the POV THROUGH those steel bars.
Standing on a chair looking at the protest outside the

WOMEN raise a banner. It's a signal.
