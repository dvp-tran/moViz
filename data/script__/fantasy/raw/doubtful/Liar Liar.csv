26||"FLETCHER REID, early 30's, stands before the JUDGE. His
manner is utterly genuine and convincing.
FLETCHER
A dark street. . . a stormy
night... two desperate men
struggle... one man is taken
to the hospital, the other to
ja il. The prosecutor wants
you to believe this is an
open-and-shut case of a poor
man, brutally victimized.
He nods at the victim - - a fragile OLD MAN in his 70's.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Well, for once I agree with
t he prosecutor. This is an
open-and shut case -- but the
true victim is my client.
Fletcher's CLIENT is a 250 pound brute in a suit.
FLETCHER (CONT'D)
Put yourself in his shoes for
a moment--walking home from
church, alone, in a
frightening part of the
suburbs.
As he describes his client's movements, Fletcher ACTS THEM
OUT:

you do what any respectable
citizen would -- you defend

mistake... the man was merely
walking away from an ATM
machine, the apparent flash of
metal caused by his bank card."|speech

35|MS. BERRY|"As you stand over his
crumpled, though potentially
still-dangerous form, your

want to help. First, you
gather up the many bills he
dropped, to stop them from
bl owi ng away. Second, in an
effort to get the name and
number of someone to notify,
you take his wallet. Finally,
you leap into the man's Lexus
to head for assistance, when
suddenly a police car speeds
up. You breathe a sigh of
relief: ""Someone to look -after
the injured man! Oh joy!""
But do the police applaud your
initiative? Do they hail your
heroism? No-- they arrest you
and throw you in the slammer!"|speech
