In the darkness, we hear the solitary sound of a HEARTBEAT,
resounding like a drum."|stage direction
2|unknown|"NARRATOR (V.O)
In between the years when the
oceans drank Atlantis and the rise
of the Sons of Aryas, there was an
age undreamed of, when shining
kingdoms lay spread across the
world like blue mantles under the
stars. Hither came Conan, the
Cimmerian: a thief, a slayer, a
king born of battle."|speech
3||"Muffled sounds, as if underwater, echo: CLANGING swords, the
guttural CRIES of combat."|stage direction

5||"Eyes closed, floating at peace within red glow of the womb.
Suddenly, a flash of steel, as a sword pierces the womb, its
tip not an inch from the baby's head.
As the sword is ripped out, light streams in from outside, we
travel with it, into the DIN of BATTLE."|stage direction

7||"A blonde-haired, armored AESIR RAIDER withdraws the bloody
sword from the stomach of ISLENE, a wild-maned Cimmerian
beauty, many months pregnant, now clutching her bloody
stomach.
Across a muddy battlefield, the air a maelstrom of falling
snowflakes and embers from trees aflame, the powerfully built
CORIN rallies his fellow CIMMERIANS, until he spots Islene."|stage direction
8|CORIN|Islene!!!|speech
9||"Wielding a broadsword, runes etched into its surface, Corin
cuts a bloody path through his enemies, his eyes never
leaving Islene.
The Aesir standing over Islene LAUGHS as she claws at the
earth behind her, trying to pull herself away."|stage direction
10|AESIR|"Now, now little whore. Did I get
you or your little one?
2."|speech
11||"Islene's hand reaches back once again -- and it finds a
fallen warrior's SWORD. In one fluid motion she swings the
sword around her body and drives it into the gap in the
Aesir's armor -- at his groin."|stage direction
12|ISLENE|I'd ask you the same.|speech
13||"The Aesir HOWLS in agony, raising his sword to deliver the
killing blow -- when another sword pierces his chest. The
Aesir falls, revealing Corin standing behind him.
Corin throws aside his horned helmet, and falls to his knees
beside Islene, checking her wound. When he pulls his hands
back they are coated in blood.
Their eyes meet. Torment. Loss. They both know. She pulls a
knife from the folds of her pelts, puts it in his hand."|stage direction
14|ISLENE (CONT'D)|Take your child.|speech
15|CORIN|I cannot.|speech
16||"Islene looks to her naked belly. The baby inside presses
against its womb, a visible impression on her flesh."|stage direction
17|ISLENE|"There is no time, husband. I would
see my child's face."|speech
18||"Islene's eyes flutter as she struggles. Corin lowers the
knife. Islene's eyes lock with Corin's as he puts the knife
to use. Never once does she scream.
A moment later, Corin lifts the crying, blood-covered BOY up
through the falling snowflakes to Islene's lap."|stage direction
19|ISLENE (CONT'D)|"A boy. He will be strong. A warrior
with no equal."|speech
20|CORIN|Do not speak, love.|speech
21|ISLENE|"You have never been able to still
my tongue, and you will not this
day. He will be wild, Corin. You
must temper him."|speech

27||EXT. CIMMERIAN VILLAGE - DAY|location
28||"A small Cimmerian village lies in a heavily forested valley,
a redoubt from the icy mountains surrounding it.
Round wooden huts surround a stone-lined pit, where young
CIMMERIAN BOYS, ages 12-15 stand. Pollen drifts through the
air, giving it an ethereal haze.
At the center of the pit URAN, an elder Cimmerian warrior
speaks."|stage direction
29|URAN|"A Cimmerian warrior is like any
other man. A Cimmerian warrior
feels hunger. He feels cold. Like
other men he may lie and cheat.
(stares the boys down)
But when a Cimmerian warrior
hungers, he hungers only for the
blood of his enemy. When he feels
cold, it is the cold steel of his
sword. When he lies, he lies in
wait for his enemy. And when he
cheats, he cheats death itself!"|speech
30||"Uran stops at the end of the line, where a boy stands a good
two heads smaller than the rest. He is no more than eight,
but his face is as stoic, driven."|stage direction
31|URAN (CONT'D)|"Conan! You are too young to be
here. Withdraw."|speech
32||"CONAN, determined, doesn't move an inch. The LARGEST TEEN
menacingly steps up to the smaller boy."|stage direction
33|LARGEST TEEN|"He said leave, motherless whelp.
4."|speech
34||"The hulking teen goes to shove Conan, but Conan pulls his arm
towards him, lashing out with his other hand, punching the
teen in the throat.
The large boy goes down hard, hands and knees, gasping for
air.
A smattering of LAUGHS erupt from the boys, quickly silenced
by Uran's stare. Uran hands out RIVER STONES to each boy,
ending with Conan. The boys know what to do: they put the
large stones in their mouths."|stage direction
35|URAN|"In the black crag in the high pass
stands a wooden training sword. The
one who claims it, with stone still
in his mouth, will have earned the
right to train with the warriors."|speech
36||The boys look at each other, sizing up the competition.|stage direction
37|URAN (CONT'D)|Well? What are you waiting for?!|speech
38||"And off they run. They knock each other down, punching the
other's stomachs, each trying to force the other to expel
their stones. One or two succeed.
Most of the remaining boys run for the trail that winds high
into the mountains. But a few head right for the sheer cliff
face.
Conan follows the ones headed to the cliff."|stage direction
39||CLIFF FACE|location
40||"And when the Cimmerian boys climb, it is a sight to behold.
They find cracks we can barely see and scale the smooth rock
face as though it were a ladder.
The hulking teen reaches for the same handhold as Conan,
trying to knock him off. Conan swings with one hand and finds
another path. In moments he is ahead."|stage direction
41||EXT. FOREST - DAY|location
42||"Conan is in the lead as he crests the cliff top, the bigger
boys right behind him.
They race through the forest, heading uphill --
When Conan spots movement ahead. He pauses --"|stage direction
43|URAN (CONT'D)|5.|speech
44||"And the largest teen elbows past Conan, into the lead. The
boy runs two paces more and suddenly flies off his feet, an
AXE lodged squarely in his forehead.
All the boys stop. Out of the dense forest come
FOUR PICTISH SAVAGES
Covered with fearsome war paint and armed with dual hand
axes, the rotting heads of their enemies are slung at their
waist.
The boys spit out the rocks in their mouths and YELL. They
turn and run in the opposite direction.
Only Conan doesn't move, even as another boy pulls at him."|stage direction
45|CIMMERIAN BOY|Conan! Run!|speech
46||"But Conan simply pulls the axe from his large boy's skull. He
turns to face the Picts, his eyes burning.
The Picts LAUGH and CHARGE CONAN."|stage direction
47||LATER|location
48||"Corin arrives with Uran and other armed CIMMERIAN WARRIORS.
They get a brief glimpse of a single PICT, escaping in the
other direction. One of the Cimmerians takes off in pursuit.
Corin desperately searches for his son."|stage direction
49|CORIN|Conan? Conan?!|speech
50||"Conan steps forward from out of a thicket, his body covered
in Pict blood. Three PICTS lie massacred, the bodies hacked
to pieces."|stage direction
51|CORIN (CONT'D)|What have you done, boy?|speech
52||"Conan walks past the other stunned Cimmerians, up to his
father. Conan SPITS OUT the bloody stone from his mouth."|stage direction
53|CONAN|"They killed one. I killed three. I
am a warrior now."|speech
54||"Uran and the other Cimmerian men exchange worried glances.
Looking at the carved up bodies of the Picts, they are
aghast. Conan looks confused. Why aren't they happy?"|stage direction
55|CONAN|6.|speech
56|CORIN|"A warrior? What you have done a
jackal would do. Never a warrior."|speech

myself."|speech

inside.

wet river rocks.

on the jagged rocks."|stage direction

63||"Flames reflect in the blue eyes of Conan as he works the
bellows of the forge. Sparks buzz like angry fireflies as he
stokes the blaze.
Corin sharpens a sword, perfecting it. Conan cannot take his
eyes off it, stepping away from the bellows."|stage direction

65||Conan slams the bellows closed, anger rising.|stage direction
66|CONAN|"""Stoke your fire, chop your wood.""
I have slept where wolves dare not.
I have balanced a thousand river

69|CORIN|"Think you're ready? Then tell me:
what is a sword's purpose?"|speech
70|CONAN|To slay ones enemies.|speech

purpose is why you use it."|speech
72||He tosses Conan two lumps of ore.|stage direction
73|CORIN (CONT'D)|"Tell me, which makes the best
sword?"|speech
74||"Conan takes the two lumps, testing them. He hands his father
back one."|stage direction

make a sword of it, and tomorrow
you will show me what brute
strength yields."|speech
76||EXT. FIELD - DUSK|location
77||"With a setting sun silhouetting the two, Conan attacks Corin.
Conan attacks with fury. Corin defends with grace. Until the
boy overextends and Corin slashes down a counterattack that
SHATTERS CONAN'S SWORD.
Corin simply turns and walks away, leaving Conan to puzzle
what happened.
Corin lowers his sword and walks away, leaving Conan to
puzzle what happened."|stage direction

places both ores in the furnace where they begin to melt."|stage direction

8."|speech
81|CORIN|Because it had no life.|speech
82||"Sparks fly as Corin pounds on the glowing edge of the sword
with hammer. Corin nods at Conan, who sprinkles the glowing
blade with ash."|stage direction
83|CUT TO:|"CORIN (O.S.) (CONT'D)
The strongest blade isn't made of
the hardest steel, boy. The hardest
ore is what a man will die for. It
is strong and unyielding. It
neither cowers nor concedes. But
without the softer ore, it can be
shattered like glass."|speech
84||"Steam rises as Corin lowers the blade into a freezing slack
tub, only to place it right back into the flames."|stage direction
85|CORIN (CONT'D)|"The softer ore is what a man lives
for. It is flexible and lasting. It
survives, even against the greatest
of foes. But too much of the soft
ore, the blade will not cut deep
enough when it must."|speech
86||"Corin fashions the blade's hilt, engraving the guard and
pommel. It is a work of art."|stage direction
87|CORIN (CONT'D)|"A sword must be tempered, the two
ores united through fire and ice.
Through its suffering the sword
comes to hold both life and death."|speech
88||Corin hands Conan the sword.|stage direction
89|CORIN (CONT'D)|"Now tell me, what is this sword's
purpose?"|speech
90||"Conan furrows his brow, trying to puzzle the answer. He
can't. Corin's disappointment shows. He takes the sword from
Conan's hands."|stage direction

everything within reach of him, expending his rage.
Behind him something moves in the forest. We catch just a

earlier scene.
Conan's instincts cause him to spin around -- but then
there's nothing there."|stage direction

96||"Built into the side of a huge tree, fifty feet up, this
wooden structure houses two CIMMERIAN SENTRIES. A BIRD CRIES

THWICK! He suddenly stands up straight, unmoving. The one
still sitting in the structure notices."|stage direction
97|CIMMERIAN SENTRY|See something?|speech
98||"The standing sentry falls backwards, revealing an ARROW
piercing his right eye. Shocked, the remaining sentry reaches
for the WARNING HORN mounted on the wall.
But as he reaches for it, his shadow becomes three
dimensional, MORPHING into
A SHADOW SCOUT
A thin, feral humanoid, bodies covered in tattoos, from the
deepest jungles of Zingara. The scout lashes out with his
black sword and cuts straight across the sentry's throat.
This Shadow Scout's name is REMO."|stage direction

102||"And the forest comes alive. The forces are an odd
combination; massive KUSHITE TRIBESMEN, dark-skinned savages
from the savannahs of Kush, and a LEGION OF AQUILONIAN
MERCENARIES, heavily armored knights drawn from the cities of
Aquilonia.
Their leaders, respectively, are the six foot-five Kushite
chief UKAFA, gold-toothed, his body painted for battle, and
the handsome, silver-armored Aquilonian LUCIUS."|stage direction

towers."|speech

lowly tribe of barbarians.
KHALAR SINGH (O.S.)
This lowly tribe of barbarians have
buried every warrior ever to set
foot on this land, Lucius."|speech

fog-shrouded trees.
He bears a nomadic visage, with tanned skin and almond-shaped
eyes. While his voice is calm, his eyes burn with malice."|stage direction

never faced my legion."|speech

11."|speech
113||"Corin looks to the ridge above the village, noticing a thick
fog creeping in. The fog curls and eddies, something is out
there.
Suddenly, Lucius and his legion of silver-armored warriors
burst out of the fog, attacking with speed and strength.
But the Cimmerians are hardly caught flat footed. In seconds
they are armed, and they counter the charge with a furious
charge of their own.
SLAM! Sword and bone collide as the two enemy fronts smash
into each other. And the battle devolves into one-on-ones --
Where the barbarians have the upper hand. Uran and Corin lead
the main push of battle-frenzied barbarians as they swing
their huge broadswords, extending their reach advantage over
the Aquilonian's shorter weapons.
And quickly, the Aquilonian's numbers are cut in half. Corin
squares off against Lucius himself. Lucius is sweating.
Worried. It wasn't supposed to be this hard."|stage direction

seconds, the Cimmerians give chase in wild pursuit."|stage direction

124||"They let the arrows fly, streaking balls of flame heading
right for the Cimmerians. But they do not hit them. They hit
the tree trunks beside them.
And for a moment, the Cimmerians look relieved, until they
notice small bags of a black substance tied to the arrows.
The flames lick at the substance --
KABOOM! The forest erupts into flames as the Cimmerian
warriors are burned alive."|stage direction

Ukafa and his Kushite warriors erupt out of the forest. Armed
with fearsome barbed spears they charge the remaining
Cimmerians, savage against savage.
But the Kushites are not alone. From behind the Cimmerians
comes, AKHUN, a massive four hundred pounds of flesh, wearing
loops of chains like armor, leads his turbaned TURANIAN
HORSEMEN into the village.
The Cimmerian WOMEN arm themselves, but the Horsemen attack
with NINE TAILED WHIPS pulling their swords from their hands

THROW HIM IN THE FIERY FORGE. Lucius SCREAMS in agony, rising
up to reveal half of his formerly handsome face burned to a

I take no pleasure in this day,

choose the story for yourself. I am
Khalar Singh. My army is handpicked
from the best Hyboria. My second,
Ukafa, and his Kushite horde. Remo

others. They all had a day like
this one. They all chose a way
forward."|speech

crown. That is the legacy I seek.
Will you join me?"|speech

tongue, unmoved."|stage direction

Very well. Then death will be your
story. Your men will die. And your
women too, when I am done with

ever were. You will be wiped from

Khalar picks up THE SWORD Corin and Conan had forged

it to his son. He keeps a hand on it as it is too heavy for

weakness. For the true power of
Acheron laid not with its King, but
the Queen. Every twenty years, a
new queen from the royal line would
be coronated with a crown of iron.
Spikes would pierce her, slowly
drain her precious blood, and
