5||"Blue sky, a few puffs of cloud, pierced by slanting rays of
sunlight. Late afternoon on a perfect day.
SUPER TITLE: ""HOUSTON, TEXAS. JULY 4, 2020.""
As we hear, after a few more beats, an ASTRONAUT'S VOICE."|stage direction
6|PHIL|"T minus ten, nine, eight, start
ignition sequence, five, four, three,
two, one, ignition... Liftoff!"|speech
7||"A tiny red streak zips into the sky, then bursts with a faint,
ludicrous POP. A bottle rocket. We hear CHILDREN'S LAUGHTER,
excited SHOUTS."|stage direction
8||EXT. LAWN PARTY. LUKE GRAHAM'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON|location
9||"DESCENDING, we see PHIL OHLMYER, late 20's, kneeling, with a
gaggle of eager CHILDREN around him. Phil, an astronaut, has
got an impressive array of fireworks lined up, and is using
an empty longneck as his launching tube."|stage direction
10||(all at once)|location
11|CHILDREN|"My turn! My turn! No, I was next!
No, me! Uncle Phil, Uncle Phil, can
I do one? I want to do one!"|speech
12|PHIL|"Guys, guys, please! This is risky
stuff here. And I'm a highly trained
professional."|speech
13||"Derisive GROANS from the kids, more SHOUTS. Phil grins.
There's little danger NASA will ever use him on a recruiting
poster: he's messy, very hyper. Phil waves his hands for
silence."|stage direction
14|PHIL|"Okay, okay! Uncle Phil will launch
another booster..."|speech
15||"Another astronaut, RENEE COTE, a tall, very fit French woman,
is walking by with a fresh six-pack. She tosses a beer and
Phil catches it."|stage direction
16|PHIL|"...just as soon as he completes his
fuel intake."|speech
17||"ANGLE FOLLOWS COTE
Who grins, walking away from Phil and the kids, as we begin
to get a better sense of the scope of this party. We are in
the big back yard of a middle-class home in a Houston suburb.
DOZENS OF PEOPLE - astronauts, NASA personnel, and their
families -- are gathered around picnic tables or spread-out
blankets. Lots of red, white and blue bunting, lots of
balloons. We hear snatches of MUSIC, mostly country-flavored,
from dueling boomboxes. Futuristic Frisbees are being tossed
about. A banner, strung between trees, reads ""BON VOYAGE,
MARS ONE!!!"""|stage direction
18|WILLIS|"It'll take us six months just to get
to Mars. Another year on the surface,
then six months back. That's two
years..."|speech
19||"Passing the banner, Cote lobs a beer to another astronaut,
NICHOLAS WILLIS, who snags it neatly. He's got his other arm
around the waist of a PRETTY GIRL. As Cote moves OUT OF FRAME,
ANGLE LINGERS on these two. Willis, a very young astronaut,
early 20s, is recruiting poster material, and knows it all
too well."|stage direction
20|WILLIS|"I guess what I'm trying to say is,
since this is my last night on Earth,
it's gonna be a very precious memory
to me. Y'know?"|speech
21|PRETTY GIRL|Nice try, Nick.|speech
22||"As the Pretty Girl slips out of his grasp, laughing, and
walks away, Willis shrugs philosophically. He pops open his
beer, swigs it.
ANGLE FOLLOWS THE PRETTY GIRL As she swerves around an open-
pit barbecue, where other ASTRONAUTS are gathered. Cote has
paused here, too, distributing the last of her beers. SERGEI
KIROV, a Russian cosmonaut, is watching some kids nearby as
they play a game of wiffle ball. He turns, grinning beerily
at the chef."|stage direction
23|KIROV|"Hey, Woody, our Mars One crew won't
be heading back to Earth till ten
days after you guys land at our base
camp with Mars Two. That's a pretty
good long rendezvous."|speech
24||"WOODY BLAKE, late 30s, is a big, rangy guy in a cowboy hat
over a Hawaiian shirt and a ""KISS THE CHEF"" apron. An entire
pig is turning on a spit over the flames, and Woody is basting
this as he smiles at Malik."|stage direction
25|WOODY|What are you suggesting, Sergei?|speech
26|KIROV|"Maybe you should bring a baseball
bat. Yes? American baseball? Our two
crews could have ourselves a little
Solar System Series."|speech
27|WOODY|"Please. Half you guys are foreigners.
We'd crush you."|speech
28|KIROV|"No, no, we have equal crews. Three
men, one woman. Same handicap."|speech
29||He grins teasingly at Cote, who makes a face at him.|stage direction
30|WOODY|"Easy now, you're talking about my
wife."|speech
31||(seeing her approach)|location
32|WOODY|"And Terri just happens to be one
helluva shortstop."|speech
33||"DR. TERRI FISHER, early 30s, passes by with a platter of
corn-on-the-cob. Short, sturdy body, a face made attractive
by its alert, questing intelligence. She pauses to kiss
Woody's cheek; there's a wonderful, sexy spark between them.
Then she glances at Kirov, all business now."|stage direction
34|TERRI|"Fast pitch, no steals, batter calls
his own strikes. Thousand bucks make
it interesting?"|speech
35||"He's a bit rattled by her cockiness, and looks at Cote, who
smiles, nods her cool agreement."|stage direction
36|COTE|Eh bien. Winner take all.|speech
37|TERRI|Good.|speech
38||"(smiles sweetly at
Kirov)"|location
39|TERRI|Bring some balls.|speech
40||"The other men ooooh at this, busting on Kirov and Cote, as
Terri moves on. Woody, watching her go, has a thousand-watt
grin."|stage direction
41|WOODY|"You wanna know the sad part?
Technically I outrank her. But if we
want any peace at all on Mars Two,
I'm gonna be saying a lot of ""Yes,
dears."""|speech
42||"The others laugh.
ANGLE FOLLOWS TERRI as she dodges a PACK OF KIDS -- they run
by her, shrieking happily - before she finally reaches a
picnic table, where ASTRONAUTS' WIVES are opening containers
of baked beans, coleslaw, and potato salad."|stage direction
43|1ST WIFE|"...just not sure how I feel about
NASA allowing couples to go on this
type of mission together."|speech
44||"One of the other women raises a warning eyebrow, and the 1st
Wife turns, sees Terri setting down her platter."|stage direction
45||(embarrassed)|location
46|1ST WIFE|"Nothing personal, Terri. It's just
that, well, it's kind of a funny
feeling for those of us staying
behind."|speech
47||(carefully neutral)|location
48|TERRI|"All the research shows that marriage
will provide stability on these long
duration trips."|speech
49|2ND WIFE|"Then they haven't studied some of
the couples I've known."|speech
50||"Laughter at this. Terri smiles politely -- she doesn't really
have much in common with these women -- before moving on.
ANGLE LINGERS on the wives, who watch her go with a slight
tinge of jealousy. One of them is looking around."|stage direction
51|3RD WIFE|Anybody seen Jim McConnell?|speech
52|4TH WIFE|I don't think he's coming.|speech
53|1ST WIFE|God, that poor man. How's he doing?|speech
54|2ND WIFE|"Totally losing it, from what I hear.
Can't sleep, can't eat. Visits her
grave almost every day."|speech
55||(lowers her voice)|location
56|2ND WIFE|They say he could lose mission status.|speech
57|3RD WIFE|"Oh, that's so sad. That is just so
tragic. You go to a routine physical
one day, and wham."|speech
58|4TH WIFE|"After all those years of training,
too. It was their whole dream."|speech
59|1ST WIFE|"Must be a pretty funny feeling for
Luke Graham. Y'know? Now he's gonna
be in the history books. First man
on Mars..."|speech
60||"She shakes her head, awed by the thought. The others nod in
agreement, following her glance...
In the distance, a lone MALE FIGURE stands by the garage,
his back to them, facing the parked cars, vans, and SUVs
which stretch down the driveway and along the street. Another
figure, a WOMAN, can be seen approaching him.
CLOSER ANGLE FOLLOWS the moving woman -- DEBRA GRAHAM, early
30s, very attractive -- until she reaches her husband. LUKE
GRAHAM, mid 30s, has the lean, fit body of an astronaut, the
restless intellect of a scientist. He's unaware of her
approach until she touches his shoulder. He looks at her
with an apologetic smile."|stage direction
61|DEBRA|He's not coming, Luke.|speech
62|LUKE|"Jim deserves this, too. All his
friends are here. And it's my last
night."|speech
63||(gently)|location
64|DEBRA|Your last night with us, too.|speech
65||"He looks at her, moved. She summons a smile. He slides his
arms around her waist, kisses her forehead."|stage direction
66|LUKE|I love you, Deb.|speech
67|DEBRA|"I love you too, baby. But maybe you
should spend some time with Bobby."|speech
68|LUKE|Yeah. I will. Where is he?|speech
69|DEBRA|Up in his fort.|speech
70||"He kisses her again, then goes. Debra's eyes follow him,
with a mixture of pride and sadness.
ANGLE FOLLOWS Luke away from the garage, into"|stage direction
71||EXT. THE BACK YARD. LATE AFTERNOON|location
72||"Luke moves through the crowd. Phil and the kids are still
shooting off rockets. Red streaks arc high overhead.
In the back corner of the yard, where it's quieter, he passes
Willis, who's sitting on a blanket, murmuring soulfully to
PRETTY GIRL #2."|stage direction
73|WILLIS|"Deep space is so lonesome. So cold.
But I guess I'll have my memories to
keep me warm..."|speech
74||"Luke shakes his head. Willis is incorrigible. Finally he
reaches a tall redwood playset. He looks up the ladder.
A SMALL BOY sits on the platform of the tower, arms around
his knees, staring up at the stars. A telescope rests nearby
on a tripod. He looks lonely.
Luke climbs up, sits down on the wooden deck next to him.
BOBBY, 7, glances over at his dad, his idol, then back at
the sky."|stage direction
75|BOBBY|"Who's gonna read to me now, at
bedtime?"|speech
76||Luke is surprised by the question. A pause.|stage direction
77|LUKE|Mommy will.|speech
78|BOBBY|"I like when you do it. Now we're
never gonna finish our book."|speech
79||"His voice is unexpectedly fierce. He's fighting back tears.
Luke is moved. Another brief silence."|stage direction
80|LUKE|"Well, I'll tell you what. I've been
thinking about that. And what I
thought was -- how 'bout if I bring
along my own copy?"|speech
81||(Bobby looks at him)|location
82|LUKE|"Then every night, wherever I am,
I'll read a little bit more of it.
And I'll know that you and Mommy,
wherever you are, you're reading it
too. That way, it'll feel like we're
still reading it together. 'Cause I
don't know about you, but I'm pretty
anxious to find out how 'ol Ben Gunn
got marooned on that island. What
d'you say?"|speech
83||"Bobby manages a smile. He nods, feeling a little better.
Luke is proud of his son's courage."|stage direction
84|LUKE|Good deal. Can I have a hug?|speech
85||"Bobby's arms go around his father's neck. He hugs Luke
fiercely, and Luke hugs him back. His eyes, over the thin
young shoulders, are brimming with love and impending absence.
Then, from the distance, the sound of an APPROACHING CAR.
They both turn.
An open Jeep is coming down the street. Its DRIVER is alone.
Luke's expression changes. Recognition, then happiness."|stage direction
86||EXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATE AFTERNOON|location
87||"The Jeep stops, its electric engine WHIRRING down. The Driver
climbs out wearily, reaching into the back seat, and comes
out with a champagne bottle, hastily decorated with ribbon.
The PARTY SOUNDS are drifting this way, and he hesitates a
moment, seeming to gather himself. He starts gamely towards
the party, then pauses again.
Debra Graham stands nearby on the front lawn, waiting. She
smiles tentatively.
JIM MCCONNELL, early 40s, manages a smile in return. He has
dark circles under his eyes, and his clothes look slept in.
Yet we sense, even through his sadness, a kind of quiet
competence in this man, an unforced authority; he's a natural
leader.
Debra hurries forward, into his arms, and he hugs her. They
separate, looking at each other. Her eyes are shining."|stage direction
88|DEBRA|We were afraid you wouldn't come.|speech
89|MCCONNELL|"I caught a whiff of your barbecue.
After that I was helpless."|speech
90|DEBRA|All the way out in Galveston?|speech
91|MCCONNELL|Something like that.|speech
92||(she smiles)|location
93|MCCONNELL|"It's his night, Deb. I didn't want
to spoil it."|speech
94|DEBRA|"Spoil it? He's been going crazy
looking for you."|speech
95||"Over her shoulder he sees Luke approaching, his arm around
Bobby. The two men look at each other, the bond between them
so strong it needs no words. Finally Luke smiles."|stage direction
96|LUKE|"C'mon. A whole lot of folks here are
gonna be mighty glad to see you."|speech
97||"McConnell comes towards him, accompanied by Debra, and
together the four of them move OUT OF FRAME, heading towards
the party. ANGLE HOLDS on the parking area, as we..."|stage direction

99||EXT. SAME VIEW. NIGHT (HOURS LATER)|location
100||"All the parked cars and vans are gone now, except for two:
McConnell's Jeep and Woody's classic 'Vette. Willis, one of
the last to go, is just departing on his motorcycle. Perched
behind him, arms around his waist, is PRETTY GIRL #3. They
zoom away, through the darkened neighborhood."|stage direction
101||EXT. BACK YARD. NIGHT|location
102||"The yard is nearly deserted. The ""Bon Voyage"" banner has
torn loose at one end and flutters limply. Here and there a
napkin blows across the ground.
In the distance, THREE FIGURES sit on the ground, by the
waning fire of the barbecue pit, sipping beers.
CLOSER ON THIS TRIO
As Woody shoves another piece of wood into the flames. For a
moment he, McConnell, and Luke are silent, staring at the
sparks as they rise towards the stars -- red and gold dots
mingling with the silver ones."|stage direction
103||(abruptly)|location
104|WOODY|I wish we were all going. Together.|speech
105||"The intensity in his voice surprises the others, and even
Woody himself. Luke glances at McConnell. An awkward beat."|stage direction
106|LUKE|"Then you've got a short memory. Think
back to how we were by the second
week of lunar training."|speech
107|WOODY|"Oh, you're not gonna bring that up
again --"|speech
108||(laughing)|location
109|LUKE|"I'm trying to remember, let's see,
which one of us scored the lowest
ranking up there?"|speech
110|WOODY|You just can't let that go --|speech
111|LUKE|"Oh, man, three commanders, on the
same ship? If they sent us off to
Mars together, there wouldn't be
enough fuel to lift all those egos."|speech
112||(laughs)|location
113|WOODY|"Bullshit, we would've made a great
crew."|speech
114|MCCONNELL|"That was never gonna happen. I was
always teamed with Maggie, and we
were mostly chalkboard jockies. You
know? Systems. Payloads..."|speech
115|LUKE|"Listen to him. Mr. Cover-of-Time
Magazine!"|speech
116|WOODY|"Yeah, who landed the crippled Block
II Shuttle?"|speech
117|LUKE|"Yeah, and who scored highest on the
lunar rankings?"|speech
118|WOODY|Let it go, Luke.|speech
119||(smiles)|location
120|MCCONNELL|"Sure, I made a little noise. But
putting the first footprints on Mars?
Nah. That's for guys who..."|speech
121||(looks at Luke)|location
122|MCCONNELL|"...wrote their Ph.D. thesis on how
to colonize the place. And guys who..."|speech
123||(looks at Woody)|location
124|MCCONNELL|"...read too much science fiction as
a kid and still wear little Flash
Gordon rocketships around their necks."|speech
125||"He grabs playfully at Woody's neck. Woody smacks his hand
away, laughing."|stage direction
126|WOODY|"You read the same damn science fiction
books that I did! You're just not
man enough to wear jewelry!"|speech
127||"He pulls from his shirt a little Flash Gordon rocketship
emblem hanging on a chain, and waggles this tauntingly at
McConnell, as Luke and McConnell laugh."|stage direction
128|WOODY|"You want Flash. You know you want
him. Well you'll have to come through
me!"|speech
129||"Luke grabs Woody's arm to give McConnell a better shot at
the emblem, but Woody cuffs his hands away, laughing.
McConnell, watching their horseplay, shakes his head."|stage direction
130|MCCONNELL|"God, she would've loved to see you
two clowns. Just one more time."|speech
131||"He tries to smile, but his face reddens. Then all at once
his chest is heaving as he struggles to control his emotions.
Woody sees this, reaches out a reassuring hand, but McConnell
shakes him off, rises abruptly. He turns his back on them,
walking away a few steps.
Woody and Luke exchange a worried glance."|stage direction
132||EXT. LUKE'S STREET. LATER THAT NIGHT|location
133||"McConnell and Luke watch as Woody starts up his Corvette.
McConnell has regained his composure."|stage direction
134|LUKE|"Hey, Woodrow, isn't it about time
you donated this thing to a museum?"|speech
135||Woody revs the engine, which ROARS lustily. He grins.|stage direction
136|WOODY|"Internal combustion, boys. Accept no
substitutes."|speech
137||Luke laughs. Woody looks at McConnell.|stage direction
138|WOODY|"Jim, if there's ever... if there's
anything Terri and I can do --"|speech
139|MCCONNELL|I'm okay. Really. Thanks.|speech
140||Woody reaches out to shake Luke's hand.|stage direction
141|WOODY|"See you when I get to Mars, Luke.
Don't solve all the mysteries of the
universe, okay? Leave a little
something for the next guys."|speech
142|LUKE|"I'll see what I can do. Just make
sure you bring some fresh beer."|speech
143|WOODY|You got it.|speech
144||"With a final glance at McConnell, Woody slips the car into
gear. McConnell and Luke watch as he drives away. A silence.
Luke glances at his old friend, growing more serious. We
sense he's been waiting all night for a chance to say this."|stage direction
145|LUKE|"Should've been your mission, Jim.
Yours and Maggie's."|speech
146||McConnell, looking after Woody's car, becomes very still.|stage direction
147|LUKE|"None of us ever wanted Mars the way
you two did. Not even Woody. Twelve
years of hoping for this assignment,
training for it --"|speech
148|MCCONNELL|That's all over now.|speech
149|LUKE|"If Maggie hadn't gotten sick -- if
you hadn't pulled yourself out of
the rotation to take care of her --"|speech
150||"McConnell turns to him, his eyes flashing danger. He will
not tolerate pity. Luke sees this but presses on."|stage direction
151|LUKE|"No, I'm gonna say this. I have to
say it..."|speech
152||(pause)|location
153|LUKE|"I wanted Mars One. Hell, I battled
you for it every step of the way.
Never wanted to beat anybody so bad
in my life. But not like this...
Jim, I'd give this all up in a second,
if it would bring Maggie back to us."|speech
154||"McConnell is deeply moved, and for a moment doesn't trust
his own voice."|stage direction
155|MCCONNELL|"I know that, Luke. You don't have to
say it... Mars is yours now. Go get
it."|speech
156||(pause)|location
157|LUKE|Take care of yourself.|speech
158|MCCONNELL|Yeah. You too.|speech
159||"Luke nods. They grab hands for a second, then let go. Luke
walks back towards his house. McConnell watches him for a
moment, then turns, walks over to his Jeep. He opens his
door, then pauses. He turns. Looks up at --"|stage direction

itself, a tantalizing prize. But for him now, more distant
than ever. For him, perhaps, never to be attained.
CLOSE ON MCCONNELL'S FACE
As we see these thoughts going through him. After a moment
he looks down at
HIS SHOES
And the sandy verge of the front yard.
MCCONNELL'S EYES
Are a map of complex emotions: regret, injured pride, infinite
yearning. Gently, a bit self-consciously, HE LIFTS ONE SHOE

in the sandy soil...

mysterious and vivid as a fever dream. Dazzling sunlight. A
vast plain of rust-orange soil. Countless craters. Boulders
the size of houses, tossed about by the hands of gods. Twin
moons hanging in a salmon-pink sky. On the horizon, towering,
craggy peaks. And, at center -- the only sign of life -- a
small, mysterious, moving puff of dust.

interesting rock. Lettering on its side reads ""ARES-8.""

Suddenly Ares-8 pauses. Its video lens WHIRRS out, fine-tuning
focus, as it becomes intrigued by something OFFSCREEN -- a

with excitement."|stage direction

streambed, as Luke, in an EVA spacesuit, swings a clawed
rock hammer against a multi-layered, sedimentary rock face.
Reddish dust coats his bulky white suit. Despite that bulk,
he moves easily in the light Martian gravity (1/3 Earth's).
A hunk of rock breaks off, and Luke examines it more closely,
holding it up to his clear faceplate. He's very happy,
absorbed in this work, when his RADIO CRACKLES."|stage direction

Luke, gathered around some display monitors. They're in NASA
jumpsuits; the Hab has artificial atmosphere, enhanced
gravity, and heat. All are captivated by what they see. ON A
VIDEO SCREEN
We see a low-angle image of an elongated, rubble and dirt-
covered MOUNTAIN. Hard to tell scale, but it looks huge.
What's most striking, however, is a WHITE PEAK barely
protruding through the rubble two-thirds of the way along
the mountain's ridgeline. Its whiteness is in clear contrast
to the typical rust-orange of the surrounding rubble; what's
more, this strange little peak also displays an oddly-smooth,
multi-planed symmetry."|stage direction

incredulous, exasperated."|stage direction

he picked today's sector."|speech

duty to check that thing out."|speech

They all watch as he fine tunes the image, trying without
success to coax more resolution."|stage direction

we hit, and it's gotta be in the one
place guaranteed to make NASA look
ridiculous... You know how many books
have been written about that damned
mountain?"|speech

impact craters happen to look like

have every UFO kook on Earth spouting
off on the six o'clock news... C'mon,

cinder cone?"|speech

As the rover moves off across the rocky surface, dust kicking
up from the wheels, we get our first exterior glimpse of the
Mars One Base Camp. The main HAB UNIT looks like a huge tuna
can with a conical top section; it connects to a separate,
inflated-bubble GREENHOUSE. There's also an OXYGEN STILL,
PROPELLANT PLANT, and, on the other side, a couple hundred
meters distant, the massive ERV (Earth Return Vehicle), which
arrived as a separate, unmanned flight.

As we see the Mars One Base Camp: silent, very still. In the
distance, the massive ERV still looms, perched for takeoff,
the bottom rungs of its ladder buried.
PANNING
We see that sand has drifted high against the Hab, as well
as the sides of the partially-deflated tunnel and greenhouse,
and the four-man rover. The oxygen still and propellant plant
are almost buried. Solar panels, some of them punctured by
micrometeors, FLAP and CREAK eerily in the slight breeze.
And finally,
CLOSER TO CAMERA
We see the camp's American flag, still on its toppled pole,
but nearly obliterated by sand.
ANGLE ON MCCONNELL, TERRI, AND PHIL
Who are spooked by this desolation. They've paused at the
edge of the camp.
They have dragged along with them from their landing site a
crude sledge, improvised from the REMO's hatch cover and
some cargo straps. On this, their meager supplies.
McConnell, glancing at the others, knows he's got to keep
their spirits up. He kneels, digs out the flag pole. Brushing
off the sand, he rights this and re-plants it firmly in the
ground, packing the sand down with his boot. He stands for a
moment looking at the flag, his eyes moist. Despite the cost,
they have made it to Mars.

the leaves and the roof, then is captured and routed through
pipes of every shape and size, dripping into a clever
assortment of collection jars. Liquid water.
MCCONNELL
Reaches into a bucket, touches the water. His glove comes up
before his wondering eyes, dripping. Grasping the implication,
he looks down at his forearm instrument pad.
Blinking red letters read ""25 deg. C."" And something else --
the puffy white material of his suit is starting to slightly
deflate, revealing his arm's shape. There's air pressure in

MCCONNELL
Punches in more numbers, and gets the readout:
""Nitr. 78%/ 02 20%/ C02 1%/ Trace gasses 1%.""

jury-rigged environment, where a great deal of ingenuity has
come into play. He pauses, looking up...
Overhead, a bellows, stitched together from pieces of plastic
tarp, slowly inhales and exhales, pumping air into a vent in
the upper deck of the Hab. Its power comes from a crude water
wheel, a buckets-and-strut assemblage, tidily sutured with
duct tape, like some giant Erector set.
As McConnell turns away from this, still marvelling, a ragged
figure leaps through the foliage! It smashes into him, with
a HARSH SCREECH, knocking him to the ground.
McConnell, on his back, straddled by his attacker, fights
back as best he can. A blur of flailing arms and fists, as
he tries to push the creature away. Staring up, he catches a
glimpse of the almost unrecognizable
LUKE GRAHAM

HIGH, STRIATED WALL

down from somewhere overhead. The two sections meet and fuse

neatly as if he were in a giant, transparent mailing tube.
MCCONNELL
Fights against a stab of claustrophobia. Is he being

Widen in alarm. He strains against the sides of the cylinder

Slide helplessly across the smooth surface.

Looks down again.

Is up to his knees. Now his thighs...

Cranes his neck, staring up. Can he wedge himself higher,

The entire ""ceiling"" of the Face is becoming translucent. He
can see the dust storm, boiling overhead. And now, rising

this is a vortex of fire. As we watch, more fiery streaks

his unhelmeted face above the rising liquid.

his nose, his forehead. His whole body is submerged!

blinding flash; she's gone...
MCCONNELL'S FACE - IN THE PRESENT
Is shaking savagely; he is very near death. And then, all at
once, the SHAKING STOPS.
Time itself seems to stop.
McConnell opens his eyes, staring STRAIGHT AT US. And then,
fully accepting his fate, he throws his head back, opens his
mouth and takes in a deep lungful of the fluid. He can breathe
it.
His eyes widen in surprise and understanding. He can breathe
it! This fluid will keep him alive! His whole body relaxes,
the tension draining from his head and shoulders, as he fully
trusts this launch for the first time. And then, with his
eyes wide open, he sees, from memory, one final image...
