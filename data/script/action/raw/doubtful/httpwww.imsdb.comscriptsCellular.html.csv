TITLES OVER YELLOW BACKGROUND.
We PULL BACK to reveal we're looking at THE SUN. In the
distance lie the gorgeous San Gabriel Mountains and the
Downtown Los Angeles skyline.
In ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT, we CRANE PAST some trees to reveal
the vast expansive homes scattered in the hills of Brentwood.
HOMEOWNERS walk dogs, a PAPERBOY chucks papers fr9m a
gleaming mountain bike... It's early in the morning, and the
landscapers haven't come with their leaf blowers yet.
CONTINUE BOOMING DOWN to road level to face    the resplendent
Martin residence. We STEADICAM down the fr    ont walk, able to
admire the manicured hedges and the black E   scalade in the
driveway, to the front door decorated with    a whimsical
placard that reads, ""The Martins"" -- and we    pass THROUGH THE
KEYHOLE into the foyer."|unknown

athletic eleven year old boy, and we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE as
she comes down the stairs with a GOLDEN RETRIEVER at her
side.

6||"Yes Donna, I'm out the door.
We TRACK over the Woman's shoulder and follow her into the
kitchen, unable to see her face.
WOMAN (CONT'D)
Just inform Kayleigh that
anesthesia is on the way to prep
the epidural and I'll be there as
soon as I can.
Still looking over her shoulder, we watch her absently
straighten a PHOTOGRAPH of her son on the fridge as she
talks.
WOMAN (CONT'D)
And promise her she's about to have
a woooonnderful labor.
As the woman pours herself a fresh cup of coffee, her
HOUSEKEEPER enters the kitchen with a full laundry basket.
They give each other a silent wave.
WOMAN (CONT'D)
Right, I'll see you in twenty.
She hangs up her cordless and takes a breath as we COME
AROUND to finally REVEAL JESSICA MARTIN; slightly weary, but
ready for the day ahead.
JESSICA
Buenas dias, Rosario.
ROSARIO
Good morning Miss Jessica.
Jessica sees her answering machine blinking, hits PLAY.
In the background, a cheerful Rosario enters frame and heads
for the back door carrying the basket of laundry.
MALE VOICE
(on machine)
Honey? Honey, wake up.   Pick up the-
And as she brings the coffee cup to her lips--
SLAMM!! The door EXPLODES open and a squad of FIVE GUNMEN
storm in, wearing SKI-MASKS. Everything is a whirlwind of
quick cuts, noise and confusion.
Jessica's DOG starts to lunge at the men and -- thup! -- is
stilled by a silenced pistol before its second bark.
Rosario runs for the ALARM SYSTEM --
LEAD GUNMAN
Get away from there! Don't touch
that -- !!
-- but as she reaches out for the PANIC BUTTON -- BLAM!!     He
blows her away, too. The Gunman curses, then turns on
Jessica.
LEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D)
(dire)
Where is he?
Jessica cringes.
JESSICA
Where is who?
LEAD GUNMAN
Wrong answer.
The bastard hauls back and -- WHAM I -- punches her in the
face, knocking Jessica cold.
Then he turns to his men.
LEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D)
Search the house.
And as the answering machine fills the silence:
CRAIG VO
(on machine)
-I'll call back later.
The LEAD GUNMAN spins around, and we PUSH INTO the blackness
of his masked face.

8||"The BLACKNESS of a BLACK VAN and ESCALADE passing below us.
We quickly CRANE DOWN to see the vehicles traveling through:
An IRON GATE at the edge of an aband9ned property. They
bounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren trees--
ANGLE ON: THE KIDNAPPERS' VAN as it arrives at its
destination; an isolated HOUSE in the Hills. The grass is
dead. The trees are dead. It's the kind of place you could
scream for a week and no one would hear a thing.
As the van stops--
WE PUSH INTO ITS DOORS:"|unknown
9||INT. DARKENED ATTIC - KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE|location
10||"A door CRASHES open. Light slices through the dark revealing
the dusty, skeletal interior. Jessica is hurled into the
room and falls to the floor. With bound hands, she
frantically pulls her blindfold off to see--
THE LEAD SKI-MASKED KIDNAPPER
Standing in front of her.    Sturdier than the rest.   Solid.
Imposing.
JESSICA
Wh... what do you want?
Unsettlingly, the Kidnapper says nothing, staring at her.
Jessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze...
Then suddenly, the Kidnapper turns and exits the room.
Jessica breathes a sigh of relief...but it catches in her
throat as he returns ten seconds later -- with a BASEBALL BAT.
Grim as death, he stalks toward her --
JESSICA (CONT'D)
No, wait..
And reaching.her, he hauls back and SWINGS --
JESSICA (CONT'D)
NO!   PLEASE--//
SMASH! The bat connects with a wooden beam an inch above
Jessica's head, OBLITERATING the ROTARY DIAL TELEPHONE that
hung there.
As phone guts shower down on her, the Lead Kidnapper turns
and stomps away, slamming the attic door shut and locking
Jessica in the darkness.
Only now that they're gone does Jessica allow her fear to
show through. Trembling, tears running down her face,
Jessica finally breaks down, pleading to the empty attic--
JESSICA (CONT'D)
Wha... what the hell is happening?!
The attic's suffocating silence is the only answer she gets.
DISSOLVE TO:
THE OCEAN
Skimming along the water.

California, and at the center of it all, the SANTA MONICA
PIER."|unknown

12||"It would be a typical day, except for that some PEOPLE are
preparing for a ""HEAL THE BAY"" rally at the end of the pier.
VENDORS set up, preparing for the daily grind ahead.
BIKERS gather around a bad-ass HELLCAT G2 CONFEDERATE
MOTORCYCLE and admire its cutting-edge design.
HOT CHICKS in bikinis try on sunglasses at a stand.
FISHERMEN crack beers while awaiting the next bite."|unknown
13||INT. SANTA MONICA PIER - ARCADE - MORNING|location
14||"ANGLE ON - ARCADE GAME SCREEN.
The screen displays a car-race arcade game. A computer
generated hot-rod passes other racers at breakneck speed.
Playing the sit-down game, DAYTONA USA, is:
RYAN ACKERMAN, early twenties, looks like he grew up on the
beach without so much as a pot to piss in. His lethal
reflexes and bold recklessness, however, have made him a Jedi
Master of the game.
Ryan's score approaches the HIGH SCORE at the top of the
screen.
RYAN
You recording this?
CHAD (OS)
Yeah, sure...
CHAD, his best bud, aims a BLUE TOOTH VIDEOSTREAMING
CELLPHONE at some CUTE GIRLS instead. We can see their faces
on the tiny SCREEN of the cellphone.
Ryan's car gets caught behind a blue speedster, then passes
on the shoulder.
RYAN
Move, bitch.
He gets an EXTENDED PLAY and the screen flashes ""NEW RECORD.""
Nearby, a KID watching the game nods.
KID
Nice.
The HIGH SCORE starts rising to match Ryan's score.
RYAN
Get that?
Ryan turns around to see Chad has shoved the cellphone down
the front of his tattered shorts. And he's freeballing it.
CHAD
Check it; Attack of the Bubblegum
Monster in Hi-Def videostream-
RYAN
C'mon Chad, I gotta put my mouth on
that.
Holding a cup of soda between his teeth, Chad pulls the
cellphone out of his pants and hits ""SEND"".
CHAD
(through cup-holding
teeth)
Sweet. It's going to my email
right now.
S9me soda inadvertently SPILLS onto the cellphone and Chad
wipes it dry on his pants.
RYAN
Watch it dude, I gotta return that
thing in seven days.
CHAD
They aren't giving you shit yet?
RYAN
Nah, whenever I return it, I just
list off why the phone sucks and
they give me a new model. Figure
by the tenth time I'll have to go
somewhere else.
Ryan's car finally CRASHES in a wall of flames.       Game Over.
CUT TO:
THE OCEAN
As seen looking over the rail of the pier.      The tide is in,
but it's still a forty foot drop.
RYAN stares over the railing like a death row inmate
contemplating his last meal.
CHAD
Go already. No one's looking.
His left hand holds his WALLET.
CHAD (CONT'D)
(re: wallet)
Need me to hold that?
Ryan sticks it in the pocket of his surfer shorts -- he zips
a zipper, tucks a Velcro flap. Pats his pocket proudly.
RYAN
Waterproof.
But as soon as Ryan covertly CLIMBS ONTO THE RAIL, his left
leg starts trembling like crazy.
RYAN (CONT'D)
This is stupid. I could get
killed. Pick another dare.
Chad lowers the phone, irritated.
CHAD
My ass. Not after you made me
march in the Gay Pride Parade
wearing a thong.
RYAN
Screw it then. In one... Two...
Two and a half--
CHAD
Whole numbers only, Rabbitfoot.
Ryan stares at the waves crashing below. His leg starts
snaking like crazy... And he chickens out, hopping back to
the deck.
CHAD (CONT'D)
Just so you know, I'm emailing this
to every chick you ever met.
But suddenly Ryan's oblivious to the dare.   His eyes are
glued to something else--
CHAD (CONT'D)
(speaking like HAL 900)
Transmitting pussy file now.
CHLOE, early 20s, a head turner, confident, funny; she can
pull you in like a tractor beam. She and some CUTE FRIENDS
carry heavy cardboard boxes toward a table set up for the
""Heal The Bay"" rally.
Ryan walks over like he owns the place.
RYAN
Got any more? I'm here to help.
CHLOE
Thanks, but no, we got 'em all.
RYAN
What's in 'em?
Chloe opens the box.    Hands him a ""Heal The Bay"" pamphlet.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Cool, you're handing these out
during the concert?
CHLOE
Yeah, wanna help?
Ryan tries to ignore his thundering heart.
RYAN
Hell yeah.     I'm all about ""Heal the
Bay. ""
His eyes ricochet off the pamphlet in his hand.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Me an Chad do the monthly cleanup
thing, of course...
An awesome wing-man, Chad appears over Chloe's shoulder,
pretending to read a pamphlet, but really holding it up so
Ryan can see it. Piece of cake, now.
RYAN (CONT'D)
We've collected water samples with
the Stream Team, raised money on
the Promenade... I'm surprised I
haven't seen you.
He offers his hand.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Ryan.
She takes it.
CHLOE
Chloe.
The handshake lingers a second longer than necessary, and
they both smile at each other. Chad splits.
CHLOE (CONT'D)
I can't tell if you're full of it.
Ryan stops posturing, gets real.
RYAN
You ever go up to Santa Barbara?
My dad used to take me there all
RYAN (CONT'D)
the time. Their pier is amazing,
clear water, huge crabs everywhere,
oysters right there on the rocks,
starfish... Hard to believe it's
the same ocean sometimes.
He's managed to win her back.
CHLOE
Maybe you and I can take a break
later when Pat Benatar goes on.
RYAN
Sounds like a plan.
There's a moment...     Then --
CHLOE
Oh no -- I forgot. I still have to
pick up a box of T-shirts at the
Kinkos on Venice.
RYAN
I'll do it for you... if you want.
CHLOE
Seriously, you would?
RYAN
Sure.     How much is the bill?
CHLOE
Nothing.    It's been paid up front.
RYAN
Do you promise not to go anywhere?
CHLOE
Done.
Ryan makes a graceful exit.       Turns back.
RYAN
Okay, I won't be long.
CHLOE
(laughing)
Bye.
Ryan grabs Chad, and as they walk out of earshot:
RYAN
Dude, does Santa Barbara have a
harbor or a pier?

16||"A short time later, Ryan cruises through a Venice
neighborhood.
Ryan drives an early 70's Ford Bronco; clothes are strewn
across the backseat, and a box of ""Heal the Bay"" T-SHIRTS now
sits on the shotgun seat.
Ryan reaches into the glove box and pulls out a toothbrush.
He sips warm soda from a bottle and begins brushing.
Checking himself out in the mirror, he sniffs his pits, whoa,
and grabs the cellphone.
RYAN
(into phone)
Dex, wassup? You won't believe the
hotties I just met at the pier.
Smoking. You wanna meet them?
Yeah? Well don't get too excited
'cause I need my money.
Ryan stops at a red light.
RYAN (CONT'D)
Bullshit, you're not going
anywhere,
(quickly adding)
I'm pulling up right now.
Some AMBULANCES SPEED BY, SIRENS BLARING.   It's deafening.
Ryan lays on the horn.   When the light changes, Ryan peels
away angrily.
RYAN (CONT'D)
(covering his ear)
What? Yeah, you better be. And I
need your shower, I'm talkin' code
red stankage-
The CELLPHONE begins to CRACKLE with STATIC just as Ryan
drives under an OVERPASS.
Suddenly --
The car ahead of him STOPS in the middle of the street. Ryan
notices too late and has to jam on the brakes. The car
skids, he SCREAMS... and comes to a stop an inch before
hitting the other car's bumper.
He lifts the phone receiver to his ear but the call is WASHED
WITH STATIC.
RYAN (CONT'D)
(into phone)
Dex? You still there...?
And as has happened to all of us, he loses the call.

Greer sees Hodges gaping up the stairwell. Following his

She TWISTS the key and STOMPS the gas, sending the monster
SUV on a collision course with -- SMASHHH -- the guest house

Unable to open the door because of all the debris, Jessica
rolls down the window and yells to her son --

Ricky, please!
Somehow, the kid digs deep and finds the courage to run to
the Escalade, where his mother scoops him up into the cab
just as--
The kitchen door bursts open and Greer's team spills out into
the yard. They spot her instantly.
ELLIS

As they rush at her--

Jessica throws the big car in reverse and tries to back out --
but the Escalade's stuck! Caught by the debris, the wheels
just spin.
JESSICA
Come on!    COME ON!!
Jessica rocks the car forward, and back. Forward, and back.
And just as it finally comes loose -- KRRRAAASHHH!!
The window next to Jessica's head EXPLODES in a shower of
tempered glass, shocking us. Two arms snake in and wrap
around Jessica's neck. Greer.
But Jessica STOMPS ON THE GAS, hoping the big car will pull
her free.
It doesn't. As the Escalade surges away across the lawn,
Greer's vice-like grip holds, PULLING JESSICA OUT the broken
window and -- THUMP! -- to the guest house debris below.
As Jessica watches in horror:
THE DRIVERLESS ESCALADE
Careens down the driveway and crashes into a pillar.    Hodges
races over and yanks Ricky out.

A woman's HAND grabs the hood of Ryan's windbreaker and rips
it away from his face. Wheels him around. It's:
CHLOE
There you are! Where the hell were
you! ?
RYAN
Chloe!    Get away from here!
CHLOE
Know how many hours I waited for
you to bring back those stupid
shirts?! What'd you do? Sell them
on the Prominade yourself--?
But Ryan's got no time for this.
RYAN

A sickly-looking MOONEY glances at the commotion -- and sees
the hoodless Ryan.

That's him! There he is!

Ryan desperately tries to shoo Chloe away.
RYAN
It isn't safe to talk, get it? I --
People are after me!
CHLOE

What -- are you high?
Suddenly, Mooney steps up beside Ryan and grabs him.
MOONEY
(winded)
I've been..looking for..you, kid--
But Ryan struggles, thinking Mooney is with the bad guys.
Mooney grabs him as he tries to make a break for it.
RYAN
Let go of me! Sonofabitch, let go!
