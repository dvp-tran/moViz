mix of first class people: OLD MONEY in Gucci enjoying
freshly baked cookies, a MILLIONAIRE in jeans and a T-
shirt, BUSINESS PEOPLE relaxing after a tough day, and...
...a very nervous MAN.
Shifty-eyed. Alone in an aisle seat, the emergency row.
We hold on him for a moment, but not for too long. Then
we continue moving into --
THE COACH SECTION
Stopping at the lavatory, the ""OCCUPIED"" sign switches to
""VACANT"" and...
JAMES EARL JONES
(or actually, a James Earl Jones type, who for ease of
description, we'll simply refer to as James Earl Jones)
steps out of the restroom, in full African regalia:

the glass. She shrugs, leaving...
Pasqual to resume what he was doing. Slowly, he removes
a roll of Certs. He looks to Jones -- ""Well? What about
your end of the bargain?""
From within his dashiki, Jones pulls out a black velvet
pouch. He hands it to Pasqual, who opens it to find
diamonds. A helluva lot of diamonds. Pasqual smiles.
He hands the roll of Certs to Jones. It's not breath
candy at all, but a tiny roll of explosives, with a tiny,
high-tech triggering mechanism."|stage direction

They plummet, wind violently tearing at them. Pasqual's
frantic SCREAMS doppler quite nicely.

CLOSER - ON THAT BLACK SPECK
It's a jet helicopter. Its door opens, and now a SKYDIVER leaps
out, helmet down, arms back, streaking across the
sky in aerodynamic perfection, heading directly towards
JONES AND PASQUAL
who are still plummeting toward the earth at terminal
velocity. Jones begins to let go of Pasqual, who SCREAMS

stopping the wild dive directly behind Pasqual, and
immediately binds his arms and straps a parachute on him.
All three are still free-falling.
James Earl Jones nods at the Skydiver who, even under the
helmet and goggles, is clearly a beautiful woman.
Meet ALEXANDRA ""ALEX"" MUNDAY, one of Charlie's Angels.
She's a sultry bombshell -- a classic femme fatale --
only she's playing for the good guys.
She gives James Earl Jones a wink, then jerks Pasqual's
rip cord and -- WHOOMPH. Pasqual's chute deploys. He
flies upward, leaving --
Alex and James Earl Jones, both still falling.    Below the
ocean screams up at them. Not much time left.
James Earl Jones pulls his belt -- and his mufti flies
up. It's actually a tiny drogue chute, deploying his
entire dashiki. His outfit hides a parachute rig.
Alex pulls her own rip cord and -- WHOOMPH -- her chute
unfurls, and now...
Alex and James Earl Jones gently float towards --"|stage direction

But put her behind the wheel of any vehicle, and she's
unstoppable.
Natalie glances ahead, maneuvering the boat perfectly under
Alex, who drops on deck. Alex gathers her chute, then whips off
her helmet to give her cascading mane a wild shake.
Here comes James Earl Jones. Natalie guns the boat
underneath...a perfect catch. Alex helps him with his
dashiki-chute, and then all three look up...
Here comes Pasqual. Natalie whips the boat around,
catching him as he helplessly drops into the seats, still
bound, still scared out of his wits. He gapes wild-eyed
at the two Angels, then whirls on James Earl Jones."|stage direction

NATALIE, with a page-boy cut and wearing a Catholic
schoolgirl's uniform, sports glasses and braces; a bit
awkward and gangly, even shy.
ALEX, formally dressed with perfect pig-tails, is
sophisticated and self-possessed; a class act, even at ten.

their bosoms, Bosley nervously undoes his, revealing skin
