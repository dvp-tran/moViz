you that you that you was great back
here? Those guards! They thought they
was all of that. Then you showed up,

I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey,
wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll
stick with you. You're mean, green,
fightin' machine. Together we'll scare
the spit out of anybody that crosses
us."|speech
65||"Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very
loudly."|stage direction
66|DONKEY|"Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you
don't mind me sayin', if that don't
work, your breath certainly will get
the job done, 'cause you definitely
need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause
you breath stinks! You almost burned
the hair outta my nose, just like the
time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey
continues to talk, so Shrek removes
his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten
berries. I had strong gases leaking
out of my butt that day."|speech
67|SHREK|Why are you following me?|speech
68|DONKEY|"I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause
I'm all alone, There's no one here beside
me, My problems have all gone, There's
no one to deride me, But you gotta have
faith..."|speech
69|SHREK|"Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't
have any friends."|speech
70|DONKEY|"Wow. Only a true friend would be that
cruelly honest."|speech
71|SHREK|"Listen, little donkey. Take a look at
me. What am I?"|speech
72|DONKEY|"(looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really
tall?"|speech
73|SHREK|"No! I'm an ogre! You know. ""Grab your

78|DONKEY|Man, I like you. What's you name?|speech
79|SHREK|Uh, Shrek.|speech
80|DONKEY|"Shrek? Well, you know what I like about
you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me
thing. I like that. I respect that,
Shrek. You all right. (They come over
a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.)
Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live
in place like that?"|speech
81|SHREK|That would be my home.|speech
82|DONKEY|"Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful.
You know you are quite a decorator.
It's amazing what you've done with such
a modest budget. I like that boulder.
That is a nice boulder. I guess you
don't entertain much, do you?"|speech
83|SHREK|I like my privacy.|speech
84|DONKEY|"You know, I do too. That's another thing
we have in common. Like I hate it when
you got somebody in your face. You've
trying to give them a hint, and they
won't leave. There's that awkward silence.
(awkward silence) Can I stay with you?"|speech
85|SHREK|Uh, what?|speech
86|DONKEY|Can I stay with you, please?|speech
87|SHREK|(sarcastically) Of course!|speech
88|DONKEY|Really?|speech
89|SHREK|No.|speech
90|DONKEY|"Please! I don't wanna go back there!
You don't know what it's like to be
considered a freak. (pause while he
looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do.
But that's why we gotta stick together.
You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!"|speech
91|SHREK|Okay! Okay! But one night only.|speech
92|DONKEY|Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)|speech
93|SHREK|"What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto
a chair.) No! No!"|speech

late, swappin' manly stories, and in
the mornin' I'm makin' waffles."|speech
95|SHREK|Oh!|speech
96|DONKEY|Where do, uh, I sleep?|speech
97|SHREK|(irritated) Outside!|speech
98|DONKEY|"Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean,
I don't know you, and you don't know
me, so I guess outside is best, you
know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek
slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do
like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was
born outside. I'll just be sitting by
myself outside, I guess, you know. By
myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's
no one here beside me..."|speech

You! You're comin' with me."|speech

174|MIRROR|"(chuckles nervously) So, just sit back
and relax, my lord, because it's time
for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes.

one is a mentally abused shut-in from
a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi
and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies
include cooking and cleaning for her
two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella.
(shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette
number two is a cape-wearing girl from
the land of fancy. Although she lives
with seven other men, she's not easy.
Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and
find out what a live wire she is. Come
on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows
picture of Snow White) And last, but
certainly not last, bachelorette number
three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded
castle surrounded by hot boiling lava!
But don't let that cool you off. She's
a loaded pistol who likes pina colads
and getting caught in the rain. Yours
for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows

thing that happens at night."|speech

past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped.
As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger
beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll.

Shrek."|stage direction
224|HEAD GUARD|Shall I give the order, sir?|speech
225|FARQUAAD|"No, I have a better idea. People of
DuLoc, I give you our champion!"|speech
226|SHREK|What?|speech
227|FARQUAAD|"Congratulations, ogre. You're won the
honor of embarking on a great and noble
quest."|speech
228|SHREK|"Quest? I'm already in a quest, a quest
to get my swamp back."|speech
229|FARQUAAD|Your swamp?|speech
230|SHREK|"Yeah, my swamp! Where you dumped those
fairy tale creatures!"|speech
231|FARQUAAD|"Indeed. All right, ogre. I'll make you
a deal. Go on this quest for me, and
I'll give you your swamp back."|speech
232|SHREK|Exactly the way it was?|speech
233|FARQUAAD|Down to the last slime-covered toadstool.|speech
234|SHREK|And the squatters?|speech
235|FARQUAAD|As good as gone.|speech
236|SHREK|What kind of quest?|speech
237||"Time Lapse - Donkey and Shrek are now walking through the field
heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion."|stage direction
238|DONKEY|"Let me get this straight. You're gonna
go fight a dragon and rescue a princess
just so Farquaad will give you back
a swamp which you only don't have because
he filled it full of freaks in the first
place. Is that about right?"|speech
239|SHREK|"You know, maybe there's a good reason
donkeys shouldn't talk."|speech
240|DONKEY|"I don't get it. Why don't you just pull
some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle
him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds
his bones to make your bread, the whole
ogre trip."|speech
241|SHREK|"Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have
decapitated an entire village and put
their heads on a pike, gotten a knife,
cut open their spleen and drink their
fluids. Does that sound good to you?"|speech
242|DONKEY|Uh, no, not really, no.|speech
243|SHREK|"For your information, there's a lot
more to ogres than people think."|speech
244|DONKEY|Example?|speech
245|SHREK|"Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions.
(he holds out his onion)"|speech
246|DONKEY|(sniffs the onion) They stink?|speech
247|SHREK|Yes - - No!|speech
248|DONKEY|They make you cry?|speech
249|SHREK|No!|speech
250|DONKEY|"You leave them in the sun, they get
all brown, start sproutin' little white
hairs."|speech
251|SHREK|"No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres
have layers! Onions have layers. You
get it? We both have layers. (he heaves
a sigh and then walks off)"|speech
252|DONKEY|"(trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both
have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know,
not everybody likes onions. Cake! Everybody
loves cakes! Cakes have layers."|speech
253|SHREK|"I don't care... what everyone likes.
Ogres are not like cakes."|speech
254|DONKEY|"You know what else everybody likes?
Parfaits. Have you ever met a person,
you say, ""Let's get some parfait,"" they
say, ""Hell no, I don't like no parfait""?
Parfaits are delicious."|speech
255|SHREK|"No! You dense, irritating, miniature
beast of burden! Ogres are like onions!
And of story. Bye-bye. See ya later."|speech
256|DONKEY|"Parfaits may be the most delicious thing
on the whole damn planet."|speech
257|SHREK|You know, I think I preferred your humming.|speech
258|DONKEY|"Do you have a tissue or something? I'm
making a mess. Just the word parfait
make me start slobbering."|speech
259||"They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through
a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying
to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem,
so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out.
DRAGON'S KEEP
Shrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that's supposed to
house Princess Fiona. It appears to look like a giant volcano."|stage direction
260|DONKEY|"(sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that?
You gotta warn somebody before you just
crack one off. My mouth was open and
everything."|speech
261|SHREK|"Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd
be dead. (sniffs) It's brimstone. We
must be getting close."|speech
262|DONKEY|"Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking
about it's the brimstone. I know what
I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It
didn't come off no stone neither."|speech
263||"They climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There
is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where
the castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very
foreboding."|stage direction
264|SHREK|"Sure, it's big enough, but look at the
location. (laughs...then the laugh turns
into a groan)"|speech
265|DONKEY|"Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said
ogres have layers?"|speech
266|SHREK|Oh, aye.|speech
267|DONKEY|"Well, I have a bit of a confession to
make. Donkeys don't have layers. We
wear our fear right out there on our
sleeves."|speech
268|SHREK|Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.|speech
269|DONKEY|You know what I mean.|speech
270|SHREK|You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.|speech
271|DONKEY|"No, I'm just a little uncomfortable
about being on a rickety bridge over
a boiling like of lava!"|speech
272|SHREK|"Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside
ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll
just tackle this thing together one
little baby step at a time."|speech
273|DONKEY|Really?|speech
274|SHREK|Really, really.|speech
275|DONKEY|Okay, that makes me feel so much better.|speech
276|SHREK|Just keep moving. And don't look down.|speech
277|DONKEY|"Okay, don't look down. Don't look down.
Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't
look down. (he steps through a rotting
board and ends up looking straight down
into the lava) Shrek! I'm lookin' down!
Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me
off, please!"|speech
278|SHREK|But you're already halfway.|speech
279|DONKEY|But I know that half is safe!|speech
280|SHREK|"Okay, fine. I don't have time for this.
You go back."|speech
281|DONKEY|Shrek, no! Wait!|speech
282|SHREK|"Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance
then, shall me? (bounces and sways the
bridge)"|speech
283|DONKEY|Don't do that!|speech
284|SHREK|"Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? (bounces
the bridge again)"|speech
285|DONKEY|Yes, that!|speech
286|SHREK|"Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. (continues to
bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across
the bridge)"|speech
287|DONKEY|No, Shrek! No! Stop it!|speech
288|SHREK|You said do it! I'm doin' it.|speech
289|DONKEY|"I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek,
I'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground)
Oh!"|speech
290|SHREK|"That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. (walks
towards the castle)"|speech
291|DONKEY|"Cool. So where is this fire-breathing
pain-in-the-neck anyway?"|speech
292|SHREK|"Inside, waiting for us to rescue her.
(chuckles)"|speech
293|DONKEY|I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.|speech
294||INSIDE THE CASTLE|stage direction
295|DONKEY|You afraid?|speech
296|SHREK|No.|speech
297|DONKEY|But...|speech
298|SHREK|Shh.|speech
299|DONKEY|"Oh, good. Me neither. (sees a skeleton
and gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong
with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible
response to an unfamiliar situation.
Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might
add. With a dragon that breathes fire
and eats knights and breathes fire,
it sure doesn't mean you're a coward
if you're a little scared. I sure as
heck ain't no coward. I know that."|speech
300|SHREK|"Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up.
Now go over there and see if you can
find any stairs."|speech
301|DONKEY|"Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for
the princess."|speech
302|SHREK|"(putting on a helmet) The princess will
be up the stairs in the highest room
in the tallest tower."|speech
303|DONKEY|What makes you think she'll be there?|speech
304|SHREK|I read it in a book once. (walks off)|speech
305|DONKEY|"Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle
the stairs. I'll find those stairs.
I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs
won't know which way they're goin'.

Donkey is still talking to himself as he looks around the room."|stage direction

to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm

stairs. I wish I had a step right here.
I'd step all over it."|speech

Shrek spots a light in the tallest tower window."|stage direction

is, but where's the..."|speech

Shrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon
breathes fire."|stage direction

a hold of the dragons tail and holds
on) Got ya!"|speech

goes flying through the air and crashes through the roof of the
tallest tower. Fiona wakes up with a jerk and looks at him lying
on the floor."|stage direction

part of the bridge he's on."|stage direction

what large teeth you have. (the dragon
growls) I mean white, sparkling teeth.
I know you probably hear this all time
from your food, but you must bleach,
'cause that is one dazzling smile you
got there. Do I detect a hint of minty
freshness? And you know what else? You're
- - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure!
I mean, of course you're a girl dragon.
You're just reeking of feminine beauty.
(the dragon begins fluttering her eyes
at him) What's the matter with you?
You got something in your eye? Ohh.
Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay,
but you know, I'm, uh...(the dragon
blows a smoke ring in the shape of a
heart right at him, and he coughs) I'm
an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd
work out if you're gonna blow smoke
rings. Shrek! (the dragon picks him
up with her teeth and carries him off)
No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!"|speech
317||"FIONA'S ROOM
Shrek groans as he gets up off the floor. His back is to Fiona
so she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. She
then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off
the side table. She then lays back down and appears to be asleep.
Shrek turns and goes over to her. He looks down at Fiona for
a moment and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders
and shakes her away."|stage direction
318|FIONA|Oh! Oh!|speech
319|SHREK|Wake up!|speech
320|FIONA|What?|speech
321|SHREK|Are you Princess Fiona?|speech
322|FIONA|"I am, awaiting a knight so bold as to
rescue me."|speech
323|SHREK|Oh, that's nice. Now let's go!|speech
324|FIONA|"But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our
first meeting. Should it not be a wonderful,
romantic moment?"|speech
325|SHREK|Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.|speech
326|FIONA|"Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should
sweep me off my feet out yonder window
and down a rope onto your valiant steed."|speech
327|SHREK|"You've had a lot of time to plan this,
haven't you?"|speech
328|FIONA|(smiles) Mm-hmm.|speech
329||"Shrek breaks the lock on her door and pulls her out and down
the hallway."|stage direction
330|FIONA|"But we have to savor this moment! You
could recite an epic poem for me. A
ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!"|speech
331|SHREK|I don't think so.|speech
332|FIONA|Can I at least know the name of my champion?|speech
333|SHREK|Uh, Shrek.|speech
334|FIONA|"Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds
out a handkerchief) I pray that you
take this favor as a token of my gratitude."|speech
335|SHREK|Thanks!|speech
336||Suddenly they hear the dragon roar.|stage direction
337|FIONA|(surprised)You didn't slay the dragon?|speech
338|SHREK|"It's on my to-do list. Now come on!
(takes off running and drags Fiona behind
him.)"|speech
339|FIONA|"But this isn't right! You were meant
to charge in, sword drawn, banner flying.
That's what all the other knights did."|speech
340|SHREK|Yeah, right before they burst into flame.|speech
341|FIONA|"That's not the point. (Shrek suddenly
stops and she runs into him.) Oh! (Shrek
ignores her and heads for a wooden door
off to the side.) Wait. Where are you
going? The exit's over there."|speech
342|SHREK|Well, I have to save my ass.|speech
343|FIONA|What kind of knight are you?|speech
344|SHREK|"One of a kind. (opens the door into
the throne room)"|speech
345|DONKEY|"(os) Slow down. Slow down, baby, please.
I believe it's healthy to get to know
someone over a long period of time.
Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs
worriedly) (we see him up close and
from a distance as Shrek sneaks into
the room) I don't want to rush into
a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally
ready for a commitment of, uh, this
- - Magnitude really is the word I'm
looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that
is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what
are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just
back up a little and take this one step
at a time. We really should get to know
each other first as friends or pen pals.
I'm on the road a lot, but I just love
receiving cards - - I'd really love
to stay, but - - Don't do that! That's
my tail! That's my personal tail. You're
gonna tear it off. I don't give permission
- - What are you gonna do with that?
Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No.
No, no, no. No! Oh!"|speech
346||"Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings
toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks
up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head.
He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps
Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him.
Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt. She opens her eyes and
roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto
her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms
a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey
take off running. Very 'Matrix' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and
then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her."|stage direction
347|DONKEY|Hi, Princess!|speech
348|FIONA|It talks!|speech
349|SHREK|"Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's
the trick."|speech
350||"They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots
a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a
crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His
eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles
off and walks lightly."|stage direction
351|SHREK|Oh!|speech
352||Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.|stage direction
353|SHREK|"Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll
take care of the dragon."|speech
354||"Shrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the
castle. He throws the sword down in between several overlapping
chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that
is still around the dragons neck."|stage direction
355|SHREK|(echoing) Run!|speech
356||"They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot
pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons
breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on
for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They
are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look
in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to
get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the
dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs
quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a
sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away."|stage direction
357|FIONA|"(sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You
did it! You rescued me! You're amazing.
(behind her Donkey falls down the hill)
You're - - You're wonderful. You're...
(turns and sees Shrek fall down the
hill and bump into Donkey) a little
unorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed
is great, and thy heart is pure. I am
eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears
his throat.) And where would a brave
knight be without his noble steed?"|speech
358|DONKEY|"I hope you heard that. She called me
a noble steed. She think I'm a steed."|speech
359|FIONA|"The battle is won. You may remove your
helmet, good Sir Knight."|speech
360|SHREK|Uh, no.|speech
361|FIONA|Why not?|speech
362|SHREK|I have helmet hair.|speech
363|FIONA|"Please. I would'st look upon the face
of my rescuer."|speech
364|SHREK|No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.|speech
365|FIONA|But how will you kiss me?|speech
366|SHREK|"What? (to Donkey) That wasn't in the
job description."|speech
367|DONKEY|Maybe it's a perk.|speech
368|FIONA|"No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know
how it goes. A princess locked in a
tower and beset by a dragon is rescued
by a brave knight, and then they share
true love's first kiss."|speech
369|DONKEY|"Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait.
Wait. You think that Shrek is you true
love?"|speech
370|FIONA|Well, yes.|speech
371||Both Donkey and Shrek burst out laughing.|stage direction
372|DONKEY|You think Shrek is your true love!|speech
373|FIONA|What is so funny?|speech
374|SHREK|"Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?Fiona:
Of course, you are. You're my rescuer.
Now - - Now remove your helmet."|speech
375|SHREK|"Look. I really don't think this is a
good idea."|speech
376|FIONA|Just take off the helmet.|speech
377|SHREK|I'm not going to.|speech
378|FIONA|Take it off.|speech
379|SHREK|No!|speech
380|FIONA|Now!|speech
381|SHREK|"Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness.
(takes off his helmet)"|speech
382|FIONA|You- - You're a- - an ogre.|speech
383|SHREK|Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.|speech
384|FIONA|"Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is
all wrong. You're not supposed to be
an ogre."|speech
385|SHREK|"Princess, I was sent to rescue you by
Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who
wants to marry you."|speech
386|FIONA|Then why didn't he come rescue me?|speech
387|SHREK|"Good question. You should ask him that
when we get there."|speech
388|FIONA|"But I have to be rescued by my true
love, not by some ogre and his- - his
pet."|speech
389|DONKEY|Well, so much for noble steed.|speech
390|SHREK|You're not making my job any easier.|speech
391|FIONA|"I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem.
You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he
wants to rescue me properly, I'll be
waiting for him right here."|speech
392|SHREK|"Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all
right? (ominous) I'm a delivery boy.
(he swiftly picks her up and swings
her over his shoulder like she was a
sack of potatoes)"|speech
393|FIONA|You wouldn't dare. Put me down!|speech
394|SHREK|Ya comin', Donkey?|speech
395|DONKEY|I'm right behind ya.|speech
396|FIONA|"Put me down, or you will suffer the
consequences! This is not dignified!
Put me down!"|speech
397||"WOODS
A little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down. She just
hangs there limply while Shrek carries her."|stage direction
398|DONKEY|"Okay, so here's another question. Say
there's a woman that digs you, right,
but you don't really like her that way.
How do you let her down real easy so
her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't
get burned to a crisp and eaten?"|speech
399|FIONA|"You just tell her she's not your true
love. Everyone knows what happens when
you find your...(Shrek drops her on
the ground) Hey! The sooner we get to
DuLoc the better."|speech
400|DONKEY|"You're gonna love it there, Princess.
It's beautiful!"|speech
401|FIONA|"And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad?
What's he like?"|speech
402|SHREK|"Let me put it this way, Princess. Men
of Farquaad's stature are in short supply.
(he and Donkey laugh)"|speech
403||"Shrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off
the dust and grime."|stage direction
404|DONKEY|"I don't know. There are those who think
little of him. (they laugh again) Fiona:
Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're
just jealous you can never measure up
to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad."|speech
405|SHREK|"Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess.
But I'll let you do the ""measuring""
when you see him tomorrow."|speech
406|FIONA|"(looks at the setting sun) Tomorrow?
It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop
to make camp?"|speech
407|SHREK|"No, that'll take longer. We can keep
going."|speech
408|FIONA|But there's robbers in the woods.|speech
409|DONKEY|"Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting
to sound good."|speech
410|SHREK|"Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything
we're going to see in this forest."|speech
411|FIONA|I need to find somewhere to camp now!|speech
412||"Both Donkey and Shrek's ears lower as they shrink away from her.
MOUNTAIN CLIFF
Shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order. He shoves
a stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave."|stage direction
413|SHREK|Hey! Over here.|speech
414|DONKEY|"Shrek, we can do better than that. I
don't think this is fit for a princess."|speech
415|FIONA|"No, no, it's perfect. It just needs
a few homey touches."|speech
416|SHREK|"Homey touches? Like what? (he hears
a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona
who has torn the bark off of a tree.)"|speech
417|FIONA|"A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee
good night. (goes into the cave and
puts the bark door up behind her)"|speech
418|DONKEY|"You want me to read you a bedtime story?
I will."|speech
419|FIONA|(os) I said good night!|speech
420||"Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the
boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona
still inside."|stage direction
421|DONKEY|Shrek, What are you doing?|speech
422|SHREK|"(laughs) I just- - You know - - Oh,
come on. I was just kidding."|speech
423||"LATER THAT NIGHT
Shrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They are staring
up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations
to Donkey."|stage direction
424|SHREK|"And, uh, that one, that's Throwback,
the only ogre to ever spit over three
wheat fields."|speech
425|DONKEY|"Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future
from these stars?"|speech
426|SHREK|"The stars don't tell the future, Donkey.
They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut,
the Flatulent. You can guess what he's
famous for."|speech
427|DONKEY|I know you're making this up.|speech
428|SHREK|"No, look. There he is, and there's the
group of hunters running away from his
stench."|speech
429|DONKEY|"That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little
dots."|speech
430|SHREK|"You know, Donkey, sometimes things are
more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it."|speech
431|DONKEY|"(heaves a big sigh) Hey, Shrek, what
we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?"|speech
432|SHREK|Our swamp?|speech
433|DONKEY|"You know, when we're through rescuing
the princess."|speech
434|SHREK|"We? Donkey, there's no ""we"". There's
no ""our"". There's just me and my swamp.
The first thing I'm gonna do is build
a ten-foot wall around my land."|speech
435|DONKEY|"You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real
deep just now. You know what I think?
I think this whole wall thing is just
a way to keep somebody out."|speech
436|SHREK|No, do ya think?|speech
437|DONKEY|Are you hidin' something?|speech
438|SHREK|Never mind, Donkey.|speech
439|DONKEY|"Oh, this is another one of those onion
things, isn't it?"|speech
440|SHREK|"No, this is one of those drop-it and
leave-it alone things."|speech

across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along
with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles
to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too
big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but
she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona
