2||INT. VICTORIAN ESTATE - 1895 - DAY|location|||
3||"CLOSE UP: Ornate antique GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes 2:15.
The credits begin to roll.
Calligraphy place cards are painstakingly hand-written in
preparation for a formal reception.
Servants meticulously clean an elaborate crystal chandelier.
Hands rapidly shine silver cutlery.
Fresh flowers arranged in several enormous vases."|stage direction|||
4||INT. KITCHEN - DAY|location|||
5||"Kitchen clock strikes 2:15.
Poultry plucked. Feathers everywhere.
Steaming copper pots boiling over. Platters prepared with
decorative garnish.
Extravagant tiered cake is lavishly iced. A glob of frosting
enters a pair of puckered lips. The perpetrator, a fey,
pompous, HEAD VALET, seriously considers the texture and
flavor of the icing, then gives the PASTRY CHEF a withering,
sour look.
The valet, oblivious to the chef's fury, gathers a prepared
silver breakfast tray and checks his pocket watch. 2:15."|stage direction|||
6||INT. BEDROOM - DAY|location|||
7||"Antique bedside table clock -- just past 2:15. The valet
throws open velvet drapes, sunlight FLOODS the room revealing
a figure sleeping soundly in a massive oak framed bed. The
valet puts down the tray, pulls back the quilt.
The dozing figure gives the valet a deliberate, angry KICK.
Flinching infinitesimally, the valet crosses to the closet,
selects three suits and holds them up for inspection. From
beneath the puffiest of pillows, AN EYE reluctantly opens. A
weary arm points decisively to the riding outfit."|stage direction|||
8||EXT. ESTATE - DAY|location|||
9||"The riding outfit is adorned by LEOPOLD, Duke of Albany, a
dashing, virile man in his 30's. GALLOPING with great abandon,
he expertly leads his horse up hills and over hedges. He
sends gardeners shaping the grounds fleeing from his path.
In the background, lanterns are being strung throughout the
estate. Rugs are beaten out of open windows."|stage direction|||
10||INT. HALLWAY - EVENING|location|||
11||"Large hallway clock -- 6:15. A pair of boots track a freshly
scrubbed floor as Leopold heads carelessly up the stairway.
Three steps behind, the valet snaps his fingers signaling
the staff to clean up the mess.
SERIES OF CLOSE UPS
Gaudily framed portraits of somber relations.
A bird sits listless in a gilded cage.
Hot water is poured into a bath.
Carriages begin to arrive.
Orchestra leader signals the musicians to play.
Guests fill the ballroom in formal attire."|stage direction|||
12||INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT|location|||
13||"Leopold stares haughtily into a full length mirror.
He wears only dotted linen drawers and a black silk top hat
of the period. He flexes slightly. The valet hastily fastens
a corset around his mid-section from behind.
Leopold eyes his reflection seductively. He becomes bored.
He turns to his right. The valet spoons sorbet from a silver
saucer into his mouth. He turns back to the mirror to watch
himself eat. The valet pats his mouth dry.
He affects a pampered STRUT, crossing the room as the valet
sprays a mixture of perfume and powder into the air. Leopold
thrusts out his arms walking through the mist, turns and
saunters back to his favorite place, in front of the mirror.
Finally, as if weighing a great decision, Leopold hands his
hat to his valet and nods firmly into the mirror.
CLOSE UP
Fine linen undervest slides over his head.
Black twilled worsted trousers pulled up to his waist.
The buttoning of his hard, white, roll collar.
A cream suede glove stitched in black slides over his hand.
A perfect tight bow tie is tied around his neck.
An elegant black tuxedo jacket with silk facings and tails
to the knees is fitted to his torso.
His hair is sleeked with oil and centrally parted.
His eyebrows are brushed with a tiny silver comb.
His cheeks are pinched.
A red silk handkerchief is placed in the bosom of his lapel.
Leopold stares into the mirror. The effect is DAZZLING. He
raises one eyebrow. Then, in a voice you could pour over a
waffle:"|stage direction|||
14|LEOPOLD|"You dance like a herd of cattle,
Miss Fairchild. You are a rare woman
who lights up the room... simply by
leaving it."|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
15||"He bows. As he rises, the reflection of Leopold's UNCLE OTTO,
a pampered, effectual man in his 60's, appears behind Leopold
in the looking glass."|stage direction|||
16|UNCLE OTTO|"Tell me Leopold, do you plan to join
us downstairs after completing this
one-sided flash of wit?"|speech|UNCLE OTTO|M|True
17|LEOPOLD|"I despise affairs of this sort, Uncle
Otto. No one really listens to anyone
else. If you attempt it, you will
see why."|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
18|UNCLE OTTO|"You judge everything too severely. I
wonder what would happen if you were
to cast that critical eye inward?"|speech|UNCLE OTTO|M|True
19|LEOPOLD|"You do not wonder at all. You merely
ask in order to state your own
opinion."|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
20|UNCLE OTTO|We are all concerned about you.|speech|UNCLE OTTO|M|True
21|LEOPOLD|Ahh, here it comes.|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
22|UNCLE OTTO|"Your life does not seem to have any
direction. At the age of 25 a man is
too young to do anything well. At 35
he is too old. Now is your time to
take action. Tell me, what is it you
want to DO with your life?"|speech|UNCLE OTTO|M|True
23||(wearily)|location|||
24|LEOPOLD|I do not know.|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
25||(just as weary)|location|||
26|UNCLE OTTO|Your ignorance cramps my conversation.|speech|UNCLE OTTO|M|True
27||"(he slaps Leopold's
face twice rather
quickly)"|location|||
28|UNCLE OTTO|"Wake up! This is your one and only
life. Every man has the chance to
make a difference. DO something!"|speech|UNCLE OTTO|M|True
29||Leopold, stung, takes a moment to compose himself.|stage direction|||
30|LEOPOLD|"I am most grateful for your
surveillance and for your sympathy.
I assure you there is no need for
concern. I am as effectual and
attentive... as my position allows."|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
31|UNCLE OTTO|"Life is not position, Leopold. It is
action."|speech|UNCLE OTTO|M|True
32||"(he straightens
Leopold's tie)"|location|||
33|UNCLE OTTO|"I will see you downstairs promptly.
In the appropriate frame of mind."|speech|UNCLE OTTO|M|True
34||"He leaves. Leopold stares into the mirror, snaps his fingers.
The valet hands him a glass and pours a small shot of brandy.
Leopold shoots him a look. The valet fills the glass higher.
Leopold drains the glass and heads to the doorway. He
hesitates, taking a deep breath and a long pause. Finally..."|stage direction|||
35||(grandly)|location|||
36|THE VALET|Go spread joy.|speech|THE VALET|M|
37||Without looking back, Leopold leaves the room.|stage direction|||
38||INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT|location|||
39||"Music fills the air as the creme de la creme of Victorian
society gather inside. Leopold holds a prearranged dance
card. He looks at the names and finds his first partner is
MISS TREE. Leopold looks upward helplessly at an unrelenting
God."|stage direction|||
40||INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT|location|||
41||"A profoundly self-conscious Leopold dances energetically
into frame with MISS TREE, an ancient, elfin, yet amazingly
SPRY woman who gapes up at him searchingly, unblinking.
Leopold opens his mouth to speak, can think of nothing
suitable to say, and clamps his mouth shut. They dance out
of frame."|stage direction|||
42||INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT|location|||
43||"Leopold dances into frame with CLARA, a BEAUTIFUL girl of
19. He glances at her and smiles. She titters, turning away
shyly. They whirl around the dance floor. His smile grows
into a broad grin. Caught up in the excitement, Clara beams
up at him... happily revealing a mouth full of missing, inky
teeth.
Leopold, face frozen in a formal smile, dances on."|stage direction|||
44||INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT|location|||
45||"Leopold lumbers into frame with MISS FAIRCHILD, a woman of
immense girth. With great dignity and extreme difficulty he
maneuvers her around the floor, looking everywhere except
her enormous bosom."|stage direction|||
46|LEOPOLD|"You dance like an angel, Miss
Fairchild. You light up the room. I
thank you."|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
47||"Miss Fairchild curtseys heavily. Leopold glances at his card,
sees the name Miss Serena Clacket and shudders.
He spots a VERY LOVELY WOMAN hidden amongst the guests. She
scribbles in a small note pad, occasionally glancing around.
Hiding his dance card, he saunters over."|stage direction|||
48|LEOPOLD|"Good evening. I do not believe I
have had the pleasure."|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
49||"The young woman stares vacantly at Leopold until she realizes
he is addressing her. She puts her pad away."|stage direction|||
50|CARLSON|...Julia Carlson.|speech|CARLSON|F|True
51||Leopold takes her hand and kisses it gently.|stage direction|||
52|CARLSON|I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?|speech|CARLSON|F|True

59||"(looking around the
room)"|location|||
60|CARLSON|Well it's not home but it's much...|speech|CARLSON|F|True
61||"Leopold regards her curiously. The orchestra starts up. There
is a hubbub amongst the guests."|stage direction|||
62|LEOPOLD|Shocking! The TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY.|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
63|CARLSON|"The? Oh, that's from Paris, isn't
it?"|speech|CARLSON|F|True
64|LEOPOLD|It is a scandal nonetheless.|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
65||Leopold spots Uncle Otto observing him from across the room.|stage direction|||
66|LEOPOLD|Miss Carlson, do me the honor?|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
67|CARLSON|I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer.|speech|CARLSON|F|True
68||(smiling seductively)|location|||
69|LEOPOLD|"Truly I would be in your debt. Any
admonition would be erased simply by
presenting a partner as lovely as
yourself."|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
70|CARLSON|No, no. Really, I...|speech|CARLSON|F|True
71||"Leopold stiffly holds out his arm. A beat. Carlson, stuck,
takes it WITH HESITATION and is escorted to the dance floor.
They dance. ALL but Leopold and Carlson gaily sing ""TA-RA-RA-
BOOM-DE-AY."" Leopold, flushed, looks quite smitten. Carlson,
shy at first, eventually smiles brightly."|stage direction|||
72|LEOPOLD|"I suppose we really ought to sing
along."|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
73||(embarrassed)|location|||
74|CARLSON|Oh, golly.|speech|CARLSON|F|True
75||"They half sing, half speak the TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY, their
emphasis on ""BOOM."" Laughing giddily, their dancing becomes
freer, picking up speed. The room SPINS. Finally:"|stage direction|||
76||(breathless)|location|||
77|CARLSON|"Thank you for the dance. It was
lovely. I hope it wasn't too awful
for you."|speech|CARLSON|F|True
78|LEOPOLD|Not at all. It was most enlightening.|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
79||"There is a slight pause. The Grandfather CLOCK strikes
midnight."|stage direction|||
80|CARLSON|I really must be going.|speech|CARLSON|F|True
81|LEOPOLD|I won't hear of it.|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
82||(moving away from him)|location|||
83|CARLSON|No, I'm quite late as it is.|speech|CARLSON|F|True
84|LEOPOLD|I shall see you to the door...|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
85||"(stopping him
resolutely)"|location|||
86|CARLSON|"You're very sweet. I had a wonderful
time."|speech|CARLSON|F|True
87||"(she watches him,
memorizing his face.
Then firmly)"|location|||
88|CARLSON|Goodbye.|speech|CARLSON|F|True
89||"Leopold takes a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. He
watches Carlson pass through the crowd and out the courtyard
door. He surveys the room. After a moment he follows her."|stage direction|||
90||EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT|location|||
91||"Leopold makes his way through the manicured garden in the
dark. He hears an EERIE METALLIC SOUND. He slows down, brushes
back the thicket. The silhouette of a woman is revealed. She
is once again writing in her notebook."|stage direction|||
92|LEOPOLD|Miss Carlson?|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
93||"Carlson spins around quickly, panicked. Leopold STOPS.
Partially hidden in the brush, a sleek, oddly shaped,
MECHANICAL device. It's door open, lit from within, casting
a weird glow."|stage direction|||
94|LEOPOLD|Good God...|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
95|CARLSON|What are you...? You frightened me.|speech|CARLSON|F|True
96||"Leopold moves toward the contraption and is about to touch
it..."|stage direction|||
97|LEOPOLD|What sort of mechanism is this?|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
98||Carlson shakes her head, unsure of how to proceed.|stage direction|||
99|LEOPOLD|Answer me!|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
100|CARLSON|It's perfectly all right. It's...|speech|CARLSON|F|True

Carlson FREEZES."|stage direction|||
102||"(carefully,
deliberately)"|location|||
103|CARLSON|"Listen to me. Please. Move very
slowly. Step out of the machine.
Step out and I'll explain whatever
you want to know."|speech|CARLSON|F|True
104|LEOPOLD|What is this? Who are you?|speech|LEOPOLD|F|True
105||His hand comes to rest on a glowing red lever.|stage direction|||
106|CARLSON|Oh, God.|speech|CARLSON|F|True
107||"She YANKS on his arm. Instinctively he pulls away,
accidentally thrusting the lever into action. Carlson falls
from the machine."|stage direction|||
108||(suddenly frantic)|location|||
109|CARLSON|Get out of there! Get out now!|speech|CARLSON|F|True

creme de la creme have gathered and dance. Kate overwhelmed,
rushes down an elaborate staircase. Half way down she looses
a shoe. She hesitates briefly then continues to the dance
floor.
In the center of the floor, Leopold, looking very
distinguished and attractive, dances with a flirtatious young
woman. Try as she might, Leopold keeps her at a distance."|stage direction|||

1783||"The music changes: A LIVELY CHARLESTON. Leopold heaves a
sigh of relief and makes his way through the crowd, up the
staircase.
The dancers become an intricate maze, a dead end at every
turn as Kate searches each male face.
In the foreground, Leopold is stopped by a woman midway up
the stairs. As they chat, Leopold reaches down and picks up
the muddy slipper, offering it to her. She turns in a huff,
flouncing down the stairs.
Simultaneously, in the background, Kate desperately looks
for Leopold.
Leopold studies the slipper as he makes his way up the stairs.
He slows down, hesitates and STOPS. Very slowly he turns
around. He becomes very still. TEARS well up in his eyes.
The ballroom clock strikes MIDNIGHT.
Kate climbs an opposite staircase to get a better view then
STOPS. In her heart SHE KNOWS. Slowly she turns. Leopold
stands quietly at the bottom of the stairs, gazing up at
her. He extends his arm, showing her THE RING. He offers her
his hand.
The crowd, the room, THE WORLD AROUND THEM, DISAPPEAR. Their
eyes lock. As she descends the staircase, THE YEARS MELT
AWAY. Kate's short hair grows long, cascading around her
shoulders. The fine lines around Leopold's face are gone.
They see themselves through each other's eyes, at the moment
of youth, when they fell in love.
Leopold bends down, places the slipper on Kate's foot. He
rises, looks down at his hands and then up at Kate. His hands
are caked with mud. She smiles helplessly. Not caring, he
wraps his arms tightly around her.
MUSIC begins to play, a slow waltz. He nods to her. She takes
a deep breath. Her head bobs in rhythm. She begins to count
silently. Leopold smiles, counting along.
THEY DANCE...
An elderly couple watch Leopold with interest."|stage direction|||

1786||"Kate and Leopold dance past. They are older. As they gaze
into each other's eyes, they twirl. THE LOOK OF YOUTH RETURNS.
At the center of the floor they stop dancing. THEY KISS. The
rest of the world dances around them.
Over this background... THE SCRAPBOOK PICTURES BLEED ONTO
SCREEN.
The old formal wedding photo becomes a photograph of Kate
and Leopold the perfect bride and groom, both discreetly
point to their rings.
Kate stands with Leopold as he establishes a scholarship for
studies in physics.
The old photograph of Leopold and Albert Einstein changes to
include Kate, waving and smiling broadly for the camera.
The professional photograph becomes a double portrait. It
shows the two in their 70's, sitting regally in matching
chairs. They hold hands and smile serenely. Staring directly
into the camera, they show off their rings.
SLOWLY the scrapbook closes...
Kate and Leopold dance, the music swells as they become lost
in the crowd. The clock CHIMES. Slowly we..."|stage direction|||
