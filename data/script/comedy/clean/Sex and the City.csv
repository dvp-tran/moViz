202   EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- DAY -- SPRING                        202
Forsythia bushes are in bloom. Carrie and Miranda walk. They
carry sandwiches.
MIRANDA
So, we're done with our last
session and we're not allowed to
talk for two weeks while we figure
out if being together again is
something we really want. And then -
- we had to pick a place to meet --
and if we both show up on that day -
- the past no longer exists.
Showing up is the promise we make
to each other that we're willing to
let it all go and move forward.
124.
CARRIE
Can you do that?
MIRANDA
I don't know. I have a lot of
thinking to do.
CARRIE
Thinking -- or feeling?
MIRANDA
What do you mean?
CARRIE
Miranda -- you're a lawyer. You can
argue both sides of any case --
but, why we feel what we feel --
isn't logical. It's emotional.
Sorry, Harvard -- I'm afraid you're
going to have to make this decision
based on your emotions.
MIRANDA
Well, then -- I'm screwed. I don't
know what I feel.
CARRIE
You will. There will come a moment
when you'll know. And if it's: yes -
- all that brilliant logic will go
out the window... with the past.
MIRANDA
And I thought picking the place to
meet was a challenge.
CARRIE
Where is it?
MIRANDA
The Brooklyn Bridge. Halfway
between both our places.
CARRIE
Very logical. And yet poetic.
MIRANDA
Poetic -- if we both show up.
Otherwise -- you're on a bridge --
rejected. Not a good plan.
