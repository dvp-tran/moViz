3||"GUIDO
You kill your film several times,
mostly by talking about it. A film is
a dream. You kill it writing it down,
you kill it with a camera; the film
might come to life for a moment or two
when your actors breathe life back
into it - but then it dies again,
buried in film cans. Mysteriously,
sometimes, in the editing room, a
miracle happens when you place one
image next to another so that when,
finally, an audience sits in the dark,
if you're lucky -- very lucky - and
sometimes I've been lucky - the dream
flickers back to life again. That's
why I'm secretive.

Good luck, Maestro."|unknown
9||"Departing, he closes the soundstage door.
As the man crosses the shadowy stage, a dim shaft of
light catches his face, weary, handsome, haggard.
GUIDO CONTINI, the most famous film director in the
world. In front of him:
AN ENORMOUS, DUSTY, MULTI-LEVEL FILM SET under
construction. A complex maze of scaffolding, its
unfinished, chaotic elements suggesting ancient ruins.
Cracked stone facades, broken columns, open
platforming, the skeleton of a grand staircase.    A
lighting grid, not yet hung, and a camera crane
surrounded by a forest of studio lights on stands."|stage direction
10||p. 2|unknown
11||"Guido sits at the table, lights up a cigarette and puts
on his glasses. He looks at the plans, looks up at the
stage, puts his glasses down and stands up, stepping
over to the crane.
Guido, alone, cigarette hanging from the corner of his
mouth, contemplates the studio, its turbulent set, in
every sense a jumble of ideas.
Guido looks at the set in despair. He sits in the
bucket seat of the crane, buries his head in his hands,
overwhelmed.

How do you begin? How do you begin
this thing? Page 1... Page 1... Page
1... Page nothing..."|speech
13||"In the distance, a figure approaches out of the
darkness, the darkness of Guido's imagination. An
escape from his tortured reality.
The figure emerges gradually, like a goddess. She is
gorgeous, imposing, and seductive. She is CLAUDIA, his
film star, his muse. When Claudia reaches Guido, she
stops in front of him, takes his hands from his face,
and kisses him. And with that gesture, the music
swells, the lighting grid rises majestically into the
air, the gritty soundstage transforms into something
beautiful, transforms into the interior world of
GUIDO'S FANTASY.
As Claudia moves away, more and more women slowly
appear. They emerge from everywhere. These are the
women from Guido's life, past and present. Women from
his films, women he has loved, the sources of his
inspiration and creative genius.
A grand OVERTURE unfolds. The most significant women
in Guido's life are revealed, each with their own
powerful entrance:
LUISA, his wife
CARLA, his mistress
LILLI, his costume designer and accomplice
GUIDO'S MAMMA, her spirit
STEPHANIE, a fashion journalist
SARAGHINA, a whore"|stage direction

as the studio's truck doors are yanked open, jolting
Guido who is slumped in the crane seat. Harsh daylight
penetrates the gloom. Too bright. He blinks,
discombobulated, as a group of silhouetted figures
approach with purpose. One of the figures is a well-
fed, amiable character, DANTE. He is Guido's longtime
associate and Producer. A younger, more ascetic figure
accompanies him, sharp and birdlike. This is FAUSTO, an
accountant. Dante speaks quickly and without obvious
punctuation:"|stage direction
