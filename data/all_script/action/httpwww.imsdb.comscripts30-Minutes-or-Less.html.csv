calling in saying you ripped them off.
Promised to buy them beer or something."|speech

can into the bushes and gets to work on his fourth beer.
He looks over at a parked Hyundai Elantra. A YOUNG MAN sits
in the passenger seat with a pensive look on his face. He
makes a sudden, surprised gasp. The homely YOUNG WOMAN who
was just blowing him sits up from his lap and rearranges
herself in the driver seat. She leans over for a goodbye
kiss. The Young Man obliges with much fanfare.
The Young Man gets out and the car pulls away. This is CHET

Outkast's ""Ms. Jackson."" He stops when he notices Will in

Will looks down at his coffee table. Clears some magazines
to reveal a file folder. Flips the cover -
It's full of college applications, drafts of admissions essays,
a junior college transcript. Will thumbs through one of the
glossy applications. The kids look young. Very young.
Will glances over at a picture on his wall: he and Chet at
high school graduation, looking just as young. They have
their arms around a pretty girl squeezed between them. Will
and the girl look very high and very happy.

evil: me shaving a few years off The
