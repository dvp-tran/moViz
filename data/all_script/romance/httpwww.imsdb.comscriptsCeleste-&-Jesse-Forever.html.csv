out?"|speech
134|JESSE|"No, of course not. You're my best
friend."|speech
135|CELESTE|"Yeah you too. I mean, we can't not

10th grade when you went to Space
Camp Canada."|speech
136|JESSE|"Yeah, that was 6 weeks of torture.

149|CELESTE|Love you too.|speech
150||8 INT. CELESTE'S HOUSE-MORNING 8|stage direction
151|CELESTE|"Celeste's morning symphony is under way. She sits in front of
a bowl of oatmeal, a bowl of berries, a cup of coffee, 4
neatly stacked newspapers, her laptop and the television
tuned to CNN. She methodically eats, sips her coffee, reads
the paper, watches TV, and surfs the internet. She is clearly
a culture vulture. Jesse walks by outside his studio and does
the ""C and J"" sign to Celeste. She does it back
instinctively. Is it weird that we hang out so much? She
shakes it off and titters. She's being ridiculous; it's fine."|speech
152||9 INT. COFFEE BEAN- MORNING 9|stage direction
153|CELESTE|"Celeste walks in, dressed impeccably. Again, in all black.

to let it go, but she can't."|stage direction
166|BUSINESS MAN|"Well, she was looking at the
pastries, I didn't think she was
ready to order."|speech
167|CELESTE|"Well, it's not just her. It's
everyone behind her too. So, if you
want to ask all these people if
it's okay to cut in front of them
because you are late, be my guest.
Just don't assume that your time is
more important than everyone
else's."|speech

large glass slabs, separate the offices from each other.
Celeste is on camera, in the middle of conducting a live
satellite interview for MSNBC."|speech

an unrelenting appetite for
processed junk food, talentless pop
stars like Riley Banks and recycled
movie franchises like Transformers.
The more we consume crap, the more
we want crap."|speech

176|CUT TO:|Rachel Maddow is conducting the interview in studio.|speech
177|RACHEL MADDOW|"Sounds utterly hopeless. Is there
an upshot?"|speech
178|CELESTE|"I think there will be a groundswell
movement towards simplicity.
People will start to listen to
their most rudimentary needs-- they
will crave mental, spiritual and
physical nourishment. It's back to
basics."|speech
179|RACHEL MADDOW|"Wow, a lot to chew on. Well, thanks
for being with us today. You're
great, come back any time. For more

last night."|speech
184|SCOTT|Who's that?|speech
185|CELESTE|"Tucker and Beth. They're such
dicks. They left in protest because
they think Jesse and I are being
""unhealthy."" So judgy, right? We're
fine."|speech
186|SCOTT|You're only done when you're done.|speech
187|CELESTE|"Spare me the spiritual platitudes,
Scotty. If we were gay,(she motions
to Scott) no one would even
question us being friends!"|speech
188|SCOTT|"You and Jesse are clearly not ready
to let each other go. And there's
nothing wrong with that."|speech
189|CELESTE|"Yeah there's nothing wrong with
that. I mean, what do you think?"|speech
190|SCOTT|"Well, to be honest...
Celeste looks at an e-mail her blackberry and interrupts."|speech
191|CELESTE|"Wait, we're signing Riley Banks??
When were you going to tell me?? I
just trashed her on Rachel Maddow.
Great.
16."|speech
192|SCOTT|"Yeah, that's why I wanted you to
come in. It's a huge account.."|speech
193|CELESTE|"Scott, you and I built this company
so we wouldn't have to take an
account like Riley Banks."|speech
194|SCOTT|"Well, you and I may not have a
company if we don't take Riley
Banks. Recession, remember?"|speech
195|CELESTE|She's like a...soul-less hologram.|speech
196|SCOTT|"She is releasing a new album. She
wants us to do the branding and
merchandising. We need to take this
account."|speech

198||Celeste starts to heads out.|stage direction
199|SCOTT|"If you are looking for my opinion,
I do think you should start dating."|speech

will show up. And I'm still on
track for my 25 year plan."|speech
201|SCOTT|"No one has a 25 year plan. Except
for my mortgage company."|speech
202|CELESTE|"First child at 33. Second at 35.
Which means I will only be 56 at my
eldest's college graduation. The
bad news is that I may not be at my
4th grandchild's high school
graduation. But that's okay, I
guess."|speech
203|SCOTT|"I'm fascinated with the mentally
ill.
17."|speech
204|CELESTE|I've got time. I'm not worried.|speech
205|SCOTT|"Well, do me a favor and get your
fuck on before you meet the next
guy.
Celeste looks at Scott in shock."|speech
206|CELESTE|What are you doing?|speech

brutal. And no one's talking about
it."|speech

213|SKILLZ|"Not for long, dude. Have you been
to those weed pharmacies? They're
killing me. I gotta branch out.
Maybe start working in
methamphetamines? Or maybe teach
pre-school. I always wanted to do
that. I love kids.
Skillz is distracted by something.
SKILLZ (CONT'D) (CONTD)
Sorry, I know this is serious talky
time but would you look at the
fucking seat on that girl?

be over. It goes on forever. It's
like space. So great."|speech

just confused and overwhelmed right
now about everything. But she'll
come around. She always does."|speech

think it's over, bro. It may be
time to accept that and move on.
Call that dime Veronica."|speech

months after Celeste and I broke
up. Celeste does not know about
that. And we will keep it that
way."|speech
223|SKILLZ|"Didn't know that was a hit and run.
Sounded like you liked her."|speech
224|JESSE|"Well, she's not Celeste. It's
always been Celeste. I'm not ready
to give up."|speech
225|SKILLZ|"Okay, but remember, you can't re-
heat a souffle."|speech
226|JESSE|"Huh?
19."|speech
227|SKILLZ|"Also, there's Bettys everywhere.
It's LA. Maybe it's good to remind
Celeste that you can pull wool.
Make her sweat a little bit."|speech
228|JESSE|"It definitely wouldn't hurt to...go
out with somebody.
They reach the front of the line."|speech
229|YOGURT GIRL|Do you know what you want?|speech
230|JESSE|"Yeah, I want to not be a quitter. I
don't want to start all over again.

I need to say this and then I'll

friends and that's the hard part.
Nothing else matters."|speech
242||Celeste and Beth stand in silence. Then:|stage direction

a car. But...Jesse will always be
my best friend."|speech
244|BETH|"Okay fine. I've said my peace. It's
your life. But I definitely don't

cute! But so young, right?"|speech
287|JESSE|Super young. Her body is all-time.|speech
288|CELESTE|"Okay, no need for that. But this is
good! You gotta crawl before you

it looks best."|speech
302||"She walks over and starts messing with his hair as he
continues."|stage direction

been doing a lot of talking."|speech
310|YOGURT GIRL|"So I was in school but then I
dropped out because I really wanted
to work in fashion but it's really
hard to find a paid internship? So
I went back to school and now I

breakfast, surfs the internet and flips through magazines.
This time, she's also listening to a song from Riley Banks'
new album. It's exactly what she thought it would be.
Overproduced, auto-tuned and meaningless. She nods her head,
""yeah, I get it."" She turns it off.
Celeste can't stop herself from constantly looking over at
the studio to see if Yogurt Girl is still in there. Finally,
a sleeping Jesse stirs for a minute and changes position. He

teenage girls. You go to yoga
