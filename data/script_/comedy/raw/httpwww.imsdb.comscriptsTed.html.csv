been around for three decades. He and John, who sits

worn Red Sox T-shirt he wears. He eats directly from a
box of Fruity Pebbles. Reaching in for a last handful,
he finds the box almost empty. He raises it to empty the
remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours Fruity
Pebbles all over his face. It doesn't faze him much,
