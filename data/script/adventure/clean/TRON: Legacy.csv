Written by
Richard Jefferies
1   INT.   CYBERSPACE
Electric-neon netherworld.     Pulsing chromatics over jet black.
CONSTRUCTION CREW toils to complete a vast SWITCHING NEXUS.
CYPER-TECH CREWMEN and MACHINERY branded ""X-NET"".
3D lattice of routers, refractors, reassemblers... New,
unused data OPTIK HIGHWAY routes radiate from all sides,
crossing cyberspace.
X-Net Tactical Corps troops (herein X-Takks) patrol every
inch.
2   INT.   X-NET NEXUS - UNDER CONSTRUCTION
DATA ""TRAIN"" enters. Sliver of RED DATA ENERGY shunt off,
shooting into RANDOM MEMORY BUFFER - geometrically perfect
lattice of PLASMA BEAMS and WHITE HOT intersection points.
X-Takks notice, moving to investigate.
DEEP IN THE LATTICE:
Red data ""uploads"" into solid form. A RED FIGURE. We see
from the back - infrared strobing DISK, etched metallic
detail, lethal EDGES -
Then slowly he - IT - turns.     Hardly a face, only data-hungry
eyes, riveted to a TASK -
TRON 2.0.
Seriously upgraded, over-clocked, armed for trouble. The
friendly hero we once knew has been re-programmed into a
ruthless cyber-ninja.
X-Takks search ten story gantries.
TRON springs into the lattice, dodging PLASMA BEAMS, avoiding
detection. Slips into:
3   INT.   NEXUS MAIN SHAFT
X-Takks on high alert.
TRON slips down main shaft, freezes, confirms data.       Darts
behind MAIN POWER SUPPLY.
Pulls his DISK.     DISK opens, extends oscillating DATA KEY.

TRON inserts key in and ENCRYPTION PANEL.     Circuits energize.
Shockwave quakes system.
POWER SUPPLY OVERLOADS, SHORTING OUT.
X-Takks spot TRON."|unknown||

POLICE POUNCE, FIRING.
Tron pulls hyper-disk off his back and HURLS IT -
DISK strikes cop, fries his circuits. Disk ricochets,
brutally accurate, takes out three more Police -
TRON flips into the air - His DISK boomerangs straight for
him. Certain death. But his timing is inhumanly accurate.
DISK docks on his back midair, lands and bolts.
ALARMS WAIL -
POWER SUPPLY VERGES on MELTDOWN, CIRCUITS FRY, PLASMA SPEWS.
X-NET CRISIS TEAM rushes in, inserts MASTER KEY. POWER SUPPLY
STABILIZES. Catastrophe averted.
TRON flips away, chased by firing X-Takks -
Arriving on the scene - split-second response:
Elite team of X-NET SECURITY AGENTS, lead by:
RX23 SECURITY LEADER (Cyber-twin of our real-world hero RUSH).
TRON jumps down MAIN SHAFT - a thousand stories. Riding his
DISK as a heat shield dodges X-Net fire, swerves into a DATA
CHANNEL -
RX23 and a pair of his AGENTS hop on PULSE RIDER vehicles,
hotly pursuing TRON.
TRON PLUNGES onto a DATA HIGHWAY - speed out of NEXUS, hurls
across cyberspace.
AGENT 1
This is the first time an Intruder
has broken into X-Net!
RX23 LEADER
And it's the last. Follow him!
Shut him down!
They speed onto the OPTIK HIGHWAY.

4   INT.   X-NET OPTIK HIGHWAY
Broadband, light-speed OPTIK HIGHWAY.     Empty, except for:
TRON - accelerating, escaping.
Rx23 and AGENTS catch up fast on Pulse Rider Vehicles.
TRON throws his disk. Blings off Agents - triggers CRASH.
PLASMA BLAST rips open highway wall.
Rx23 emerges unscathed, pursuing.
5   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - ANCIENT SYSTEM ZONE
TRON leaps out blast hole, recovers his disk, vanishes into
ANCIENT SYSTEM ZONE.
Rx23 roars after him, riding hard, joined by:
Airborne SEARCH ENGINE vehicle, piloted by a dumpy nerd
program called KROD.
KROD
I got a lock. Coordinate 32937!
RX23
I'm on him!
RX23 chases Tron into a dark canyon. Hairpin turns and blind
curves. RX23 arrives a junction. Tron has vanished.
RX23
Which way did he go?!
6   INT.   ENCOM CORPORATION BETA TEST LAB - DAY
Rabbit warren of computer programmers in crisis mode.
A head shoots up from a cubicle. It's Rush Nortebi, 23,
computer security expert. Real world version of the RX23
program. His cubicle is jammed with racks of vintage and
bleeding-edge computer gear.
RUSH
I said WHICH WAY DID HE GO?
Dozens of programmers work feverishly to track the system
intruder. Everybody's stumped. Dangling from desk lamps,
the company toy: Conical pyramid with a square stuck on top,
labeled ""X-NET RULES!""

RUSH
Come on guys! Nobody hacks X-Net.
You gonna let him get away?!
MILES
Rush, I think I found him!
In the adjacent cubicle: Overweight ultra-nerd MILES RABBISH -
real world version of cyberworld Krod.
MILES
Check the old game grid!
Rush jockeys an old Apple LISA computer.     On screen: a crude
old vector graphics game grid.
A RED FIGURE steps appears the grid.
RUSH
You get a cookie, Miles!
Programmers gather to watch Rush in action.
7   EXT.   CYBERSPACE - THE OLD GAME GRID
Vast, low-rez, uncool, largely forgotten.
TRON pulls a LIGHT WAND from his legging, grips it. A TURBO-
CHARGED LIGHT-CYCLE rezzes up beneath him. He fires his
LIGHTCYCLE. ZIP, he's gone.
Onto the grid blasts RX23, speeding on his Pulse rider.    He
skids and swerves, learning the funky surface.
Search Engine flies onto the scene, hovering overhead.
KROD
Coordinate 6532.02!   There he goes!
The chase is on.
TRON escapes across the vast grid-plane, head down, eyes
hollow. He gains speed, retreating to somewhere...
RX23 surges on his Pulse Rider, closing the gap.
8   INT.   REAL WORLD - ENCOM BETA TEST LAB - DAY
Rush gets the hang of this old game.

I haven't played this since I was 4.
