endless savanna from horizon to horizon. We hear savage drums
beating in the distance coming from some unknown place.
The sun clears the horizon. Suddenly it changes amazingly:
the white disc goes through a rapid series of color
transitions, from yellow to green to purple to an incredible
BLOOD RED. From it shoots a RED LIGHTNING BOLT.
The sky echoes with THUNDER.
We hear a HOWLING ethereal wind, but not a twig of the brush
stirs as bolt after bolt of RED LIGHTNING rips the sky, with
each one a TITLE or CREDIT appearing.
Under FINAL CREDIT snow is beginning to fall on the burning
blood-red savanna."|stage direction

a great looking dark-haired girl sitting by herself and
reading a book entitled ""KARATE FOR THE SINGLE GIRL.... A
Guide to Survival In The City."" A few rows forward, near the
open door into the pilots' compartment, is FLASH GORDON.
He's studying a football play-sheet, one of those diagrammed
things with X's and 0's for the players and dotted-line arrows
indicating the directions of movement.
Suddenly the plane makes a violent bump. It almost knocks
the book from DALE'S hand. She looks out the window with
sudden fright, tossing hair out of her eyes, in a gesture
that's habitual to her in moments of stress.
There's nothing to see outside but the pretty clouds. She
looks forward again and watches FLASH standing up easily,
leaning in t..e cockpit doorway to speak to the PILOTS."|stage direction

It is curiously transparent from the inside, mirrored only

punches ZARKOV in the gut. ZARKOV slams him back with the
well-known strength of a madman. FLASH clobbers him again.
Falling, ZARKOV dives sidewards and hits a switch.
The capsule WHINES SOFTLY and begins to WHIRL. Looking out
through the transparent wall, it is as if the capsule itself
was motionless and the scene outside is whirling. What's
left of the greenhouse is under a constant rain of those
LASER BOLTS, flashing fire that makes us dizzy.
FLASH staggers to his feet and finds DALE, folds his arms
around her protectively. The centrifugal force is rapidly
increasing now, throws them both against the wall. Faster
and faster, whirling, the force presses DALE'S body back
against FLASH'S until they are almost one flesh.
We move over and find ZARKOV plastered against another part
of the whirling capsule, his face drained white and distorted
by the terrific G-Force operating here now, his lips moving

Pathetic Earthlings, forever wondering
if you are alone in the universe --
beaming you plaintive messages into
to the void for anything that might
hear you -- even hurling your bodies
out into it -- and all without the
faintest inkling of who or what is
out here. If you had known anything --
anything at all about the true nature
of the universe, you would have hidden
from it, in terror!"|speech

DALE turn their eyes quickly in its direction.
FEATURE PRINCESS AURA
Emerging half into the light beside a column, fondling the
head of an obscure BEAST slouching between her legs.
Voluptuous beyond her years, fiercely erotic, AURA looks
FLASH boldly up and down as the BEAST HISSES with the pleasure
of her touch.
FLASH can't take his eyes off her. No normal man could. FLASH
swallows with a dry throat as AURA'S gaze devours him. DALE
gets the electricity going on, gives him a poke and WHISPERS
LOUDLY."|stage direction

and gazes at her intensely. This guy's personal magnetism
is enormous. As if irresistibly drawn, DALE steps forward.
MING moves his hand in a gesture. A sourceless GOLDEN LIGHT
bathes DALE, sensuous MUSICAL CHORDS are heard. DALE's lips
open slightly, her color heightens, her rate of breathing
increases. MING touches her flesh lightly.
FLASH tense, ready to spring."|stage direction

her moist tongue along the cutting edge of her teeth.

mace.
Unearthly MARTIAL MUSIC comes in a glissando from the
Cavernous space above.
