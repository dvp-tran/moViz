3||"A handful of people are gathered in an open field under a
fierce Mississippi sun. A couple of young inmates, JAKE and
LEON, lean on their shovels. They are waiting to bury two
identical CASKETS with inmate numbers stenciled on the
pinewood lids.
A GUARD rests the butt of his rifle on the ground and takes
a long, healthy pull from his canteen. He offers it to the
PRISON CHAPLAIN, who is much obliged. SUPERINTENDENT BILL
BURKE, a 40-year-old black man, glances at his watch and
loosens his tie. Sure is hot.
MARY HUMPHRIES, an elderly white woman in a nurse's uniform,
stands behind WILLIE LONG, an ancient inmate sleeping
peacefully in a wheelchair. She readjusts an umbrella to
shield the old black man from the blistering sun.
Burke dabs his forehead with a handkerchief. He gives the
nod to the chaplain, who steps forward and cracks his bible.
The men remove their hats."|stage direction

Files."|speech

can't give you anything until you
pay your damn tab."|speech

his head, the barkeep moves on to a paying customer. Ray's
eyes follow a bottle of French Champagne as it is delivered
to a nearby table.
Here sits the straight-laced CLAUDE BANKS with his girlfriend,
DAISY. She's enjoying the show. He's polishing the silverware.
The WAITER pours two glasses of champagne and leaves the
bottle on ice. Claude regards his glass skeptically."|stage direction
53|CLAUDE|"For the kind of money they charge
here, you'd think they could hire
somebody to actually wash the dishes."|speech

at the bank. I always knew you'd
make something of yourself."|speech
55|CLAUDE|"Know what I'm going to buy with my

Get a job, get married, start having
babies. That's what you want, isn't
it?"|speech

reason to rush into things. Damn,
look at this shirt. I'll be right
back."|speech

business."|speech
128|RAY|"Did those two muscle heads shake you
down? Swear I've seen them down at
the track with Sure-shot Riley. That's
it, ain't it? A gambling debt."|speech

his hands and feet. Spanky turns to Ray."|stage direction

Spanky. You already scared him half
to death. He didn't know who he was
fucking with."|speech
169|SPANKY|"But you do. What does that say about
you, Ray? What does that say about
me? I've given you a lot of leeway
over the years on account of your
father. But he didn't last long enough
to teach you the meaning of the word
respect so I guess I'm gonna have to
school you myself."|speech
170|RAY|"Come on, Spank, I'm just trying to
get by here. You remember how it was
when you were starting out."|speech
171||"The henchman yanks on the rope. Claude emerges from the hole,
gasping for breath."|stage direction
172|CLAUDE|"I was supposed to wear this suit on
Monday!"|speech

brew?"|speech

the goods. He's impressed."|stage direction
177|SPANKY|Where'd you get this?|speech

more. A lot more. I was thinking
about going into business for myself,
but under the circumstances, I'd be
willing to take on a partner."|speech

up sucking air desperately. He releases the rope, submerging
Claude for a third time."|stage direction
180|SPANKY|I'm interested. Keep talking.|speech
181|RAY|"All I need is the front money and a
truck. I could be back in two, three
days tops if I had somebody to share
the driving."|speech
182||"Spanky considers the terms. Can he afford to trust Ray? Can
he afford not to?"|stage direction
183|SPANKY|"If you fuck me on this one, I'll
spare no expense."|speech
184|RAY|Understood.|speech
185|SPANKY|"Alright, Ray, you've got a deal.
Pick your man and get going."|speech
186||"Ray glances around. The pulley rope is still twitching in
the water."|stage direction
187|RAY|"I'll take the little choirboy, if
you don't mind."|speech
188|SPANKY|"If I was you, I'd want somebody who
can handle himself in a tight spot."|speech
189|RAY|"I just want somebody who won't put a
bullet in my back once the truck is
full."|speech
190||"Spanky sees Ray's point. He nods to the henchman, who hoists
Claude's limp body out of the water and onto the cement.
Spanky plants a foot on Claude's chest and applies pressure.
A geyser of Harlem River water shoots from Claude's mouth as
he sputters back to life."|stage direction

slap the handcuffs on her and stroll
down the aisle one of these days?"|speech
197||Tight-lipped, Claude shifts in his seat.|stage direction

sheba to settle down with. Suppose
I'm just a tomcat by nature."|speech
199||"(trying to fill the
silence)"|location
200|RAY|"This little rum run is gonna seriously
improve my relationship with Spanky.
He's a good man to have on your side.
He's got the capital and the
connections. That's what you got to
have in that business. Spanky's place
is pretty plush, but one of these
days I'm gonna open up my own
establishment. Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
You like that? Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
That's in the groove, don't you think?"|speech
201||If Claude does like it, he's not letting on.|stage direction
202|RAY|"Come on, daddy-o. You haven't said a
word since we started. Least you
could do is make some friendly
conversation."|speech
203|CLAUDE|"Look, man, I don't want friendly
conversation. I don't want to be
your friend. I've seen your friends
and I don't like them. I just want
to do this thing and get back to New
York in time to start my job."|speech
204|RAY|Start your job? What kind of job?|speech
205|CLAUDE|"Well, if you must know, bank teller
at First Federal of Manhattan. I'm
responsible for keeping track of
hundreds, occasionally thousands of
dollars."|speech

212|RAY|"I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds
like ladies work to me."|speech
213|CLAUDE|"Well, maybe I should dig around in
other people's clothes for money.
It's obviously been highly successful
for you."|speech
214|RAY|"Hey, you'd be surprised what you
find in other people's pockets. Just
gotta avoid them deadbeat bank
tellers. Get you every time."|speech
215|CLAUDE|"I didn't start out to be a bank
teller. I was gonna be a ballplayer.
Even had an offer to play short for
the Newark Eagles."|speech

you have no idea what I'm talking
about."|speech
220|RAY|"You're talking about giving up
baseball to be a bank teller."|speech

plans. Real plans. Not opening some
Zoom-Boom Room. This time next year
I'll be a loan officer."|speech
