1·    EXT. RUSSIA -- NIGHT
We open on a GUARD sitting in front of a sentry post. He is
wearing a heavy fur hat that covers his ears and a military-
jacket. Behind him is a list of instructions (in Russian).
He 'sucks in a cigarette as though he's a drowning man lookin
for oxygen. A CAR comes to a stop by the sentry post, the,
guard looks, asks a couple of questions and is given an"|unknown||

face and a couple of angry words emanate from the back, the
guard jumps back and quickly raises the barrier."|unknown||

and pulls out a transparent plastic bag full of American
dollars. The package is pulled out of the window, the driver
doesn't move, we dissolve for a passage of time, the anxiety
is more than obvious, but Four Fingers can do nothing. All
of a sudden a package comes through the window and the car
speeds off without waiting for an inspection of the delivery.

Franky opens the package and he reveals a stone the size of
a fist. He shines a torch onto it and puts a stone inspectin
monocle to his eye. He's satisfied.

C UT TO:CU OF SPINNING GUN CHAMBER
We are in the back room of an amusement arcade and can hear
fruit machines beeping in the distance. Meet BORIS THE BLADE
and TOMMY who is toying with a heavy-looking revolver.
TOMMY
It's a bit heavy isn't it Boris?
BORIS
Heavy is good. Heavy is reliable.
If it doesn't work you can hit him
with it.
Tommy practices a couple of gun slinging maneuvers. He's
impressed. At that moment the door opens and in walks a MAN
carrying two heavy sacks of coins. He's a rough looking
bastard, he's massive, and extremely ugly. Meet GORGEOUS
GEORGE.
(CONTINUED)

TOMMY
Yes Gorgeous?
George looks at the weapon and can see that he's interrupting.
GORGEOUS GEORGE
Sorry Tommy, I hope that I am not
interrupting.
TOMMY
Oh of course you're not interrupting
Gorgeous, I put the do not disturb
sign on the door because I wanted
you to join us.
George isn't too bright
GORGEOUS GEORGE
What are you doing Tommy?"|unknown||
15||"I am baking a cake Gorgeous, not
that i t ' s any of your business. Put
the takings down, and be a good chap.
-. George puts down the coins. Tommy implies he should leave.
Gorgeous isn't too bright and continues to stand there looking
stupid. Tommy goes to turn around but can see that he hasn't
left, so he turns back,
TOMMY (CONT'D)
Is there anything else Gorgeous, a
cup of tea perhaps? No? Well in
that could you kindly fuck off and
shut the door behind you?
Tommy turns round to Boris with a slight shake of his head.
TOMMY (CONT'D)
Not too bright but he hits like a
train. OK I ' l l take it. You're a
gambling man Boris, so I'll toss you
for it. Heads it's mine, tails I'll
give you twice the price.
Boris chews this for a second.
BORIS

RUSSIAN
Yes he's got it. He might call, he
might not, but if he does be ready.
BORIS
I' l l see what I can do.
RUSSIAN
He can't know that it's you Boris.
We do too much business together.
You're gonna have to get someone
else to hit him and there is no way
it can relate to us. You understand?
BORIS
Yes I understand.
RUSSIAN
One more thing, he loves to gamble.
7   EX.T. BACK ALLEY MAKESHIFT BOXING RING -- DAY
BRICK TOP (aka MR MCLEAN) is a heavy looking fella. He is
observing a giant of a man, BOMBER HARRIS, boxing a sparring
partner.
BRICK TOP
Two hundred and sixty pounds, that's
fucking pedigree pal.
He's talking to LIAM and GARY, a couple of employees.
BRICK TOP (CONT'D)
He doesn't look bad does he?
GARY
Oh no Mr Mclean, he looks great.
LIAM
Yeah great.
GARY
He'll kill him, he'll do you proud
governor.
BRICK TOP
Do you reckon that's what people
should do for me, do you Gary, do me
proud?
GARY
That's what you deserve Mr Mclean.
(CONTINUED)
7   CONTINUED:
BRICK TOP
Pull your tongue out of my arsehoie
Gary. Dogs do that, and you're not
a dog, are you Gary?
Taken aback by the change in tone.
GARY
Err no, I am not.
BRICK TOP
However, you do have all of the
characteristics of a dog Gary, all
except loyalty.
There is a definite change in temperature.
BRICK TOP (CONT'D)
And people like dogs Gary, for the
principal reason that they're loyal.
So I don't quite know where that
leaves you my old son, other than
refuckinpugnant. . .
There is a problem
BRICK TOP (CONT'D)
Which one was it that kept the four
grand from the Clapham job?
Pause
BRICK TOP (CONT'D)
Don't let me ask again. I would
like answers, but I am not in the
mood for asking questions, get busy
lads, or it's feeding time, oink,
oink, know what I mean?
Liam takes a step to the side and moves his eyes in a sideways
action implying the guilt lies with Gary. Gary catches this
and opens his mouth to protest. One of Brick Tops's henchmen,
ERROL, sticks a belt in there as quick as it opens and smashes
a bar across Gary's legs, he buckles. The henchman man pulls
out a plastic bag and a roll of tape.
BRICK TOP (CONT'D')
You know what to do with that don't
you Liam?
CUT TO FIGHTERS. SMALLER FIGHTER IS DISTRACTED.
HARRIS
Don't look for your sake.
(CONTINUED)
7   CONTINUED:   (2)
POV of Smaller Fighter, we witness Liam putting the bag over
Gary's head and tying tape round his neck. Gary tries to
resist but it's futile and we vaguely witness the demise of
poor Gary.
CUT TO BRICK TOP
BRICK TOP
You're a ruthless cunt Liam, I' l l
give you that.
Brick Top turns away at this point to admire his fighter.
BRICK TOP (CONT'D)
But I got no time for grasses.
We cut to see Liam's panic filled eyes. The bar comes down
again. Brick Top finds more interest in his fighter.
BRICK TOP (CONT'D)
Feed em to the pigs Errol.
With a short beat.
BRICK TOP (CONT'D)
He's looking good, Bomber, is he
not? How's their man getting on?
We whip pan off Brick Top's boxing ring...
8   EXT. ANOTHER BACK ALLEY MAKESHIFT BOXING RING - - DAY
...And the whip pan shot takes us into this boxing ring.
Meet TURKISH, he is Tommy's partner. Turkish is older and
wiser than Tommy, they are both watching Gorgeous go through
his paces. Gorgeous George is head butting a heavy punch
bag. The sound that emanates is disturbing, and Tommy is
distracted.
TOMMY
Is he allowed to do that?
Turkish is drinking milk from a bottle
TURKISH
It's an unlicensed boxing match Tommy,
not a tickling competition. These
lads are out to hurt each other.
GORGEOUS GEORGE
Oi Turkish, can I have a drink?
Turkish looks over his shoulder and then points to himself

TURKISH
What do I look like to you George, a
fuckin water boy?
Turkish looks at the WATER BOY.
TURKISH (CONT'D)
Oi son, look lively.
He turns .back to Tommy."|unknown||
16||"Look at it.
He turns to see the remnants of a caravan where they keep
the training gear and administration for the fights
TURKISH (CONT'D)
How am I supposed to run this thing
from that? We gonna need a proper
office.
He looks at the caravan again and sighs, it is quite pitiful
TURKISH (CONT'D)
I want a new one Tommy and you 're
going to buy it for me.
TOMMY
What's wrong with this one?
Turning back to Tommy and ascending the steps in to his ""I
have seen better days"" caravan, TURKISH'S foot goes through
one of the stairs and the.door comes off at the hinges as he
tries to open it.
TURKISH
Oh nothing Tommy, it's tip top, it's
just I am not sure about the colour.
He passes him a piece of paper
TURKISH (CONT'D)
Here it's all arranged. You just
gotta pick it up. Here's an address.
Tommy looks at the address and frowns.
TOMMY
I t ' s that campsite.
TURKISH
That's right, you're buying a caravan,
caravans live in campsites.
(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED:   (2).
TOMMY
They aren't pikey are they?
TURKISH
I don't know what they are, all I
know is they have a caravan, and we
want a Caravan.
TOMMY
I hope they're not pikies.     I hate
fucking pikies.
TURKISH
You're a sensitive boy, ain't you
Tommy? You got ten grand and I want
to see change.
He is distracted by the bulge in Tommy's trouser front.
TURKISH (CONT'D)
Fuck me, hold tight, what's that?
TOMMY
It's my Gucci belt, Turkish.
Pointing quite clearly at the gun.
TURKISH
No Tommy, there's a gun in your
trousers. What is a gun doing in
your trousers?
TOMMY
It's for protection.
TURKISH
Protection from what, the Germans?
The war ended fifty years ago. Err
what's to stop it blowing your balls
off every time you sit down? Where
did you get it?
Looking down onto his gun.
TOMMY
Boris the Blade.
TURKISH
You mean Boris the sneaky fucking
Russian.
Turkish pulls the gun out of Tommy's front.

I t 's because people are scared of

It's because of stories. I am sure
you've heard one or two of those
stories. For example, did you hear
about the three black fellas that
did a very bad thing, however they
made some effort to redeem that very
bad thing, so the governor saw fit
not to kill em. He thought it would
be a more advantageous concept to
let them kill each other and let the
survivor live to tell the tale.
That way everybody wins, well, all
except the two that died of course.
We look at the table where we see three large kitchen knives
sitting provocatively. Tyrone rushes for one of the blades
grabs it and runs at Vin, Vin sidesteps and Tyrone keeps
running straight into the arms of Errol who raises his gun
at the last moment. Tyrone slides the blade into Errol 's
ribs and Errol fires a shot straight at Tyrone. The bullet
passes through Tyrone and hits John in the throat . Vin,
Lincoln and Sol are left wondering what the fuck has just

BTT returns to them - there is a scream from Ken
KEN
You're a dead fuckin man. You listen

Brick top frowns at Ken, and Ken shuts up quickly.
BRICK TOP
What did you do to upset Ken, Tony?
Tony shrugs
KEN
He's pissed in my fuckin pocket,
look!
Ken shows off a wet-sided jacket and a damp set of trousers.
BRICK TOP
Do shut up Ken.   That was a bit
naughty Tony.
Tony shrugs. Brick Top puts his hands in to his pocket and
withdraws the stone. We cut to Hand's expression.
HANDS
Well come on, let's have a look.
Brick Top passes the stone to Hands. All goes quiet while
everybody focuses on the stone. Hands lifts it up to his
eye.
HANDS (CONT'D)
What are you playing at? -
He drops the stone: it smashes on the ground.
HANDS (CONT'D)
It's a zirconia.

A distant voice is shouting
TURKISH

117 ' INT. VAN -- NIGHT
We fade out of black to Micky's pov. Thisis shot in slow
motion. Micky opens his eyes, in the backof.a large van,
there is only one faint light that moodilyilluminates his
tired eyes.
TURKISH
You feeling alright Micky?
MICKY
I've felt better.
TURKISH

A temporary ring has   been erected, four scaffolding posts
with welded on hoops   make the arena, the ropes that are
threaded through the   hoops are industrial nylon and free of
padding. Around the    ropes it's starting to fill. Brick Top
approaches Salt Pete   and Jack 'the all seeing eye'.
SALT, PETER

BRICK TOP
This will make up for it.     Micky's

120   INT. WAREHOUSE
Micky appears from a small door at the back of the warehouse.
He approaches the ring accompanied with shouts of
encouragement and counter shouts. He's wearing a pair of
semi cut tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt with grease marks
down the front. Turkish walks behind him, Micky still looks
bored. He climbs into the ring. Then from the same door as
the one through Micky came out walks a larger character with
a nose that appears to have seen countless rounds with a
frying pan: HORACE 'GOOD NIGHT1 ANDERSON.
THE REFF
Alright lads no eye gouging no biting.
Do your worst. Back to your corners.
We drift again into Micky's pov, his world is becoming more
and more surreal. He can faintly hear Turkish whispering
words to him, but he's not really listening. A bell comes
from somewhere, and Micky instinctively walks to the center
of the ring. ""Good night"" is already there, they pace one
another for a second or two, Micky avoids a punch or two and
then he takes a hard one and he knows it, we flash to white,
Micky's in trouble: he lets one of his missiles go and BANG
it shakes ""good night"" to his core, all goes quiet. We go
to super slow motion: his knees buckle and ""good night"" is
in trouble. Micky maintains a frown as he watches his
opponent's knees threaten to betray him. The crowd tries to
digest what is happening. After a period of silence reality
dawns. Brick Top mouths the words in silence.""Don1t go down
you fucker"". The crowd wants Micky to finish the job. But
common sense reins back the coup de grace. ""Good night""
eventually regains control of his legs and stumbles forward,
after a few sleepy punches he starts to provide a serious
onslaught.
TURKISH
I don't like the look of this Tommy,
bring the van up to the back door.
This goes on for two rounds (which is montage down to a few
seconds). We go in the mind of poor Micky. We break the
music just as it's starting to look dangerous... The bell
goes and Micky walks to the wrong corner. Turkish pulls him
back to his corner.
TURKISH (CONT'D)"|unknown||
1254||"They are on ya. You got to hurt him
Micky. Otherwise we are
rumbled.... you hear me Micky? Do
-something, it looks like it' s rigged."|location||
1255||"Micky goes out again his hands are low, BANG there is a flash
of white as Micky goes down in the dirt. Dust rises from
where he fell. He gets up quickly, his hands are still low,
BANG he goes down again, in no time he's up.
(CONTINUED)
120   CONTINUED:    -
BANG: he hits the ground again and this time when he hits
the deck, he penetrates the dust covered floor, like i t ' s
made out of water. He falls through the water like he's
sinking; his eyes are open and he can't breathe, he continues
to fall, but he's unpanicked (he is now Micky 1). When Micky
1 looks up he can see himself in the corner of the ring takin
kidney punches from Good Night, he's winded and only semi-
conscious (this is Micky 2). Micky 1 makes the effort to
swim up and tries to penetrate the floor but he's stuck he
can't get through. Micky 2 takes more punishment in the
ring, as Micky 1 ' s hand continues to try to break the
underside of the floor but it stretches like rubber and forces
Micky 1 down again. Micky 1 looks up again and sees how
much trouble Micky 2 ' s in the ring. Micky 1 is panicking
now, he's running out of oxygen and Micky 2's being beaten,
Micky 1 starts -to sink again but now flames tickle the bottom
of his feet he looks up. and sees Micky 2 being smashed to
hell, his body eventually collapses and Micky 2 falls through
the floor. And as the latter falls through, Micky 1 manages
to rise from the depths and his punch manages to perforate
the surface. The punch continues its trajectory and has the
power to fell a red blooded rhino.... it catches ""Good Night""
on the jaw and it's good night for ""Good Night"" it's unlikely
that he'll awake in the next hour. Dear oh dear everybody
is in trouble.
Again we cut to the reactions of the relevant parties.
TURKISH (CONT'D)
Tommy get the van.
TOMMY
I have it, it's waiting.
Turkish jumps into the ring and grabs Micky.
TURKISH
We are off Micky, hold tight, and
move quickly. ,
Turkish pulls Micky away. It's not as hard as it might be
trying to get out, because the crowd seems to have found its
own disputes, chairs start to fly. Brick Top's boys are
frustrated in the mayhem. Brick Top calmly dials into his
mobile telephone. It rings.

We pull back to see four slumped heads in the car and blood
staining the windscreen. Brick Top calmly puts the phone
down.
BRICK TOP
Right lets get outta here.
Brick Top is looking every which way and trying to get out
of there, accompanied by Ken.
BRICK TOP (CONT.'D)
Where's the car Ken?
KEN
I t ' s coming now.
BRICK TOP
We are outta here.
They come out of a side entrance, their car pulls round the
corner and screeches to a halt. Brick Top opens the door as
he is about to get in, he's eyes widen to the size of saucers
as FOUR MEN (who we recognize from the wake) are sitting in
the place of his driver. They both have sawed-off shotguns
and empty four barrels into the chest of Brick Top and Ken.
The car spins away, leaving their twitching bodies on the
dirt.

Cut to Tony having some problems trying to get hold of the
awkward dog. The dog starts to squeak. Tony passes the
blade to Hands.
BTT
I t ' s squeaking.
HANDS
What, you've never heard a dog squeak
before?... Hold him still.
The dog isn't sure about this either.      Vin is in a panic and
suddenly.
VINNY
Stop! I can see it.   I can see the
stone.
Hands at the point of entry stops. Vinny hops over to the
stone and picks it up. Tony lets the dog stand but keeps a
grip oh the collar. The dog is relieved to be semi-liberated.
Hands is still on his knees armed with an incredulous stare.
HANDS
Well let's see it.
Vinny holds it up. There's a sense of relief. He then throws
the stone, it cuts through the air. And the dog seeing
.another projectile runs to intercept it. There's a pause
while all now focus again on the dog. This is digested
literally and mentally. The dog recognizes all the attention
it's receiving. And goes through the motions of swallowing
it. Hands attempts an approach. The dog understandably
feels uncomfortable about the advancing vanguard and decides
emergency action is needed, and seeing the open window
launches itself out of it.
