Lyrics by Josh Heald
Music by Def Leppard, Styx, Journey, Poison, or Whitesnake
Water cranked to a hundred and three
Got my tunes, my snacks, my booze, my skis
(Got the) freshest moves you ever seen
When I'm soakin in my Hot Tub Time Machine
When you're going back to the 80s...
And you might be fuckin some ladies...
You bring your button fly jeans and some sweet hair gel
Want blow? All you gotta do is yell
(Yeah you're) lookin real smooth, (and you're) lookin real mean
When you're soakin in your Hot Tub Time Machine
Yeah!
Hot Tub - Time Machine!
Hot Tub - Time Machine!
C'mon!"|speech|unknown|?|
