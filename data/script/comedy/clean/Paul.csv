dog and a young girl emerge."|speech|unknown|?

The dog trots out across the property. It stops to scratch.
The sounds of night cease. The dog stops scratching, sniffing
the air, cocking its head, sensing something. We hear a low
humming sounds. The dog looks up. We see a soft orange glow
reflected in its eyes. The dog whimpers
Back at the farmhouse, a deep, dull thud shakes the ground,
bringing the small girl back out onto the veranda. An orange
glow pulsates somewhere out in the darkness."|speech|GIRL|M

a long black leather coat, Red Dwarf T-shirt and boots. His
hair is densely curly and shaped like a pyramid.
Four people dressed as BORG from Star Trek pass by. GRAHAM

234|GRAHAM|"Yes, imagine if we got buzzed up by
a craft."|speech|GRAHAM|M

whoever it was turned doff."|speech|GRAHAM|M
246|CLIVE|"Of course it's them. We're dead.
It's like Deliverance. They're
going to rape us and break our
arms."|speech|CLIVE|M

250|CLIVE|"I'm gonna have to fly blind.

CLIVE kills the headlights. They are plunged into darkness,
still travelling at 65mph. The headlights come back on."|speech|CLIVE|M
251|CLIVE|"Probably best not to do that. I
couldn't really see anything.
They stare at the monitor. Suddenly, creeping up the rear of
the RV, headlights. The front of a car becomes visible."|speech|CLIVE|M
252|CLIVE|Oh God, oh God, oh God.|speech|CLIVE|M
253|GRAHAM|I need the toilet.|speech|GRAHAM|M

257|CLIVE|Should I ram them?|speech|CLIVE|M
258|GRAHAM|"What about the deposit?
CLIVE gingerly jerks the wheel, causing the RV to swerve. A
BLACK SEDAN car appears next to them, manoeuvering wildly to
avoid the RV. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare in horror, their eyes
widen as the car flips over and tumbles several times,
bouncing across the asphalt and sliding to a smoking stop on
its roof. GRAHAM's mouth hangs open. CLIVE blinks."|speech|GRAHAM|M
259|CLIVE|"It wasn't them.
The RV pulls up to the crashed vehicle and stops. GRAHAM and
CLIVE peer out of the window."|speech|CLIVE|M

They wait for a few seconds. Nothing."|speech|CLIVE|M
267|GRAHAM|"Maybe you should call for help.
GRAHAM pulls out a cell phone and starts to dial.
VOICE (O.S.)
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
GRAHAM and CLIVE spin round to see an indistinct figure
sitting on a rock in the nearby darkness. The glow of a
cigarette briefly lights up what appear to be two large,
black eyes. GRAHAM and CLIVE gawp."|speech|GRAHAM|M

Graham, give me the phone.
GRAHAM passes the phone over."|speech|CLIVE|M

your call? Hello? Hello?

of them, clad only in cut-off short and flip-flops... is an
ALIEN."|speech|OPERATOR|M
271|ALIEN|"Put - the phone - down.
Without the slightest change of expression CLIVE rocks
backwards in a dead faint. He hits the ground with a bump.
GRAHAM looks at CLIVE then back at the ALIEN. When GRAHAM
speaks his voice quivers with hysterical panic."|speech|ALIEN|M

do people always assume we want to
stick something up their ass?"|speech|ALIEN|M
280|GRAHAM|Don't you?|speech|GRAHAM|M
281|ALIEN|"No. There's certainly nothing about
it in the encounter manual. As a
rule, we don't even abduct. Maybe
people find it easier to deal with
earthly transgressions if they
suppress it with absurd fantasies
about alien probing."|speech|ALIEN|M
282|GRAHAM|What?|speech|GRAHAM|M
283|ALIEN|"It's just a theory. Listen, focus

clasp together, pleading."|speech|GRAHAMBUT-ALIEN|?

starts up and drives off.

of humanity. Faith is a night-
light. It illuminates the scary
corners, fills the gaps, makes the
universe easier to comprehend.
Thing is, it's okay not to know
everything. I mean, who knows
what's really out there? Did you

that's how the universe came to be?
