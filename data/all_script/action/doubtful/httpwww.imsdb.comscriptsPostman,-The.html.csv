FADE IN:
1   EXT. DESERT LANDSCAPE (UTAH) - DAY                            1
Jagged mountains defy a dark, foreboding sky. We hear
PLODDING HOOVES, CREAKING LEATHER. A lone wanderer
appears. Wearing a long coat and a battered hat, he
carries a bolt-action carbine. His name forgotten,
history remembers him simply as THE POSTMAN.
His laden pack mule, BILL, BRAYS, as they pass a battered
sign: ""The Great Salt Lake Marina."" They start down a
slope and begin to cross a...
DRY LAKE BED
A bizarre, wind-swept sight. Dozens of boats resting lee-
to on the dry, cracked earth. It's like God pulled the
plug. Rusty mooring chains snake their way around house
boats, ski boats and a cabin cruiser or two.
WOMAN (V.O.)
The last of the great cities died
when my father was a child.
Another victim of yet another war.
The plagues followed. And the
terrors. The living hid
themselves away in tiny hamlets in
hopes of surviving whatever new
madness conspired to rob them of
the little that remained. The
Earth itself had fallen prey to
chaos. For three years a dirty
snow fell that even summer could
not erase. The ocean was barren.
Poisoned. Near death.
As The Postman continues to cross, the CAMERA PULLS BACK.
He's soon lost in the massive vista.
WOMAN (V.O.)
Sixteen long years passed before
the great lungs started working
again. My father said it was as
if the ocean breathed a great sigh
of relief...
A RUMBLE of THUNDER. RAIN begins to fall. The earth just
sucks it up at first, but it's coming hard. Rivulets run.
Puddles form. We begin to get the feeling that soon these
boats will be tugging at the mooring chains once again.

TRACK a rivulet as it runs, filling up a depression in the
sand. And then, running to fill another in a series of
depressions. They make a pattern we recognize as --
MAN'S FOOTPRINTS
These tracks may already be days old as they fill with
rain water. Then, the sound of light, padded FOOTFALLS.
A LION ENTERS FRAME. Lean, hungry and dangerous, the big
cat has been tracking this man. He lets out a low,
disappointed GROWL. The rain has foiled his dinner
plans -- for now.
2   EXT. HIGHWAY ON-RAMP (UTAH) - DAY                            2
A bullet-ridden sign reads: ""U.S. 84 North."" The Postman
leads Bill down a barren 4-lane. Weeds poke up through
the asphalt. The rusting hulk of a car rests in the
median, covered in a tangle of purple wisteria. The
Postman plucks a flower. He sticks it into a buttonhole
and continues.
BILL BRAYS woefully.    In answer:
THE POSTMAN
I don't know. And if you ask me
again, I'm going to slug you.
They near a sign: ""Thank You For Visiting Utah."" The
Postman waves, shouts to the sign as he passes it.
THE POSTMAN
It's been fun, hasn't it, kids?
(to the sign)
You're welcome!
3   EXT. 4-LANE (IDAHO) - BILLBOARD - DAY                        3
Bill tugs up weeds as The Postman is climbing up a ladder
on a highway that razor cuts the plains to the horizon.
Above, The Postman sands atop a billboard catwalk. He
references a tattered road atlas, scans the horizon
through binoculars with one broken lens. He pauses at a
Union 76 ball just visible above the tree line.
4.
4   EXT. HIGHWAY TRAVEL STOP (IDAHO) - DAY                        4
A 76 Station and the remains of a Howard Johnson's.
Alert, carbine in hand, The Postman leads in the mule.
Rusting cars sag on flattened tires. There's a stripped
fire engine, its cracked hoses leading to the HoJo
foundation which bristles with burned timbers.
Bill stops to drink out of a stream.   The Postman swats at
him with his hat.
THE POSTMAN
Damnit, Bill, you know I need to
check it first!
Bill hangs his head. The Postman digs through his pack.
He removes an old Tupperware container and replaces its
contents -- a tiny sheaf of litmus papers and several
small bottles -- with stream water. He adds a few drops
from each bottle. Swirls it around. Then dips a tiny
strip of paper into the water. The paper turns a vivid
purple. The Postman is dubious.
THE POSTMAN
Better than turpentine.
(touches some
to his lips)
Tastes about the same. Your call,
Bill.
Bill drinks.
THE POSTMAN
You ain't picky, Bill. I like
that about you.
The Postman takes his carbine and a burlap sack and
crosses to the 76 Station. An old extension ladder on the
ground. The pole holding up the 76 ball has a 30-degree
bend in it, like someone once tried to pull it over.
Beyond the 76 ball, the sun sets -- but we here in the
20th Century have never seen such a wild riot of color
before.
The Postman tries the station door. Locked. Smiling
ironically, he steps in through the blown-out window.
5   INT. 76 STATION - OFFICE - DAY                                5
A shambles. The Postman kicks around the table. He finds
a few beat-up CDs, flips through them. Reads the label.

THE POSTMAN
'Running on Empty'? Tell me about
it.
Tossing it, he turns, stops. There, resting on a pile of
trash is a bashed-in portable TV. The Postman smiles."|unknown
4||"Hey, Bill! We got TV! 147
channels. Everything from Jesus
to 'Jeopardy'.
He steps over, switches on the set.      Nothing happens, but
The Postman pretends just the same.      He mimics static,
then:
THE POSTMAN
'Like sands through the hour-
glass, so are the days of our
lives...'
(switching channels)
'Michael Shields, come on down,
you're the next contestant
on...'The Price is Right'.'
(switching again)
I'll take Domestic Nuclear
Disasters for two hundred
thousand, Alex...
The Postman stops suddenly.    Click.
THE POSTMAN
We interrupt our regularly
scheduled program to bring you the
Second Civil War... Well, shit.
The Postman stares at the blank screen a moment. There's
a sudden, panicked RUSTLING from behind the service
manager's desk. The Postman wheels around, raises the
carbine.
THE POSTMAN
I don't want any trouble... I bet
you don't either... Let's just
call it a draw, okay?
Sudden MOVEMENT. The Postman shouts in surprise as a Doe
dashes out from behind the desk. Scared, it bounds back
and forth between the walls. Then freezes in the corner.
The Postman sighs in relief, lowers the carbine.
THE POSTMAN
Look out, Bill!

The doe bolts for the window and runs right into Bill.
Bill has a conniption fit.
Investigating further, The Postman spots a cigarette
machine. The front glass is smashed and all the slots are
empty. But he looks down to the lock at the bottom. It's
intact. He pulls a crowbar from the sack, crouches by the
machine and digs the pry into a seam and pulls.
The panel bursts open to reveal four half-open cartons of
cigarettes. He doesn't believe it for a second. Then:
THE POSTMAN
I'm rich.
6   EXT. 76 STATION - NIGHT                                         6
Embers of a campfire glow.    The Postman is asleep, the
carbine in reach.
BILL BRAYS and nervously stamps his hooves. The Postman
reaches for the carbine only to find the barrel of a
shotgun pointed in his face.
Three BANDITS! Hard-eyed and ugly. One, barely 20, is
mostly just ugly. The Postman looks down the barrels of a
shotgun, a rifle and a revolver. The LEAD BANDIT kicks
the carbine out of reach.
THE POSTMAN
I'm just passing through. I don't
mean anyone any harm.
(re: stream)
Water's good.
The Lead Bandit pokes at The Postman's shoulder with the
muzzle of his rifle. The Postman knows why.
THE POSTMAN
I'm not a Holnist.
The Lead Bandit pokes again. Harder. The Postman opens
his shirt, reveals his bare left shoulder.
THE POSTMAN
Okay?
They just stare at him, none saying a word.      Creepy.
THE POSTMAN
I'm headed for a town called St.
Rose. Somewhere west of Portland.

LEAD BANDIT
Portland's under twenty feet of
water.
THE POSTMAN
Well, I heard different.
LEAD BANDIT
You mouthin' me?
THE POSTMAN
No, it's just that it's hard to
get good information.
The third BANDIT, a HULKING brute, has been quiet.
HULKING BANDIT
He is mouthin' you; I say we kill
him.
LEAD BANDIT
Don't be in such a rush, Martin.
(back to
The Postman)
Now I see a pack mule over there,
but I don't see no packs.
THE POSTMAN
This is all I got.
LEAD BANDIT
Oh... Kill him, Martin.
The Hulking Bandit, raises his shotgun. The butt end.
He's going to bludgeon The Postman to death."|unknown
5||"(pointing)
Okay!   My stuff's up there!
The 76 ball is twenty feet above the ground. In the gloom
you can just see a hole has been punched through the side.
BANDIT #20
What do you got in there?
The Lead Bandit swats Bandit #20 upside the head.
LEAD BANDIT
Shut up.
(to Postman)
What do you got in there?

Cigarettes."|unknown
7||Cigarettes!|unknown
8||"Sure.   There's the ladder.
BANDIT #20
Maybe he's got it booby-trapped.
The Lead Bandit is about to smack Bandit #20 again -- then
he sees the logic out of it. The Postman shakes his head,
but isn't that convincing.
LEAD BANDIT
You go up and get it.
CUT TO:
7   EXT. 76 BALL - DAWN                                             7
The ladder set against the bent pole. Prodded by a
shotgun, The Postman climbs, disappears through the hole
and into the tilting 76 ball.
8   INT. 76 BALL - DAWN                                             8
Full of The Postman's earthly possessions. Trick is, how
to save them and his life at the same time. He spies an
old wrench: remnant of an attempt to remove the rusty
bolts holding the ball in place. An idea begins to take
shape.
LEAD BANDIT (O.S.)
Just you start tossing those
cigarettes down!
BANDITS
There's no answer.     The Bandits eye each other nervously.
BANDIT #20
Maybe he fell asleep.

76 BALL
The Postman grabs the wrench, starts working one of the
last two rusted bolts. As it starts to give...
THE POSTMAN
It's going to take a second.    I
got my stuff bolted in.
BANDITS
The Lead Bandit takes a cautious step back.
LEAD BANDIT
Put some buckshot through it,
Martin. Just to hurry him up.
HULKING BANDIT
I only got three shells left.
LEAD BANDIT
So use his gun.
The Hulking Bandit picks up the carbine and aims. CLICK.
It isn't loaded. The Hulking Bandit tosses the gun aside,
pulls a knife from his boot. Grimly, he begins to climb.
76 BALL
Cramped, The Postman's busy at the base of the ball,
trying to unscrew the last remaining bolt. It won't
budge.
LADDER
The Hulking Bandit has only a few more rungs to go.
76 BALL
No good.   Time's up.   The Postman starts rocking the pole.
LADDER
The Hulking Bandit has reached the opening -- feels the
rocking motion. Hangs on.

76 BALL
Knife in hand, the Hulking Bandit looks inside. At that
instant, The Postman rocks the pole one more time. The
rusty bolt is not enough to keep the ball's full weight in
place. It pops. The ball is frozen for an instant before
going with the pole's tilt.
LADDER
The 76 ball drops off the pole, rolling over the Hulking
Bandit's back and down the ladder's incline. The other
Bandits dive clear as the 76 ball hurtles past.
THE POSTMAN
whips head over heels as the ball speeds away.
FIELD
The 76 ball launches off a dirt berm, but soon comes to a
stop as it slams into an old utility pole and bursts
apart. Fighting the vertigo, The Postman staggers to his
feet.
THE POSTMAN
Bill!
Bill bolts from the station as the Lead Bandit raises the
RIFLE and FIRES at The Postman.
Losing balance, The Postman lands on his butt just before
a bullet splinters the utility pole above his head.
Wobbly, he tries to gather his packs. The Bandits charge,
quickly closing the ground, but Bill is there first.
Holding as much as he can, The Postman heaves himself over
Bill's back. As the mule gallops away, the Lead Bandit
aims the rifle. He's got The Postman in his sights.
He's about to fire when -- Bandit #20 stands up INTO the
SHOT. He's got a fistful of cigarettes in each hand and
he's laughing like a hyena!
BANDIT #20
We're rich!

The soldiers pick up their guns and that's when they see
The Postman.
THE POSTMAN
Riding over the crest. Galloping toward them. Behind
him, forty new mail carriers. All riding like mad. One
of them carries the flag of the restored United States.
Gibbs and his men run for their horses. SHOTS are FIRED.
Four Holnists go down. The rest gallop away.
The Postman and his carriers meet."|location

... We were outnumbered, sir.
BETHLEHEM
How many?
GIBBS
A least a hundred. With guns.

With guns? Are you sure?
GIBBS
Yes, sir...

Bethlehem reaches for his sword.    But before it clears the

The horses collide.    Bethlehem and The Postman hit the
ground hard.
Holnists and Carriers alike begin to move forward for a
better look.
The fight is fierce. Bloody. The Postman and Bethlehem
are at each other like coiled snakes.
It's more of a fight than any of the Holnists --
especially Getty -- expected. The spectators pull in
tighter.
Both combatants have taken a beating -- and still, they
fight on -- trading bloody, raw-knuckled punches.
One of Bethlehem's connects. The Postman loses his
footing, hits the ground -- knocking his head on a rock
with a resounding CRACK. Dazed, he's slow to rise.
It's just the moment Bethlehem needs, he straddles the
fallen Postman, reaches for his knife with one hand --
grabs The Postman's throat with the other."|location
