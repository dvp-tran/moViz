pounding its way through the orange haze of smog. As we
descend toward the clots of traffic blocking the streets:
the sounds of a Mass being sung.
A CATHOLIC CHURCH
The big wooden doors open to release the parishioners
inside. Feature a tall, lanky 18-YEAR-OLD. Holding his
GIRLFRIEND'S hand, anxious for Sunday to really begin.
They don't notice the traffic suddenly thin, like a
faucet's been cranked down. They move toward a Mercedes
500. As a CHAUFFEUR holds the back door open for them...
A GRAND MARQUIS
Squeals around the corner, lurches to a stop alongside
the Mercedes. FOUR MEN get out flashing  badges. In a
moment they're hustling Eighteen toward the car, stiff-
arming the chauffeur. As the girlfriend  cries and the
gossip among the parishioners begins...
The Grand Marquis pulls away."|stage direction

These guys are not the police.
A switchblade is flicked open. Practiced hands slit the
boy's Sunday suit from the base of his neck to his heels.
Eighteen yelps as the blade draws blood across one calf.
Duct tape is wrapped around his hands, eyes, and head."|stage direction

11||"The Marquis is parked across from another CAR. FOUR NEW

15||"A wall smeared with God-knows-what. Facing   it, Eighteen
stands naked blindfolded and shivering. The   back of his
leg still bleeds. He shifts nervously as a   little JACK
RUSSELL TERRIER eagerly licks the blood off  his calf.
A MAN ('The Dreamer'), we don't see his face, negotiates
by cell phone. Voice calm. As he runs numbers, he slaps
his thigh. Jack Russell trots over, gets an ear
scratched.
At a motion from the man, Eighteen is taken down to the
ground. Straddled by two men, his head is mummified in
tape leaving one ear exposed.

train flashes beneath. Car headlights illuminate the
bridge.
Time stands still and the 'city sounds' fade out to
nothing.
She runs up the remaining stairs and sprints across the
bridge. Her hood blows off revealing her full face.
It's definitely Pinta. Camera ramps as he jumps into
Creasy's arms. This is not the little girl we
experienced in the beginning of the movie. The
experience she just endured has been life changing. All
of a sudden we have a 40 year old head on an 8 year old
body.
She wraps herself around him. He picks her up.     We
glimpse a simple tear on his cheek. They talk.     But we
do not hear the words.

not coming back. We're shooting through the glass of the

He is clearly on a mission. He strides through the

the other.
