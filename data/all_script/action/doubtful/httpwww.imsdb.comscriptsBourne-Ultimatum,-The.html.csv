don't know. I just know my

Bourne is a serious threat until

meeting Pierre Elattrache on

him who started Treadstone.
That's a big problem, wouldn't
you agree?

This doesn't feel like Bourne to
me.

Why's it so hard for you to
believe?
LANDY
Probably because it's coming from
you, Noah.
VOSEN
Lets try and be adults okay? We
all thought he was done, off the
grid. But Bourne's back. Maybe
he's a threat. We both want the
same thing here.

REVEAL Paz, his SUV racing along the curb lane. As
Bourne's car crosses in front of a small car stopped at the
intersection Paz swerves his car into that car and punches
it into the side of Bourne's car.
Bourne's car is knocked spinning, Paz keeps charging

Paz gains on him and Bourne is forced to swerve violently
to deny Paz the kill shot he is all too capable of.
Just ahead of Bourne, two government SUVs slide into the
intersection completely blocking his path.
Bourne instantly spins his car 180 degrees and continues
on, barreling into the roadblock backwards.
As Bourne's car plows through the SUV's he whips the wheel
and his car spins through a reverse 180 as Paz and the
other sedan race through the wreckage in Bourne's wake.

(call sign Alpha-2503) racing toward the intersection just
ahead.
Bourne slows, then speeds up quickly to time it right:
The CRI car almost hits his bumper, then has to accelerate
through the upcoming intersection. As he does, the cop car
Bourne was listening to on the radio slams broadside into
the CRI sedan drafting the bumper of the mangled cop car.
Swerving wildly Paz avoids the pileup and slams his heavy
SUV into the back of Bourne's car, pushing him into the
oncoming traffic.
Several cars swerve left and right as Paz pushes Bourne
sideways onto the ramped end of a K-Rail dividing the
street ahead.
The nearly upended car grinds down the K-Rail until the
rear of Bourne's car strikes an obstruction which punches
it back into the lane as it slams against the front of
Paz's SUV, knocking the SUV sideways, into a row of parked

You're not a liar are you? Or too
weak to see this through? This is
it. Let go of David Webb. Will
you give yourself to this
program?

Bourne looks down, a gun in his hand. He gets to his feet
swiftly and fires the pistol several times into a hooded
figure. The man slumps over.
Bourne stares at what he's done.
HIRSCH (CONT'D)
You're no longer David Webb.
From now on you'll be known as
Jason Bourne. Welcome to the
program.
Daniels pulls the hood off the figure to show that he is
dead.
Just then Kramer walks through the door.
KRAMER
He's ready. Send him to
Operations."|unknown

He stares back at Hirsch....
HIRSCH
Do you remember now?
Bourne lowers the gun.
BOURNE
I remember. I remember
everything.
HIRSCH
You can't outrun what you did,
Jason. You made yourself into
who you are.
BOURNE
I'm done running.  That's why
I'm here. To end you, to shut
this down. I'm no longer Jason
Bourne.
HIRSCH
So now you're going to kill me?
BOURNE
No. You don't deserve the star
they give you on the wall at
Langley.
Just then Bourne spins -- agents arrive at the door.    It's
locked.
