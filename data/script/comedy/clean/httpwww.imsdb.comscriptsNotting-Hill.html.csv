bachelor flat.
Spike appears.  An unusual looking fellow.  He has unusual
hair, unusual facial hair and an unusual Welsh accent: very
white, as though his flesh has never seen the sun.  He wears
only shorts."|stage direction||
31|SPIKE|"Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me
with an incredibly important
decision, could you?"|speech|SPIKE|M

let's say, whether they should
cancel third world debt?"|speech|WILLIAM|M

on a date with the great Janine and I
just want to be sure I've picked the

55|WILLIAM (V.O.)|"And so it was just another hopeless
Wednesday, as I set off through the
market to work, little suspecting
that this was the day which would
change my life forever.  This is
work, by the way, my little travel
book shop..."|speech|WILLIAM|M
56||A small unpretentious store... named 'The Travel Book Co.'|stage direction||
57|WILLIAM (V.O.)|"... which, well, sells travel books

always sell many of those."|speech|WILLIAM|M
58||William enters.|stage direction||
59||INT. THE BOOKSHOP - DAY|location||
60||"It is a small shop, slightly chaotic, bookshelves everywhere,
with little secret bits round corners with even more books.
Martin, William's sole employee, is waiting enthusiastically.
He is very keen, an uncrushable optimist.  Perhaps without
cause.  A few seconds later, William stands gloomily behind the
desk."|stage direction||
61|WILLIAM|"Classic.  Absolutely classic.
Profit from major sales push -- minus
$B!r(J347."|speech|WILLIAM|M

pain."|speech|MARTIN|M
63|WILLIAM|"Yes, better get me a half.  All I can
afford."|speech|WILLIAM|M

65||"He salutes and bolts out the door -- as he does, a woman walks in.
We only just glimpse her.
Cut to William working.  He looks up casually.  And sees
something.  His reaction is hard to read.  After a pause..."|stage direction||
66|WILLIAM|Can I help you?|speech|WILLIAM|M
67||"It is Anna Scott, the biggest movie star in the world -- here --
in his shop.  The most divine, subtle, beautiful woman on earth.
When she speaks she is very self-assured and self-contained."|stage direction||
68|ANNA|No, thanks.  I'll just look around.|speech|ANNA|F
69|WILLIAM|Fine.|speech|WILLIAM|M
70||"She wanders over to a shelf as he watches her -- and picks out a
quite smart coffee table book."|stage direction||
71|WILLIAM|"That book's really not good -- just
in case, you know, browsing turned to
buying.  You'd be wasting your money."|speech|WILLIAM|M
72|ANNA|Really?|speech|ANNA|F
73|WILLIAM|"Yes.  This one though is... very
good."|speech|WILLIAM|M
74||He picks up a book on the counter.|stage direction||
75|WILLIAM|"I think the man who wrote it has
actually been to Turkey, which helps.
There's also a very amusing incident
with a kebab."|speech|WILLIAM|M
76|ANNA|Thanks.  I'll think about it.|speech|ANNA|F
77||"William suddenly spies something odd on the small TV monitor
beside him."|stage direction||
78|WILLIAM|If you could just give me a second.|speech|WILLIAM|M
79||"Her eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and
approaches a man in slightly ill-fitting clothes."|stage direction||

81|THIEF|Yes.|speech|THIEF|M
82|WILLIAM|Bad news.|speech|WILLIAM|M
83|THIEF|What?|speech|THIEF|M
84|WILLIAM|"We've got a security camera in this
bit of the shop."|speech|WILLIAM|M
85|THIEF|So?|speech|THIEF|M
86|WILLIAM|"So, I saw you put that book down your
trousers."|speech|WILLIAM|M
87|THIEF|What book?|speech|THIEF|M
88|WILLIAM|The one down your trousers.|speech|WILLIAM|M
89|THIEF|I haven't got a book down my trousers.|speech|THIEF|M
90|WILLIAM|"Right -- well, then we have something
of an impasse.  I tell you what --
I'll call the police -- and,  what can
I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole
book-down-the-trousers scenario, I
really apologize."|speech|WILLIAM|M
91|THIEF|"Okay -- what if I did have a book down
my trousers?"|speech|THIEF|M
92|WILLIAM|"Well, ideally, when I went back to
the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan
guide to Bali from your trousers, and
either wipe it and put it back, or
buy it.  See you in a sec."|speech|WILLIAM|M
93||"He returns to his desk.  In the monitor we just glimpse, as does
William, the book coming out of the trousers and put back on the
shelves.  The thief drifts out towards the door.  Anna, who has
observed all this, is looking at a blue book on the counter."|stage direction||
94|WILLIAM|Sorry about that...|speech|WILLIAM|M
95|ANNA|"No, that's fine.  I was going to
steal one myself but now I've changed
my mind.  Signed by the author, I see."|speech|ANNA|F
96|WILLIAM|"Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you
can find an unsigned copy, it's
worth an absolute fortune."|speech|WILLIAM|M
97||She smiles.  Suddenly the thief is there.|stage direction||
98|THIEF|Excuse me.|speech|THIEF|M
99|ANNA|Yes.|speech|ANNA|F
100|THIEF|Can I have your autograph?|speech|THIEF|M
101|ANNA|What's your name?|speech|ANNA|F
102|THIEF|Rufus.|speech|THIEF|M
103||She signs his scruffy piece of paper.  He tries to read it.|stage direction||
104|THIEF|What does it say?|speech|THIEF|M
105|ANNA|"Well, that's the signature -- and
above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you
belong in jail.'"|speech|ANNA|F
106|THIEF|"Nice one.  Would you like my phone
number?"|speech|THIEF|M
107|ANNA|Tempting but... no, thank you.|speech|ANNA|F
108||Thief leaves.|stage direction||
109|ANNA|I think I will try this one.|speech|ANNA|F
110||"She hands William a $B!r(J20 note and the book he said was rubbish.
He talks as he handles the transaction."|stage direction||
111|WILLIAM|"Oh -- right -- on second thoughts
maybe it wasn't that bad.  Actually
-- it's a sort of masterpiece really.
None of those childish kebab
stories you get in so many travel
books these days.  And I'll throw in
one of these for free."|speech|WILLIAM|M
112||He drops in one of the signed books.|stage direction||
113|WILLIAM|"Very useful for lighting fires,
wrapping fish, that sort of things."|speech|WILLIAM|M
114||She looks at him with a slight smile.|stage direction||
115|ANNA|Thanks.|speech|ANNA|F
116||"And leaves.  She's out of his life forever.  William is a little
dazed.  Seconds later Martin comes back in."|stage direction||
117|MARTIN|Cappuccino as ordered.|speech|MARTIN|M
118|WILLIAM|"Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe
who was just in here."|speech|WILLIAM|M
119|MARTIN|Who?  Someone famous?|speech|MARTIN|M
120||But William's innate natural English discretion takes over.|stage direction||
121|WILLIAM|No. No-one -- no-one.|speech|WILLIAM|M
122||They set about drinking their coffees.|stage direction||
123|MARTIN|"Would be exciting if someone famous
did come into the shop though,
wouldn't it?  Do you know -- this is
pretty incredible actually -- I once
saw Ringo Starr.  Or at least I think
it was Ringo.  It might have been
that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof,'
Toppy."|speech|MARTIN|M
124|WILLIAM|Topol.|speech|WILLIAM|M
125|MARTIN|That's right -- Topol.|speech|MARTIN|M
126|WILLIAM|"But Ringo Starr doesn't look
anything like Topol."|speech|WILLIAM|M
127|MARTIN|"No, well... he was quite a long way
away."|speech|MARTIN|M
128|WILLIAM|So it could have been neither of them?|speech|WILLIAM|M
129|MARTIN|I suppose so.|speech|MARTIN|M
130|WILLIAM|"Right.  It's not a classic anecdotes,
is it?"|speech|WILLIAM|M
131|MARTIN|Not classic, no.|speech|MARTIN|M
132||Martin shakes his head.  William drains his cappuccino.|stage direction||
133|WILLIAM|Right -- want another one?|speech|WILLIAM|M
134|MARTIN|"Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy --
I'll have an orange juice."|speech|MARTIN|M

Portobello Road and bumps straight into Anna.  The orange

142|WILLIAM|Here, let me help.|speech|WILLIAM|M
143||"He grabs some paper napkins and starts to clean it off -- getting
far too near her breasts in the panic of it..."|stage direction||
144|ANNA|What are you doing?!|speech|ANNA|F
145||He jumps back.|stage direction||
146|WILLIAM|"Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just
over the street -- you could get
cleaned up."|speech|WILLIAM|M
147|ANNA|"No thank you.  I need to get my car
back."|speech|ANNA|F
148|WILLIAM|"I also have a phone.  I'm confident
that in five minutes we can have you
spick and span and back on the street
again... in the non-prostitute sense
obviously."|speech|WILLIAM|M
149||"In his diffident way, he is confident, despite her being
genuinely annoyed.  She turns and looks at him."|stage direction||
150|ANNA|"Okay.  So what does 'just over the
street' mean -- give it to me in yards."|speech|ANNA|F
151|WILLIAM|"Eighteen yards.  That's my house
there."|speech|WILLIAM|M

under the stairs, bins an unfinished pizza and hides a plate of
breakfast in a cupboard.  She enters the kitchen."|stage direction||

the stairs.  She walks down, wearing a short, sparkling black

is dazzled by the sight of her."|stage direction||

you go?"|speech|WILLIAM|M

some disgusting sugary drink
pretending to have something to do
with fruits of the forest?"|speech|WILLIAM|M
170|ANNA|Really, no.|speech|ANNA|F
171|WILLIAM|"Would you like something to nibble --
apricots, soaked in honey -- quite
why, no one knows -- because it stops
them tasting of apricots, and makes
them taste like honey, and if you
wanted honey, you'd just buy honey,
instead of apricots, but nevertheless
-- there we go -- yours if you want
them."|speech|WILLIAM|M
172|ANNA|No.|speech|ANNA|F
173|WILLIAM|Do you always say 'no' to everything?|speech|WILLIAM|M

heavenly."|speech|WILLIAM|M

talking man."|stage direction||

you've read that terrible book,
you're certainly not going to be
coming back to the shop."|speech|WILLIAM|M

187|WILLIAM|"'Surreal but nice.'  What was I
thinking?"|speech|WILLIAM|M

back, casually..."|stage direction||

196|ANNA|Thanks.  Well...|speech|ANNA|F
197||"They stand in that corridor -- in that small space.  Second time
saying goodbye.  A strange feeling of intimacy.  She leans
forward and she kisses him.  Total silence.  A real sense of the
strangeness of those lips, those famous lips on his.  They part."|stage direction||
198|WILLIAM|"I apologize for the 'surreal but nice'
comment.  Disaster..."|speech|WILLIAM|M

myself sometimes but... don't worry

This walk takes six months... as he walks, the seasons actually

back into spring...
First it is summer -- summer fruits and flowers -- a six-month
pregnant woman -- Honey with another leather-jacket boyfriend.
As he walks on the rain starts to fall -- he turns up his coat
collar -- umbrellas appear.  Followed by winter coats --
chestnuts roasting -- Christmas trees on sale and the first hint
of snow.
Then he comes to Blenheim Crescent, which is startling snowscape,
for the hundred yard, right across Ladbroke Grove.
By the time he reaches the purple cafe, the snow is melting and
in a few yards, it is spring again.  He passes Honey again --
arguing with her boyfriend, walking away tearful.  Then turns
past 'the pregnant woman' -- now holding her three-month baby.
