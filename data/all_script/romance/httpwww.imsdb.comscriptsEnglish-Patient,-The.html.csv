1	EXT.    LATE 1942.    THE SAHARA DESERT.    DAY.
SILENCE.  THE DESERT seen from the air.  An ocean of dunes  for mile
after mile.  The late sun turns the sand every color from crimson to
black.
An old AEROPLANE is flying over the Sahara.  Its shadow swims over the
contours of sand.
A woman's voice begins to sing unaccompanied on the track.  Szerelem,
szerelem, she cries, in a haunting lament for her loved one.
INSIDE the aeroplane are two figures.  One,  A WOMAN, seems to be
asleep.  Her pale head rests against the side of the cockpit.  THE
PILOT, a man, wears goggles and a leather helmet.  He is singing, too,
but we can't hear him or the plane or anything save the singer's
plaintive voice.
The plane shudders over a ridge.  Beneath it A SUDDEN CLUSTER OF MEN
AND MACHINES, camouflage nets draped over the sprawl of gasoline tanks
and armored vehicles.  An OFFICER, GERMAN, focuses his field glasses.
The glasses pick out the MARKINGS on the plane.  They are English.  An
ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN swivels furiously.
Shocking bursts of GUNFIRE.  Explosions rock the plane, which lurches
violently.  THE WOMAN SLUMPS FORWARD, slamming her head against the
instruments.  The pilot grabs her, pulls her back, but she's not
conscious.  The fuel tank above their heads is punctured.  It sprays
them both, then EXPLODES.
THE MAN FALLS OUT OF THE SKY, clinging to his dead lover.  The are both
ON FIRE.  She is wrapped in a parachute silk and it burns fiercely.  He
looks up to see the flames licking at his own parachute as it carries
them slowly to earth.  Even his helmet is on fire, but the man makes no
sound as the flames erase all that matters - his name, his past, his
face, his lover...
2	EXT.    THE DESERT.    1942.    DAY.
THE PILOT HAS BEEN RESCUED BY BEDOUIN TRIBESMEN.  Behind them the
wreckage of the plane, still smoking, the Arabs picking over it.  A
SILVER THIMBLE glints in the sun, is retrieved.  Another man comes
across A LARGE LEATHER-BOUND BOOK and takes it over to the Pilot.  The
Pilot is charred.  His helmet has melted into his head.  He's oblivious
to this, cares only about the woman who crashed with him.  He twists
frantically to find her.  Two men pick him up and carry him across to a
litter where they carefully wrap him in blankets.
3	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DUSK.
The Pilot is being carried across the desert.  A mask covers his face.
His view of the world is through the slats of reed.  He glimpses
camels, fierce low sun, the men who carry him.
4	EXT.    AN  OASIS.    DUSK.
The Pilot sees a man squat down beside him, takes a date from a sack
and begin to chew it.  Carefully, the Bedouin eases the mask from the
Pilot's face, leaving bandages of cloth and oil, but revealing a mouth.
He stops chewing and passes the pulped date into the Pilot's mouth.
Mouth to mouth.
4a*.	EXT.    DESERT.    DAWN.
THE CARAVANSERAI CROSSES THE DESERT, silhouetted against the dunes.
5	EXT.    AN  OASIS.    NIGHT.
The SOUND OF GLASS, of tiny chimes.  A music of glass.
AN ARAB HEAD APPEARS ON A MOVING TABLE IN THE DESERT.  It floats in
darkness, shimmering from the light of a fire.  The image develops to
reveal a man carrying a giant wooden yoke from which hang DOZENS OF
SMALL GLASS BOTTLES, on different lengths of string and wire.  He could
be an angel.
The man approaches the litter which carries the Pilot.  He's still in
the protective reed mask, wrapped in blankets.  The MERCHANT DOCTOR
stands over the burned body and sinks sticks either side of him deep
into the sand, then moves away, free of the yoke, which balances in the
support of the two crutches.  He puts some liquid in the Pilot's
tongue, whose eyes almost instantly begin to roll.  Then he slowly sets
about peeling away the layers of oiled cloth which protect the Pilot's
flesh.
The Merchant Doctor crouches in front of the curtain of bottles and
MAKES A SKIN CUP with the soles of his feet, then leans back to pluck,
hardly looking, certain bottles, which he uncorks and mixes in the bowl
he'd made with his feet.  This mixture he uses to anoint the burned
skin.  Next he finds green-black PASTE - ground Peacock Bone - and
BEGINS TO RUB IT on to the Pilot's rib cage.  All the while he us
humming and chanting.  The bottles continue to jingle.
6*.	EXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    EARLY 1945.    DAY.
The sand gives way to trees, the jingling bottles to distant church
bells, as A CONVOY OF TWENTY TRUCKS - Red Cross vehicles and some
supply vehicles - snakes along a bumpy hill road.  The war in Italy is
largely over and the Allies are moving up the country, the wounded and
supply lines slowly following.
7*.	INT.    RED CROSS TRUCK.    DAY.
A young CANADIAN NURSE, HANA, sits in a truck full of patients.  Hana
pays special care to the PATIENT lying in the stretcher alongside her.
This is the PILOT - now known as THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  A web of scars
covers the Patient's face and body.  They have the quality of a livid
tattoo, magenta and green-black.  The hair has largely gone and the
effect is curious, lassoing his features, the strong nose, the eyes
liquid.  It's a warrior's face.  But he has no physical strength.  He
coughs violently as the trucks shudders along the road.
8*.	EXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    DAY.
A JEEP pulls out of the line and approaches the Red Cross truck
containing Hana and the Patient.  The horn blows and Hana looks out to
see it contains her best friend, JAN.  TWO YOUNG SOLDIERS sit up front,
one driving, both grinning.  Jan signals for Hana's attention."|stage direction
1|JAN|"There's meant to be lace in the next
village - the boys are taking me."|speech
2|HANA|I'm not sewing anything else.|speech

4|JAN|"You don't have any money, do you?
Just in case there's silk."|speech
5|HANA|No!|speech
6|JAN|Hana, I know you do!|speech
7||"Hana leans under the tarpaulin, holding some DOLLARS.  The two hands -
hers and Jan's - reach for each other as the vehicles bump along side
by side.  They laugh at the effort.  Jan's GOLD BRACELET catches the
sun and glints."|stage direction
8|HANA|I'm not sewing anything else for you!|speech
9||(getting the money)|location
10|JAN|I love you.|speech
11||"The Jeep accelerates away.  Hana sighs to the patient.
Suddenly AN EXPLOSION shatters the calm as the jeep runs over a MINE.
The jeep is THROWN into the air.  The convoy halts and there's chaos as
soldiers run back pulling people out of the vehicles.  Hana runs the
other way, towards the accident, until she is prevented from passing by
a soldier.
9*.	EXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    LATER.
-- and there's still chaos as two SAPPERS arrive on motorcycles.  One
of them, a SIKH, wears a turban.
The motorcycles arrive at the front of the convoy.  A nurse, MARY, is
helping a doctor, OLIVER, attend to the injured driver.  The other two
bodies are covered with blankets.  There's blood everywhere.  The Sikh
and his colleague pull out the paraphernalia of their bomb disposal
equipment.
10	EXT.    ITALIAN HILL ROAD.    DAY.
KIP, the Sikh Lieutenant, and HARDY, his sergeant, explore the road
ahead of the becalmed convoy, using saucer-like METAL DETECTORS and
HEADSETS.  Kip is young, lithe, contained, utterly focused as they inch
along the debris-strewn road.  He stiffens as he registers metal.  With
a bayonet he carefully scrapes at the mud-caked surface.  Something
GLEAMS.  Suddenly, A PAIR OF FEET walks across his vision as HANA
HURRIES PAST, walking carelessly up the road.  It's so surreal that
neither man registers at first, and then Kip is shouting."|stage direction
12|KIP|Hey!  Hey!  Stop!  Hey!|speech
13|HARDY|Don't move!  Stand ABSOLUTELY STILL!|speech
14||Hana stops.  Hardy gingerly follows her footsteps.|unknown
15||(as he approaches)|location
16|HARDY|"Good, that's good, just stay still for me
and then we're going to be fine."|speech
17||He arrives at Hana.  Then grabs her.  He'd like to slap her face.|stage direction
18|HARDY|"What are you doing?!  What the bloody
hell do you think you're doing?"|speech
19||"By way of an answer she looks at the ground ahead of her feet.  Jan's
BRACELET lies in the mud.  Hardy bends down and collects the mangled
bracelet, presses it into Hana's hands.
11	EXT.    VILLAGE.    DUSK.
The CONVOY is threading through A RUINED VILLAGE, passing the souvenirs
of war.  An overturned vehicle now used as a game by some children,
dejected refugees tramping along the side of the road.  From the end of
one of the buildings are hanging HALF A DOZEN CORPSES, strung upside
down with crude placards denouncing, in Italian, their collaboration
with the Nazis.
12	INT.    RED CROSS TRUCK.    CONTINUOUS.
Hana sees all this as she sits blankly inside the truck, the Patient
swaying alongside her.  She puts out her hand to steady him.
13*.	EXT.    CONVOY SITE, ITALY.    DUSK.
THE CONVOY is making a PITSTOP.  The trucks are silhouetted in a line.
Hana helps lift the Patient's stretcher onto the ground.  She bends to
him."|stage direction
20|HANA|Do you need something?|speech
21||"The Patient nods.  Hana gets up to prepare MORPHINE INJECTION from a
small kit.  Mary arrives.  Touches Hana gently, conscious of her grief
for Jan's death."|stage direction
22|MARY|"Are you okay?  Oh God, Hana, you were
like sisters."|speech
23||(sighs angrily)|location
24|HANA|"We keep moving him - in and out of the
truck.  Why?  He's dying.  What's the point?"|speech
25|MARY|"Well, we can't hardly leave him.  Do
you mean leave him?  We can't."|speech
26||"Hana has settled down beside the Patient's stretcher.  She draws
herself up against the night.  On the hill above, she can see the
outline of A SMALL MONASTERY in the moonlight.  She's crying, her face
a frozen mask."|stage direction
27|HANA|"I must be a curse.  Anybody who loves me,
anybody who gets close to me -
or I must be cursed.  Which is it?"|speech
28||"The Patient laces her fingers into his crabbed hand.
14	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.
Hana is investigating the MONASTERY OF ST. ANNA, wandering through its
overgrown gardens, past a pond.  What sanctuary it seems to offer.
15*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY LIBRARY.    DAY.
Hana explores via a gaping hole in a LIBRARY where the walls have
collapsed from shelling.  The garden intrudes, ivy curls around the
shelves.  Bloated books lie abandoned, and there's a PIANO tiled up on
one side.  Hana presses the keys through the filthy tarpaulin which
covers it.  Everywhere there are signs of a brief German occupation.
15a*.	INT.    MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    DAY.
Past the Library is a CLOISTERS, drenched with silver light.
15b*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY STAIRS.    DAY.
Hana goes upstairs, negotiating a huge VOID in the stone treads two
thirds of the way up.
15c*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.
She comes across a small CHAPEL, with the remains of murals and an
altar pressed into service by the Germans as a table.  Hana finds an
old bed, and a mattress.
16	EXT.    THE MONASTERY GARDEN.    DAY.
Hana comes out, passes a DRY WATER TROUGH.  She hears a rustling on the
gravel and turns to see A TORTOISE ambling towards the trough.  On cue
there's A GURGLING SOUND.  THE HANDLELESS PUMP IS SUDDENLY GUSHING,
splashing water everywhere.  The Tortoise, clearly arriving for this,
enjoys a welcome shower.  Hana goes to the trough, dips her hands into
the water.  Looks around her, and makes a decision.
17	EXT.    CONVOY SITE.    ITALY.    DAY.
The Convoy is in the final stages of loading up.  Oliver passes the
vehicles, deep in dispute with a determined Hana, who is carrying some
sacks of rice."|stage direction
29|HANA|"The war's over - you told me yourself.
How can it be desertion?"|speech
30|OLIVER|"It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean
literally."|speech
31|HANA|When he dies I'll catch up.|speech
32||"Oliver hovers as Hana adds the rice to a small cache of provisions,
then lays another blanket over the Patient."|stage direction
33|OLIVER|"It's not safe here.  The whole country's
crawling with Bandits and Germans and God
knows what.  It's madness.  I can't allow it.
You're not, this is natural - it's shock.
For all of us.  Hana -"|speech
34|HANA|I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.|speech
35||(clutching at straws)|location
36|OLIVER|And what if he really is a spy?|speech
37||(impatiently)|location
38|HANA|He can't even move.|speech
39|OLIVER|"If anything happened to you I'd never
forgive myself."|speech
40||Hana nods.  A tiny smile.  Oliver shrugs helplessly.|stage direction
41|OLIVER|"We're heading for Leghorn.  Livorno the
Italians call it.  We'll expect you."|speech
42||"18*.	INT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.
TWO SOLDIERS are helping Mary and Hana carry the Patient into the
monastery.  Hana indicates the stairs."|stage direction
43|HANA|Up there.|speech
44||"They struggle up the stairs, one of the Soldiers gasping as he narrowly
avoids falling into the void in the stairs.  The cot almost tips up, at
which the Patient SUDDENLY SPEAKS, his voice cracked and rasping, but
still clearly aristocratic."|stage direction
45|THE PATIENT|"There was a Prince, who was dying, and
he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he
could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills.
Am I that Prince?"|speech
46||Hana laughs.|stage direction
47|HANA|"Because you're leaning?  No, you're
just on an angle.  You're too heavy!"|speech
48||"Mary laughs.  They reach the landing.  Hana kicks open the door to the
CHAPEL."|stage direction
49|HANA|In here.|speech
50||"18a*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.
Hana lets Mary take the weight while she goes to the bed and pulls away
the drapes, sending up a cloud of dust.  They lower the Patient onto
the bed.  She turns to the SOLDIERS."|stage direction
51|HANA|Thank you.|speech
52||"She shuts the door on them, leaving Mary staring aghast at the room,
its faded frescoes, its mold, its chaos.  Hana smiles, opens a shutter
to let a fierce envelope of light into the room."|stage direction
53|HANA|Good.|speech
54||She goes to Mary and hugs her.|unknown
55||"19*.	INT.    HANA'S ROOM.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.
A smaller upstairs room completely bare.  As Hana tugs off her uniform,
she looks out of the window to see the departing Convoy.  A cotton
dress goes on over her head and she emerges looking suddenly younger
and rather fragile.   THROUGH THE DAMAGED FLOOR OF HER ROOM SHE HAS A
VIEW OF THE PATIENT BELOW HER.  SHE LOOKS AT HIM.  NOW SHE HAS SCISSORS
AND STARTS TO CUT OFF HER HAIR, NOT AGGRESSIVELY, BUT IN A GESTURE OF A
NEW BEGINNING.
19a*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.
HANA walks down to the Patient's Room and stands in the doorway.  The
Patient turns his head to her.  He's grinning.  He puts up a thumb.  On
the track a song begins:  Some Other Time.
20*.	EXT.  BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.  1938.  LATE DAY.
THE SONG CONTINUED IN THE DESERT where we find the singer - PETER
MADOX, a weather-beaten man who is working on the guts of an BATTERED
TIGER MOTH AEROPLANE.  His face is blackened with oil.  A second
European, ALMÁSY, stands beside him, holding tools and a section of the
camshaft.  Madox yanks out a perished rubber hose and holds it up for
Almasy to inspect.  Behind them is an ENCAMPMENT - some camels foraging
in the meager scrub, half a dozen black tents of the BEDOUIN: guides
and servants to the Almásy/Madox Expedition.  It's 1938 and the whole
continent is full of such expeditions, competing with each other,
pursuing lost treasures, sources of rivers, hidden cities.
D'AGOSTINO, the team's Italian ARCHEOLOGIST, drives towards the plane
in one of the expedition's adapted FORD MOTORCARS.  He gets out
carrying a large earthenware WATER JAR.  He looks very pleased with
himself as he shows the jar to Almásy and then passes it to Madox."|stage direction
56|D'AGOSTINO|Thirsty?|speech
57||(sniffing inside)|location
58|MADOX|What's this?|speech
59|D'AGOSTINO|Don't drink it!|speech
60||"He reaches for the jug, then pours out a little sludge - it's a
brackish and stinks.  Madox makes a face."|stage direction
61|D'AGOSTINO|"I can't guarantee the vintage, my
friends.  I just dug it out of the hill."|speech
62||Madox and Almásy have seen many such jugs.|stage direction
63|MADOX|Excellent.  That's terrific, D'Ag.|speech
64||(to Almásy, of a tool)|location
65|MADOX|Toss that up, would you.|speech
66||(mischievously)|location
67|D'AGOSTINO|There are some others.|speech
68||"21	EXT.    POTTERY HILL.    DAY.
THE BASE OF A HILL SEEMS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF POTTERY JARS.
D'Agostino emerges over the brow of a dune, leading Madox and Almásy.
The other members of the team are already there - BERMANN, a German
PHOTOGRAPHER and FOUAD, EGYPTOLOGIST from Cairo."|stage direction
69||(to Almásy, astonished)|location
70|MADOX|My God, look at this!|speech
71||"They bend to touch the jars, literally hundreds of them, mostly broken,
piled on top of each other.  Bermann approaches them, carrying his
tripod."|stage direction
72|BERMANN|Incredible, Hmm?  Quite incredible.|speech
73|D'AGOSTINO|"I've never seen anything like it.  There
would have been enough water here to
serve an army."|speech
74||(gloomily)|location
75|ALMÁSY|Which means we're in the wrong place.|speech
76||Almásy speaks with a slight but unmistakable European accent.|stage direction
77|D'AGOSTINO|Why?|speech
78|ALMÁSY|"Would you stockpile water near to an
Oasis?  There can't be a natural spring
within fifty miles of here."|speech
79|FOUAD|Or they didn't know of one.|speech
80|BERMANN|"So, it may not be Zerzura, still
incredible."|speech
81||(nodding, delighted)|location
82|D'AGOSTINO|A pottery hill!|speech
83|ALMÁSY|A wild goose chase.|speech
84||(firmly)|location
85|MADOX|No.|speech
86||Almásy gives him a look.  But Madox will have none of it.|stage direction
87|MADOX|"No.  Now we look in the other places.
We're eliminating."|speech
88||The unmistakable buzz of AN AEROPLANE distracts them.|stage direction
89|MADOX|Good, and here comes reinforcements.|speech
90||"21a*.	EXT.    BASE CAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DAY.
LATER and a smart new aeroplane, a STEERMAN, makes a smooth landing on
the flat desert.  The expedition team drives over to meet the arrivals.
Almásy is not with them.  He's walking, apparently not so enthusiastic.
A young, kissed and newly-married couple emerge from the plane.  They
are GEOFFREY AND KATHARINE CLIFTON.
And it's immediately clear that Katharine is the woman in the plane-
crash at the beginning of the film.
Madox makes all the introductions.  Hands are shaken, hellos all round,
as the couple disembark in their leather flying gear.  Geoffrey removes
his helmet and, in what we will come to know as an ubiquitous gesture,
produces a bottle of CHAMPAGNE and sets off the cork with a flourish."|stage direction
91|CLIFTON|"I hereby Christen us the International
Sand Club!"|speech
92||"22	EXT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    LATE DAY.
The party is in the shade of the tents.  Almásy joins the group.  Madox
nods over to the Clifton plane."|stage direction
93|MADOX|Marvelous plane.  Did you look?|speech
94||(beaming at Almásy)|location
95|CLIFTON|"Isn't it?  Wedding present from
Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it
Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton."|speech
96|MADOX|"We can finally consign my old bird
to the scrapheap."|speech

98|D'AGOSTINO|Mrs. Clifton - Count Almasy.|speech
99||(smiling, offering her hand)|location
100|KATHARINE|"Geoffrey gave me your monograph when
I was reading up on the desert.
Very impressive."|speech
101||(stiff)|location
102|ALMÁSY|Thank you.|speech
103|KATHARINE|"I wanted to meet a man who could write
such a long paper with so few adjectives."|speech
104|ALMÁSY|"A thing is still a thing no matter what
you place in front of it.  Big car, slow
car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car."|speech
105||(joining them and joining in)|location
106|CLIFTON|A broken car?|speech
107|ALMÁSY|Still a car.|speech
108||(hands them champagne)|location
109|CLIFFTON|Not much use, though.|speech
110|KATHARINE|"Love?  Romantic love, platonic love,
filial love - ?  Quite different things,
surely?"|speech
111||(hugging Katharine)|location
112|CLIFTON|"Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind
of love.  Excessive love of one's wife."|speech

115||"23	INT.  THE PATIENT'S ROOM.  THE MONASTERY.  MORNING.
The morning floods into the room.  The Patient lies, lost in the
desert.  Then a sudden CLATTERING NOISE disturbs him.
24	INT.   STAIRS, THE MONASTERY.   DAY.
Hana is dropping armfuls of books into the cavities of the damaged
stairs, and with others, she is improvising new steps.  The heavy
volumes are perfect for treading on.
25	INT.   LIBRARY.   DAY.
Hana comes in, gathers up another armful of books and carries them out
to continue her stair repairs.

Hana enters."|stage direction
116|THE PATIENT|"What was all the banging?  Were you
fighting rats or the entire German army?"|speech
117|HANA|"I was repairing the stairs.  I found a
library and the books were very useful."|speech
118||"Hana shrugs.  She's attending to him, pulling back the sheets, plumping
up the pillows.  He's short of breath."|stage direction
119|THE PATIENT|"Before you find too many uses for these
books would you read some to me?"|speech
120|HANA|"I think they're all in Italian, but I'll
look, yes.  What about your own book?"|speech
121||(reluctant)|location
122|THE PATIENT|"My book?  The Herodotus?  Yes, we
can read him."|speech

in her pockets."|stage direction

in the orchard.  We have an orchard!"|speech
125||She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.|stage direction
126|THE PATIENT|Thank you.|speech
127||"His mouth works with the pleasure of the taste, a little juice escaping
from the mouth.  Hana mops it up."|stage direction

129||A noise, GURGLING sound, disturbs them.|stage direction
130|THE PATIENT|What's that?|speech
131||"27	INT/EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.
Hana comes through the Cloisters into the garden as the gurgling
increases.  She's in time to catch the TORTOISE arriving once again in
the WATER TROUGH just as it starts to gush with water.  She shouts up
to The Patient's open window."|stage direction
132|HANA|Water!|speech
133||(bends to the Tortois)|location
134|HANA|You hear it, too, don't you!|speech
135||"28	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.
Close on the HERODOTUS.  The Patient opens its cover, held together by
leather ties.  Loose PAPERS, PHOTOGRAPHS, HAND-DRAWN MAPS AND SKETCHES
are all collected between the pages.  He claws at some water-colors
which appear to be based on CAVE PAINTINGS - figures, dark-skinned
warriors of the stone age, some with bows in their hands, others with
plumes in their hair - arranged in abstract patterns uncannily like
those of Matisse.  Some appear to be swimming, another is diving.  Then
the Patient loses control of the papers and the whole parcel SPILLS to
the floor with a crack.
29	INT.    BASECAMP AT POTTERY HILL.    DUSK.
A SHOT RINGS OUT, disturbing the evening meal.  Almásy and others go
outside.  Silhouetted on a ridge, a group of men sit astride camels.
One of them holds his rifle aloft, clearly pointing towards the sky -
means friend.  Fouad peers at the horizon."|stage direction

ALMÁSY AND MADOX WALK OUT TO INTERCEPT THE ARRIVALS as the first Arab
dismounts, the procession of camels splaying out as if in collapse.
Almásy speaks in Arabic, exchanging the ritual greetings.
DURING THIS, FENELON-BARNES, sole European in this expedition, has
finally persuaded his camel to sit, and dismounts irritably, slapping
the animal in disgust."|stage direction

THEY ALL GET OUT."|stage direction

585|KATHARINE|"I insist.  There clearly isn't room for
us all, I'm the least able to dig, and

persuading my husband to abandon
whatever he's doing and rescue us."|speech
586||"It's hard to argue with this logic.  Almásy shrugs.
LATER - THE MADOX CAR makes a more effective departure.  And Almasy and
Katharine are left alone.  THEY LOOK AT EACH OTHER as if realizing this
for the first time.  Almasy immediately returns to the two damaged
vehicles and helps the men stretch the cut canvas which was once a tent
TO FASHION A MAKESHIFT SHELTER BETWEEN THE TWO CARS.  Katharine goes to
join them.  There is no obstacle to the remorseless horizon, just miles
of undulating dunes.
79	INT.    SHELTER.    DAY.
Almásy sits alone, writing into HIS HERODOTUS, a map folded in front of
him, from which he makes notes.  Katherine comes across with a clutch
of her SKETCHES from the Cave wall.  Hands them to him.  They're
beautiful."|stage direction

permits.  He continues with his maps.
80	EXT.    THE DESERT.    NIGHT.
Katharine sits alone on top of the Dune, smoking, surveying the
landscape.  Below her the makeshift camp - a fresh wind flicking at the
tarpaulin, THE DEEP TRACKS OF MADOX'S CAR STRETCHING OFF TOWARDS
CIVILIZATION.  Almásy emerges from the tent and, locating Katharine,
heads towards her."|stage direction

The team hurries around the improvised tent, weighing it down with
packing cases, gasoline drums, water cans, bringing anything loose or
light inside the tarpaulin.  THE WIND is whipping up, the air busy with
sand.  Almásy pushes everyone under cover.
82	INT.    SHELTER.    NIGHT.
THE SAND SEEMS TO BE SCOURING THE TARPAULIN.  Kamal and Almásy try to
secure one vulnerable area, but suddenly there are leaks everywhere and
the sand swarms inside.
It's noisy, too, and Almásy has to shout to make himself understood,
indicating to the Bedouin to grab water and blankets and food, all the
valuables, and get out.  He himself finds blankets and water and shouts
at Katharine to do the same.  One side of the canvas suddenly RIPS
apart like paper. Chaos as figures struggle in ever-worsening
conditions, sand blizzarding the air.
83	EXT.    SHELTER.    NIGHT.
THE SHELTER FLIES INTO THE AIR, stranding the figures, their heads
wrapped in blankets, flashlights useless.  They seek safety in two
groups, the tribesmen to the cabin of the overturned car, Katharine and
Almásy to the upright one.
84	INT.    CAR.    NIGHT.
Inside the cabin, the sand swirling around them, Katharine and Almásy
sit without speaking.  Dawn is trying to break through.  He pours a
little water into a mug so that they can wash out their eyes and noses

Almásy is woken by sound of A DISTANT ENGINE.  He jerks up, waking
Katharine in the process, and heaves against the door.  He can't open
it, and has to lean his feet against the passenger door, lying across
Katharine, kicking it open.
89*.	EXT.    THE DESERT.    DAY.
By the time Almásy emerges from the car, the sand pouring into the
cabin, MADOX'S CAR IS ROARING ALONG THE HORIZON.  Almásy waves, shouts,
and then runs back into the car, finds his flare-gun, and SENDS A FLARE
high into the sky.  Katharine is with him now, and they watch,
helplessly, as the car bounces away from them, Madox a man on a

Katharine sits in the car, putting her pictures into the Herodotus.
It's full of ALMÁSY'S HANDWRITING, PHOTOGRAPHS, SOME PRESSED FLOWERS.
She deciphers a page of his words and drawings.  It's almost
exclusively about her, the lines studded with K.s.  She reads,
astonished, then looks at him as he and two of the three Bedouin circle
the area of the cars in ever-widening circles, like water-diviners,
like Kip searches for mines.  Kamal is slumped against the front of the
car.  He's sick.  Almásy suddenly drops to his knees and begins to
shovel into the sand.  He pulls out A CAN OF WATER.  Turns to Katharine
and holds it triumphantly in the air.

room, the shutters closed, just the thinnest shaft of light piercing
the gloom.  Almásy hasn't even removed his clothes, his boots kicked
off below his jutting feet.
There's A KNOCK at the door.  Almásy sleeps.  Another.  A third.  He's
roused from the dead.  Stumbles to his feet, opens the door as the
knocking continues.
It's Katharine.  She's bathed, luminous, stands back-lit by the
afternoon sun - an angel in a cotton dress.  She walks past him into

Kip and Hana have been detained at a ROAD BLOCK.  Kip is being

They enter the Church.  It's in almost total darkness.  THEN A FLARE
SUDDENLY ILLUMINATES THE INTERIOR.  It's magnificent.  Kip holds the
flare, crimson on one arm, green pouring up from the other.  Hana walks
behind him, still perplexed.  There is PROTECTIVE SCAFFOLDING
EVERYWHERE, AND SANDBAGS PILED UP HIGH AROUND THE ALTARS, AND THE
STATUES.
A SECOND FLARE.  Kip has appeared through A SECRET DOOR high in the
church, literally emerging from one of the frescoes which are
momentarily visible.  He flings a rope over the rafters.
Now Kip circles Hana with the rope, MAKING A SLING across her waist and
shoulder.  He lights a smaller flair and hands it to her before
disappearing.
Hana stands holding the flare.  She can't see Kip, can only hear him
scrambling."|stage direction
1156|HANA|Kip?|speech
1157||"He runs up the sandbags, right up into the rafters.  He collects the
other end of the rope which is attached to Hana.  Holding onto it, he
just STEPS OFF INTO THE DARKNESS.
SIMULTANEOUSLY HANA IS SWUNG UP INTO THE AIR, her startled yelp echoing
around the Church.  Kip touches ground, while Hana swings through
space, coming to rest about three feet from the FRESCOED WALLS, painted
by Piero Della Francesca.  Hana's flare makes a halo around her head.
Now Kip, on the ground, still holding the rope, walks forward and
causes Hana to SWING to the right.  She lets out a giddy laugh,
exhilarated and nervous, and she flies, illuminating - en passant -
faces, bodies, angels.  Kip guides the rope as if they were making
love, which in a way they are.
Hana arrives, hovering, in front of THE QUEEN OF SHEBA TALKING TO
SOLOMON. She's overwhelmed.  She reaches out to touch the giant neck of
the sad Queen.
Kip slowly lets her down, paying out the length of the rope.  Hana's
face is full of tears.  He smiles, holds her.

the harbor is pounded, the steady thud of explosions.  TOBRUK IS UNDER

at open desks. IN A LINE, WEARING HIS SHABBY SUIT, IS CARAVAGGIO.  AN
ARAB WOMAN in front of him is arguing over the identity of her
ominously CAUCASIAN-LOOKING CHILD.  An INTERPRETER mediates.  The
OFFICER doesn't believe the woman.  She's getting frantic at the
possibility of losing her child.
Suddenly there's a disturbance as a WOMAN is dragged along the line by
her hair.  She's bloodied, and has been tortured, and it's hard to
recognize her as the pretty AICHA.  She touches a couple of people in
the line.  They're horrified.  Soldiers pull them away.  Caravaggio
doesn't look, stares straight ahead.  An officer watches him AS HE
TURNS BRIEFLY AND HELPLESSLY OUT OF CONCERN FOR HER.  THEIR EYES CATCH

efficient and sickening snap.
He finds the KEY to the handcuffs, unlocks them, grabs the soldier and
drags him into the empty lavatory.
189	INT.    TRAIN.    THE DESERT.    EVENING.
Almásy arrives at the rear of the train, passes the Kitchen carriage,
where Arabs sweat over the boiler.  He pulls open the back door only to
surprise a GUARD, who's lolling casually, enjoying the sunset.  Almásy
SHOOTS HIM with his stole rifle.  He clambers over the guard rail and
leaps off the train - tumbling into the desert sunset.
190	EXT.    RAILWAY TRACK.    THE DESERT.    EVENING.
Almásy, silhouetted against the evening sky, walks back down the track,
THREE HUNDRED MILES AWAY from the dying Katharine Clifton, no way now
of saving her.  He is a tiny speck in the vast desert.  His heart
broken.  He sinks to his knees in despair.
191*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    NIGHT.
The Patient is exhausted.  He has said aloud what has tortured him.
His failure to save Katharine.  He looks at Caravaggio."|stage direction
1585|THE PATIENT|"So yes.  She died because of me.
Because I loved her.  Because I
had the wrong name."|speech
1586||"192	INT.    THE MONASTERY STABLES.    DAY.
Kip is working at a BLACKSMITH'S FORGE in the Stables.  He is heating
pieces of metal.  He has arranged his material on a bench - a bayonet,
a rifle, a piece of bomb casting."|stage direction
1587||Hana enters, goes up, hugs him from behind.|unknown
1588|HANA|What are you up to?|speech
1589|KIP|"That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon -
Zamzammah - remember?  That was
made out of the metal of ordinary things.
I want to make an ordinary thing
out of guns."|speech
1590||His bayonet is thrust into the forge.  It's red hot.|stage direction
1591|KIP|"When I went to England I was amazed at
what went on, the waste - I'd been taught
to re-use everything, the dung from a cow
to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a
typewriter - India could live for a
hundred years on what I saw thrown away."|speech
1592|HANA|I should go to the house, get breakfast.|speech
1593|KIP|"The lamp was burning all night in his
room.  Caravaggio was there with him."|speech
1594||She goes to kiss him.   He is over the fire and protests.|stage direction

1596||(teasing him)|location
1597|HANA|Nya-nya-nya!|speech
1598||"193*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.
Caravagio is injecting the Patient with morphine."|stage direction
1599|CARAVAGGIO|"And did you never see Katharine?  You
never got back to the Cave?"|speech
1600|THE PATIENT|"Yes, I got back there finally to keep
my promise.  To come back for her.
And then of course I couldn't... I
couldn't even do that properly."|speech
1601||"194	INT.    THE MONASTERY STABLES.    DAY.
Kip hammers the metal into its new shape.  He stops, distracted by
something he's listening to on his crystal set.  It's new he seems not
to fully understand, about a bomb dropping on Japan.  A NEW KIND OF
BOMB.
THE METAL GLOWS A VIVID RED ON THE ANVIL.
Suddenly Kip slops it into the trough of water, sending a great hissing
column of steam.
195*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.
Caravaggio sits by the Patient."|stage direction
1602|CARAVAGGIO|"You get to the morning and the
poison leaks away, doesn't it?
Black nights, fucking black nights,
when you want to howl like a dog.
I thought I would kill you.  You
killed my friends, you ruined my
hands.  But the girl was always
here, like some Guardian Angel."|speech
1603|THE PATIENT|You can't kill me.  I died years ago.|speech
1604|CARAVAGGIO|No, now I can't kill you.|speech
1605||"Kip storms into the room, walks straight up to the Patient and POINTS A
GUN AT HIM.  Caravaggio is taken by surprise."|stage direction
1606|CARAVAGGIO|Kip - what are - ?|speech
1607|KIP|Stay out of this.|speech
1608|THE PATIENT|Kip?|speech
1609|KIP|"I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother
always said I was a fool.  Never trust the
British, he said: the deal-makers, the
map-makers; never shake hands with them."|speech
1610|THE PATIENT|What are you talking about?|speech
1611|KIP|"What have I been doing all this time?
Do you know how many mines I've seen? -
more mines than there are soldiers, more -
how many mines we've put in the ground
ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped
out of the sky.  And now this."|speech
1612||He approaches the bed.  Caravaggio tries to intervene.|stage direction
1613|CARAVAGGIO|Kip, listen -|speech
1614||Kip sings the rifle at him, KNOCKING HIM to the floor.|stage direction
1615|KIP|I said keep out of this!|speech
1616||"He pulls of his earphones and rams them around the Patient's head,
dropping the set onto the bed.  The Patient listens, coughing."|stage direction
1617|KIP|"Can you hear?  Can you hear what they're
celebrating?  I listened to you, Uncle.
Sitting at your feet - always sitting at
somebody's feet - trying to learn.  The
right way to hold a teacup, otherwise
you're out, the pukkah knot in your tie -
as if everything can be explained in
terms of a cricket bat and an accent."|speech
1618|CARAVAGGIO|Kip -|speech
1619|KIP|"Kip! - it's not even my name because
you can't say it.  Kirpal Singh Bhuller
is my name."|speech
1620||Hana runs in, alerted by the commotion, stunned by what she sees.|stage direction
1621|CARAVAGGIO|Well, then ask him his name!|speech
1622||(getting in between Kip and the Patient)|location
1623|HANA|"What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening?
Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody."|speech
1624|KIP|"They're excited!  They're happy about
destroying a whole city.  Would they
do that to a White Man's City?  Never!"|speech
1625||(pulling off the earphones)|location
1626|THE PATIENT|Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.|speech
1627|CARAVAGGIO|"Kip, listen, he lost everything because
he wasn't English - Jesus! - shoot me,
I'm more English than he is!"|speech
1628||"Kip levels the gun at the Patient.  Then breaks it open, throws it down
on the bed, next to the earphones, from which the news continues to
leak, some words audible - Eunola Gay... Hiroshima... and from
different voices - It was beautiful!  just beautiful!  Bang! the
biggest bang you ever saw!
196	EXT.    KIP'S TENT.    LATE DAY.
Hana approaches.  Kip is inside the tent, the flap zipped.  She sees
his shadow move, then freeze as she calls his name.  It's like a
confessional.  The flap between them, the man in shadows, Hana
crouched, forlorn."|stage direction
1629|HANA|Kip.  Kip.  It's me.|speech
1630||(no response)|location
1631|HANA|"Why?  It's another bomb.  However
big, what's the difference?  There've
been so many bombs.  What about
Coventry?  What about Dresden?
Where were those cities?"|speech
1632||(no response)|location
1633|HANA|I don't understand.  Let me come in.|speech
1634||"The shadow doesn't move.  Hana is at a loss.
197	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    EVENING.
The Patient becomes aware of something in the room, opens his eyes,
squints into the darkness and sees A FIGURE hovering against the wall.
He's in the Cave, he thinks, he's seeing the painted figures moving,
he's seeing the Swimmer.
KIP - bare chested, no turban, hair loose - stands in the shadows at
the foot of the Patient's bed.
198	INT.    HANA'S ROOM.    EVENING.
Kip comes into the room.  Hana sits in the corner.  She is nervous of
him, his look, his intensity."|stage direction
1635|KIP|Will you come with me?|speech
1636|HANA|Of course.  When?|speech
1637|KIP|I mean home.  India.|speech
1638|HANA|Kip... I -|speech
1639||(interrupting this)|location
1640|KIP|"I know - here I am always a brown man,
there you would be always a white woman."|speech
1641|HANA|"Is that what you think?  Is that what
you think I think?"|speech
1642|KIP|It's what I've learned.|speech
1643|HANA|"I'm thinking about your heart, not
your skin.  And how to reach it.  And
that I don't think I can.  A bomb
has ruined us, just not the bomb
I thought would ruin us."|speech
1644||She stands, goes to him.|stage direction
1645|HANA|"I've clung to you.  I've clung to you.
Kip.  Life  a raft."|speech
1646||(clinging to her)|location
1647|KIP|Then come with me.|speech
1648||"199	EXT.    THE MONASTERY.    DAY.
Next morning and Kip has attached what he was making in the forge - A
NEW HANDLE - to the pump.  Now he works it, producing a steady stream
of water.  His motorbike is against the wall.  He goes to it.
Caravaggio is watching.  He hugs Kip, wrapping his arms around the boy
like a bear.
199a*.	EXT.    HANA'S VEGETABLE GARDEN.    DAY.
HANA stands by her Vegetable Garden.  Kip stops the motorbike.  She
goes to him, stands, FASTENS THE TOP BUTTON of his coat.  You feel she
might jump on the seat behind him.  But she doesn't."|stage direction
1649|HANA|"I'll always go back to that church.
Look at my painting."|speech
1650|KIP|I'll always go back to that church.|speech
1651|HANA|So one day we'll meet.|speech
1652||"He nods, winds up the throttle, and is gone.
200	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.
Hana comes in carrying FLOWERS and sets them down on the table next to
a clutch of MORPHINE AMPOULES.  She picks up the hypodermic to prepare
his injection.  She takes a phial.  THE PATIENT REACHES OUT AND PUSHES
TWO MORE TOWARDS HER.   THEIR EYES MEET, THEN HE SHOVELS ANOTHER, THEN
ALL OF THEM.  She looks at him.  IT'S A MASSIVE, LETHAL DOSE.
Hana starts to prepare the injection, her eyes filling with tears.  The
Patient nods, smiles, whispers."|stage direction
1653|THE PATIENT|Thank you.  Thank you.|speech
1654||She kisses him, gently on the mouth.  He closes his eyes.|stage direction

1656||"201*.	EXT.(NEAR THE) BASECAMP. CAVE OF SWIMMERS. 1942. DAY.
The familiar cleft in the rocks.  A PLANE is coming in to land.
202	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    TORCHLIGHT.
A flashlight flickers in the cave.  ALMÁSY APPEARS.
KATHARINE'S CORPSE lies where he left her - a ghost on a bed of silk
and blankets.  The chill of the cave has preserved her.  She could be
asleep.  She clutches the Herodotus."|stage direction
1657|ALMÁSY|Katharine, my darling.|speech
1658||"He sobs, whispering to her.  He's terribly cold, exhausted.  He slips
underneath the covers to be next to her, and closes his eyes."|stage direction
1659|ALMÁSY|I'm so tired.|speech
1660||"203*.	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.
The Patient is slipping away.  Hana is reading from the last pages of
the Herodotus where KATHARINE HAS WRITTEN IN THE MARGINS."|stage direction
1661|HANA|"My darling, I'm waiting for you - how
long is a day in the dark, or a week?"|speech

THE BED, SMILING, STROKING HIS HEAD, SPEAKING TO HIM.
204	INT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    FLASHLIGHT.
Katharine is writing.  The FLASHLIGHT is faint.  She shivers."|stage direction
1663|KATHARINE (O/S)|"...the fire is gone now, and I'm
horribly cold.  I really ought to
drag myself outside but then
there would be the sun..."|speech
1664||"She passes the flashlight across the wall, the painted figures dancing
in the pale light."|stage direction
1665|KATHARINE (O/S)|"I'm afraid I waste the light on the
paintings and on writing these words..."|speech
1666||"205	INT.    THE PATIENT'S ROOM.    DAY.
THE BED IS EMPTY, THE MATTRESS STRIPPED.  Hana stands in the doorway,

read."|stage direction

tribes, tastes we have swallowed..."|speech
1668||"206*.	EXT.    LANE OUTSIDE THE MONASTERY GARDEN.    DAY.
Caravaggio is at the gate to the Monastery.  The TRUCK we saw before is
waiting with him.  The PARTISAN with his head bandana and shotgun
remains the same, but now there are CHILDREN in the back and a WOMAN
sits behind the man, nursing a two-year-old."|stage direction
1669|CARAVAGGIO|Hana!  Come on!|speech
1670||"He gets up into the BALUSTRADE, tentatively finds his balance, then
starts to walk, heel to toe - slowly, and then with more confidence -
along the long thin line of stone.  The children watch intently.  He
turns and bows."|stage direction
1671|KATHARINE (O/S)|"...bodies we have entered and swum up
like rivers, fears we have hidden in
like this wretched cave..."|speech
1672||"207*.	EXT.    THE MONASTERY CLOISTERS.    DAY.
Hana walks across the cloisters, passing the chalked hopscotch squares,
leaving it all behind.  Then she stops, bends, retrieves A SNAIL SHELL,
keeps going.  KATHARINE'S VOICE CONTINUES.
208	INT.    THE CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    TORCHLIGHT.
ALMÁSY SMUDGES KATHARINE'S PALE FACE WITH COLOR.  OCHRE across her
brow, BLUE on her eyelids, RED on her lips.  He presses his cheek to
hers, smoothes her hair."|stage direction
1673|KATHARINE (O/S)|"...I want all this marked on my body.
We are the real countries, not the
boundaries drawn on maps with the
names of powerful men..."|speech

woman driver, Gioia.  She and Caravaggio smile like lovers."|stage direction
1675|CARAVAGGIO|Hana - this is Gioia.|speech

brother and wife, their children.   She smiles at them."|stage direction
1677|HANA|Buon' giorno.|speech
1678|CARAVAGGIO|She can take you as far as Florence.|speech
1679|HANA|I can get in the back.|speech
1680||"And she clambers up, sits down between the children.  They exchange
some small stiff, shy smiles, and then the truck bounces away.  Hana
takes one final look at the Monastery as it disappears around the bend
and then turns and confronts the life insisting noisily in the truck.
210	EXT.    CAVE OF SWIMMERS.    DAY.
Almásy comes out of the cave, carrying the bundle of Katharine in his
arms, wrapped in the silks of her parachute."|stage direction
1681|KATHARINE (O/S)|"...I know you will come and carry me
out into the palace of winds, the rumors
of water... That's all I've wanted -
to walk in such a place with you, with
friends, on earth without maps."|speech

THE PLANE growls and complains into the air.
212	INT.    TIGER MOTH.    DAY.
INSIDE THE COCKPIT:  THE COUPLE AS AT THE FRONT OF THE FILM.  Almásy
obliterated by goggles and helmet.  Katharine behind him, slumped
forwards as if sleeping.
Almásy banks across the plateau of the Gilf Kebir and glances down.  In
a ravine is a sudden OASIS OF WHITE ACACIAS.  He is mesmerized.
And then it's gone and he passes into the earth without maps - the
desert - as it stretches out for mile after mile."|stage direction
1683|KATHARINE (O/S)|"The lamp's gone out and I'm writing
in the darkness..."|speech
1684||"Almásy, the English Patient, begins to sing - Szerelem, Szerelem -
until that also fades and is replaced by the woman's tender lament
heard at the beginning of the film, singing for all that has been lost.
The sound of gun fire...
