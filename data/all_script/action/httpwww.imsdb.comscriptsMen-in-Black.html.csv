2||"A million stars wink in the night desert sky. Down here on earth, an
insect, one of those big, beautiful, multicolored four-winged jobs, glides
effortlessly on the breeze, wafting along through the crisp Texas air.
The insect dips, it banks, it does loop-the-loops -- and then SPLATS
unceremoniously against the windshield of a white van that's tearing down
the road."|stage direction

smearing the remains all over."|stage direction
5|DRIVER|Goddamn bugs.|speech
6||"He squirts some wiper fluid onto the glass, which clears it up a bit, but
now he sees something worse up ahead. It's a grouping of headlights, eight
of them, all pointed at him, sealing off the road.
He bites his lip and calls over his shoulder, to the back of the van. He
speaks in Spanish, which is subtitled."|stage direction

9||"The van slows to a stop in front of the parked cars, all government-issue
four doors with ""INS"" stenciled on the sides. Seven or eight INS AGENTS
stand in front of the cars imposingly. Their apparent leader steps forward
and comes to the window.
The DRIVER rolls it down. AGENT JANUS, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, also
government issue, looks at him and sighs."|stage direction
10|AGENT JANUS|"Well. Nick the Dick. What a surprise. Where
you comin' from?"|speech
11|DRIVER|I was fishing in Cuernavaca.|speech

look at your catch?"|speech
13||"AT THE BACK OF THE VAN,
the Agents fling open the rear doors, revealing a DOZEN FRIGHTENED

20||"He stops in the middle of his sentence, as another car is approaching,
fast, its engine WHINING as it barrels down the road toward them. Several
Agents pull their weapons.
The new car pulls a hard right, goes off the road, spins around the INS
cars, and SQUEALS to a sideways halt, silhouetted in front of their
headlights. It's a boxy, black 1986 Ford LTD.
TWO MEN get out, dressed in plain black suits, crisp white shirts, simple
black ties, shiny black shoes. KAY, fiftyish, is the apotheosis of
world-weary; his partner, DEE, mid-sixties, is just weary. They approach
the INS agents."|stage direction

van. The others pile into the rear and they tear out of there."|stage direction

off, covering him. Kay has an arm draped around the man's shoulders."|stage direction

part of town, amigo. In fact, I'll bet
dollars to pesos that you're not --"|speech

the man's clothes."|stage direction
66|KAY (CONT'D)|-- from anywhere near here.|speech
67||"The man's clothes fall to the ground, revealing what he really is
underneath -- A SCALY SPACE BASTARD, about four-and-a-half feet tall, with
a snouth, snail-like tentacles, and independently moving eyes on stalks at
the top of his head.
The only part of his camouflage not crumpled to the ground is the
humanesque ""head,"" which he still lamely holds in one of his hands. It's
propped up by a stick, like a puppet, and it continues to make expressions
as he holds it."|stage direction
68|KAY (CONT'D)|Mikey?! When did they let you out of jail?|speech

76|KAY|"Okay, that's enough. Hand me your head and
put up your arms."|speech
77||"From behind Mikey, they hear a terrified GASP.
Kay and Dee both look over quickly. One of the alien's eyes, on a tall
stalk, whips around too. All three of them see AGENT JANUS, standing just
over the rise, staring in frozen amazement."|stage direction
78|KAY (CONT'D)|Ah, shit.|speech
79||"Agent Janus SCREAMS. Mikey rips free of the rest of the ""Mexican""
disguise, knocks Dee out of the way, and takes off straight at Janus,

out of his hand as he hit the ground."|stage direction
82|KAY (CONT'D)|Dee, for Christ's --|speech
83||"Mikey keeps moving, covering the last few yards to Janus quickly. He steps
on a rock, launches himself into the air, his dripping jaws cranked wide
open --
-- there is a SIZZLING sound, a brilliant white flash --
-- and Mikey ERUPTS in a geyser of blue goo that splatters all over the
ground, the trees, and Agent Janus' face. Behind where Mikey was, Kay
stands, smoking weapon in hand."|stage direction

92|KAY|"Human, I know. Oops. Got some entrails on
you."|speech
93||"He takes out a handkerchief and wipes off the Agent's face. As he does,
Janus looks back to where Mikey blew up. Then at Kay. And then up at the
stars.
The other INS Agents burst over the rise, SHOUTING questions."|stage direction
94|KAY|"Okay, everybody, situation's under control,
calm down. If you'll just give me your
attention for a moment I'll tell you what
happened."|speech
95||"From over the rise, car engines WHINE in the distance and headlights start
to flash around them. Kay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tubular
metallic device the size of a pocket recorder. He checks his watch,
figures in his head, then dials an electronic counter on the side of the
device up to ""08."""|stage direction
96|KAY (CONT'D)|"This is called a ""neuralyzer."" A gift from
some friends from out of town. The red eye
here isolates and measures the electronic
impulses in your brain. More specifically,
the ones for memory."|speech
97||"Behind him, six more MEN IN BLACK, all wearing black suits and sunglasses,
come over the hill. Kay barks a few orders to them."|stage direction

102|KAY|"Really? I'm just a figment of your
imagination."|speech
103||"He holds up the neuralyzer. The Agents peer closely at it.  Kay reaches
into his pocket, puts on his own black sunglasses --
-- and pushes a button on the side of the neuralyzer.  A BLINDING FLASH a
tenth of a second long sears the Agents' eyeballs. They stare blankly."|stage direction
104|KAY (CONT'D)|God, we're a gullible breed.|speech
105||"Behind him, TONGUES OF FIRE blast from a flame thrower held by one of the
Men in Black. Kay looks back at the INS Agents, who are just coming
around, as if awakening from a concussion."|stage direction
106|KAY (CONT'D)|"I mean it, fellas, you are lucky to be
alive after a blast like that."|speech
107||The Agents look around, confused.|stage direction
108|AGENT JANUS|What -- blast?|speech
109||"Kay gestures behind him, where the Men in Black are now using fire
extinguishers to douse the flames they themselves started."|stage direction
110|KAY|"Underground gas vein, genius. You guys need
to exercise more caution before discharging
your firearms."|speech
111||He jabs a finger into Janus' chest.|stage direction
112|KAY (CONT'D)|Especially you.|speech

DOWN TO...
A pair of feet running. They belong to a man we will know as the
PERPETRATOR. As we track with him, he SPEEDS UP and OUT OF FRAME.
A new set of feet come into frame. These belong to JAMES EDWARDS, a NYC
COP in undercover street clothes. In the BACKGROUND, about ten feet
behind, are two other cops, trying to keep up.
Edwards is a lot faster, though. He pulls out his badge that hangs from a
chain under his shirt."|stage direction

132||"The Cop fumbles in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes.
TRACK WITH EDWARDS AND THE PERP
As they run down the bridge that traverses Park Avenue in the low Forties.
The Perp veers to the left and, seemingly oblivious to the fact that it's
a thirty-foot drop, he hurdles the guard rail, and drops to Forty-first
Street below.
EDWARDS is surprised by this maneuver, but doesn't waste a second. He,
too, hurdles the guard rail and lands on..."|stage direction

134||"A DOUBLE-DECKER BUS, one of those cheesy sightseers that hold up midtown
traffic. The bus, of course, is completely filled with JAPANESE TOURISTS,

EDWARDS pushes through the crowd..."|stage direction
135|EDWARDS|"Grand Central Station off to your left,
folks..."|speech
136||"With the bus still moving, he scrambles down the circular stairs and runs
out through the side door.
He spots the Perp, sailing east on Forty-first Street."|stage direction
137|EDWARDS|"Dammit, man, you're making me sweat up my
gear!"|speech

frame, leaning off the back of the truck."|stage direction

The Perp, now straddled by Edwards, is terrified."|stage direction

144|EDWARDS|"And when he gets here, I'll kick his ass
too."|speech
145||"Edwards is about to slap the cuffs on him, when the Perp blinks. Nothing
unusual about that, but then another set of translucent, milky white
eyelids, underneath his regular eyelids, blinks also.
Edwards is thrown for a moment, which is all the time the Perp needs to
pull out...
His WEAPON, which is the strangest looking gun you've ever seen. Reacting
quickly, Edwards bats it out of the Perp's hand.
THE WEAPON smashes into the stone wall surrounding Central Park and
SHATTERS into a million pieces."|stage direction
146|EDWARDS|What the...|speech
147||"WHOMP! The Perp kicks him in the nuts, then scrambles to his feet and
takes off again. Edwards staggers after him, in pain.
The Perp leaps over a moving car, towards the GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM. Edwards
tries to follow, but a bus pulls in front of him. After it passes, the
Perp is gone."|stage direction
148||EXT. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM -- NIGHT|location
149||"Edwards runs over to the Museum, leans over the wall that surrounds it,
and in the next instant...
The Perp flies past him, having leapt from twenty feet down to the top of
the Guggenheim. He scrambles up and over the ledge.
Edward reacts. He runs to the front door of the Museum, shoots it open and
runs inside.
He runs from the rotunda up the grand ramp of the Guggenheim."|stage direction
150||EXT. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM -- ROOF -- NIGHT|location
151||"On the roof, the PERP reaches the top, climbs over the edge, and CRUNCHES
to the gravel surface. He leaps to his feet and races over to a door. It's
locked.
He tugs on another. It's locked too. He pulls on a third. It swings open --
-- revealing EDWARDS on the other side, breathing hard. He aims his weapon
at the Perp."|stage direction
152|EDWARDS|Wassup?|speech

the roof."|stage direction

and now he'll kill me too!"|speech
155|EDWARDS|Stop!|speech

end."|speech

to fall over. The Perp blinks."|stage direction

across from him."|stage direction

eyelids. You mean blinked with both eyes?"|speech

again with another completely different set."|speech
165|SERGEANT|Sort of a low beam, high beam.|speech
166|INSPECTOR|"Was that before or after he drew the weapon
which you claim evaporated into a million
pieces?"|speech
167|EDWARDS|After, sir.|speech
168|INSPECTOR|"And why do you suppose none of the other
officers saw either of these two events?"|speech
169|EDWARDS|"'Cause some of the other officers are a
little soggy in the midsection. And they

steps forward, to face Rosenberg, who sets the ornate box on the table.
Immediately, ROSENBERG'S CAT jumps on top of it.
Rosenberg and the Arquillian stare at each other for a long moment --

it, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown. They hold on, long and hard, and
both seemed choked with emotion.

seems to be contained in one tiny ball --
