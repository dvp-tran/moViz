flowers, dear. I'll be back in
twenty minutes. It's tulip season
today. I'm so happy."|speech
5||"And now she turns and faces the hallway... her sweetness
dissolves in a flash... replaced by repulsion and that
quickly she has reversed herself and re-entered her
apartment... closing the door as we consider her vacated.
POV - MELVIN UDALL
in the hallway... Well past 50... unliked, unloved,
unsettling. A huge pain in the ass to everyone he's ever
met. Right now all his considerable talent and strength
is totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the
elevator door he holds open."|stage direction

10|unknown|"Wanna go for a ride? Okay,
sweetie?"|speech
11||"The dog lifts his leg at the precise moment Melvin lunges
and picks him up with a decisive heft -- so that dog
urine squirts the hall wall for a second or two. The DOG
sensing a kindred spirit starts to GROWL and BARK."|stage direction

(a malevolent tone)"|location
13|unknown|"You've pissed your last floor, you
dog-eared monkey."|speech

garbage chute."|stage direction
15||MELVIN|location
16|unknown|"I'll bet you wish you were some
sort of real dog now, huh? Don't
worry...  this is New York. If you
can make it here, you can make it
anywhere, you know? You ugly,
smelly fuck."|speech
17||"And with that, he stuffs him in the garbage chute and
lets go. We hear a FADING SERIES of PLEADING ""ANOOOOS""
from the DOG fade to nothingness... as another apartment
door opens emitting the loud sounds of a PARTY and SIMON
NYE, early 30s. Simon has been born and raised with
Gothic horror and it's strange that what that stew of
trauma has produced is a gifted, decent man."|stage direction

Handyman... JACKIE, Frank's junior partner, barking a
laugh at the Party Goer -- VERDELL BARKING some love. As
the others greet Simon, Jackie directs the group inside.
Jackie lingers, looking on affectionately as Simon picks
some awful, sticky gunk from the dog's body... he puts
Verdell down to reach for his wallet -- the tiny DOG YAPS
in protest."|stage direction

writes."|stage direction
84|MELVIN|"'Somewhat in the dark, she had
confessed and he had forgiven.
This is what you live for, he
said. Two heads on a pillow where
there is only the safety of being

101|SIMON|I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.|speech

close the door when Simon has another burst of bravery."|stage direction

phone off and put a little piece
of cardboard in the ringer so no
one can just buzz me from d..."|speech
110|MELVIN|"Well, I work all the time. So
never, never again interrupt me.
Okay? I mean, never. Not 30
years from now... not if there's
fire. Not even if you hear a thud
from inside my home and a week
later there's a smell from in
there that can only come from a
decaying body and you have to hold
a hanky against your face because
the stench is so thick you think
you're going to faint even then
don't come knocking or, if it's
election night and you're excited
and want to celebrate because some
fudge-packer you dated has been
elected the first queer President
of the United States... and he's
going to put you up in Camp David
and you just want to share the
moment with someone...  don't knock
...  not on this door. Not for
anything. Got me. Sweetheart?"|speech
111|SIMON|"Yes. It's not a subtle point
you're making."|speech
112|MELVIN|Okay, then.|speech
113||Melvin enters his apartment and slams the door shut.|stage direction
114|SIMON|"So the theory of confrontations is
that now he'll think twice before
messing with me?"|speech
115||Frank smiles affectionately. Simon turns serious.|stage direction
116|SIMON|"He's genuinely upsetting, isn't
he?"|speech
117|FRANK|"Won't worry about it. You go
ahead."|speech
118||"Frank waits till Simon EXITS SCENE and then knocks loudly
on Melvin's door. There is a sharp change in his demeanor."|stage direction
119|MELVIN (O.S.)|"Oh, I'm pissed!! Now I am really
pissed!!!"|speech
120||"Frank waits patiently as Melvin jerks his door back open.

forward...  Melvin is scared. Operating on survival mode."|stage direction
121|MELVIN|No touch. No touch. No touch.|speech
122|FRANK|"You may think you can intimidate
the whole world with your
attitude, but I grew up in Hell.
My grandmother had more attitude.
You don't intimidate me."|speech

black."|speech
127|FRANK|"Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like
him enough to batter you
unrecognizable if you verbally
abuse him or so much as touch his
dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try
and think how you can make this up
to him."|speech

dealer."|speech
130||(beat)|location
131|FRANK|Have a nice day. Party!|speech

his shirt as he steps out into the hall. Frank smiles as
he re-enters the other apartment. Melvin appears
impressed."|stage direction

134||"A crowded and dirty street and here comes Melvin. His
walk is brisk -- an animal wanting to pass through the
danger without giving off the scent of its mounting fear.
At times he places his palms together and extends his
arms cutting a path through people. We will be very
pointed in the fact that he avoids stepping on cracks.
CLOSER ON MELVIN
His eyes focused on the terrain."|stage direction

155|CAROL|"I owe you. I told you today...
them's the rules. Oh, excuse me,
Melvin."|speech

you have time to get ready for the
date."|speech
162|CAROL|"""Ready"" is not my problem."|speech
163||"She barks a mirthless though hearty laugh. If we could
read Melvin which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the
date talk. To Carol he is as harmless as furniture."|stage direction
164||(to Melvin)|location
165|CAROL|"Go sit down. You know you're not
allowed back here...  Spencer's
more excited about it than I am...

act like this again you're barred
for life. I'm gonna miss the
excitement, but I'll handle it."|speech
181||"There is in Carol's attitude toward Melvin some
ingredient of self-satisfaction -- that she is the only
one in the place who can handle him. She starts to clear
the table."|stage direction
182|MELVIN|"The table's fine if it had some
cholesterol on it. Two sausages,
six bacon strips, fries, three
eggs over easy and coffee."|speech

You will. It sure sounds like
your son will."|speech

193||"She is underneath a YOUNGER, cuter MAN on the living room
sofa. He is expertly into foreplay. She begins to make
noises as she responds...  each time startling herself
with her own noise and trying to reign it in.
She's two women here -- one speeding the pleasure highway
-- the other -- functional mom so blown away by the
emergence of this sexy self that she laughs. The Young
Man stops and looks at her."|stage direction

No. I'm sorry if I'm a goof."|speech
200||"And so with earnestness and caring, she has transformed
the sex into something more intimate -- and, talk about
egg in your beer, hotter. Things are getting wild when

smoke."|speech

squeezes her breast -- then he stops and looks at his
hand. She looks down and sees a bit of throw-up he
picked up while feeling her and then notices him looking
at her with extreme distaste...  She barks a laugh to
cover her embarrassment but speaks the truth."|stage direction
