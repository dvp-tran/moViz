Mikey is about to check farther, when out of nowhere:
Storm lashes out with a savage punch to the face. The
blow is so devastating it knocks Mikey's feet out from
under him so that he topples face-forward into Storm's
arms, out cold. Storm soundlessly lowers the lookout to
the ground.
Storm shakes a sore hand and notices it's cut. Kneeling
down to the outstretched heap, he finds the cause of his
injury -- one of Mikey's teeth wiggles freely in his

Felicia is now hysterically screaming -- but not for long --
as she is mortally wounded. We are sure Storm will
collapse and this horror will be over, but Storm rushes
the remaining assailant, and tilting his body sideways as
he enters, he avoids one more ferocious BLAST.
The momentum of Storm's quick spin catches the assailant
perfectly, and like a fast spinning top slammed against
another, Storm has the puppet by the strings. He clamps
down with his left and only good hand on the assailant's
right hand, and uses it against the gun as a tool for
more torque. Spinning him around until he is at the peak
of his circle, Storm with all his might spins his whole
body in the opposite direction quickly, using the whipping
effect of his shoulder and hip to snap the assailant's
wrist and flip him violently.
There is a LOUD CRACK and   scream as he lands on his head

He again uses the power of the attacker's momentum and as
soon as his cue goes down, so does Storm's, onto the back
of Jones's skull with so much force we hear the NECK SNAP
at the same time the cue splinters in half! Storm is
left with the jagged tip of the skinny end.
Dunne, knowing he'll never make it in time to the couch
at the rear of the room, lunges at Storm with a butcher
knife he seizes from a tray of cold cuts on a side table.
Storm traps the knife, and quickly guides it into Dunne's
midsection. With the other hand he  raises the sharpened
end of the pool stick and slams it down Dunne's throat
via the windpipe!"|stage direction

Anticipation of death is worse than death itself.
HOLLAND
A faint smile comes to his face with great confidence.
As he backs out of the toilet, he pulls his pistol from
his shoulder holster, cocking it. He cautiously exits.
TRACKING
Holland as he   moves toward the sporting room   and his
support team.    He enters the area of carnage   and the smug
confidence on   his face starts to change to a   slight worry.
He then starts   carefully making his way back   to the indoor

WALL BEHIND HOLLAND
A Louis XIII portrait -- where a silver dollar-sized group
of holes has just appeared, two inches above Holland's
head. They are both out of ammo.
STORM'S POV
Holland picks up a fireplace poker. He's swinging like
maniac and we hear the sound of the poker SLASHING the
AIR.
But he gets too close to Storm, who snatches the poker
away from him.
They are like two vicious cats whirling. We see Holland
gasping in agony and hear the sound of BONES BREAKING.
Storm then begins the search for Trent. He casually
strolls through the house calling as if he's playing hide
and seek with a childhood friend."|stage direction

what. He approaches the master closet as he continues
the taunting melody.

aside -- looking for something that's probably not there.

Storm reaches to shove it aside when, with shocking and
deafening suddenness: a SHOTGUN BLAST erupts point-blank
... shredding $10,000 worth of suit jackets and barely
missing Storm's head. Instantly a figure leaps out. Storm
gently disarms him, and the two men are for a moment frozen
eye to eye.
STORM AND TRENT
Storm seems to drift off somewhere far away, and then
violently slams Trent up against the wall, pinning his
chest with the left hand. Storm takes the sawed-off
shotgun by the handle and punches the barrel straight
into Trent's mouth. The barrel simply goes through the
teeth and in his mouth. It appears Storm has made up his
mind about what to do. Trent's eyes bug out of his head.
Storm now takes Trent by the hair and leads him through
the house, shotgun still in his mouth."|stage direction

penitentiary ..."|speech

whether you could remain anal

to go out of his mind. About this time in their journey
through the house, Storm has stopped before Holland's
mangled and lifeless body. If you think Trent was scared
before, you should see him now.
Storm curiously turns his back on Trent for a moment, to
pick up handcuffs off the floor. Trent sees his last
chance.
Trent seizes the poker and does his most mighty Babe Ruth
impression. Just as Storm stands up, the poker comes
flying. It looks like Storm is dead but somehow he steps
inside the arc and does shihonage, which disarms Trent
and flips him backwards head-first into the fire.
Trent's neck is impaled by one of the decorative iron
arrows of the fireplace. He is stuck -- struggling to
free himself from the arrow as his head catches fire ...
a fate somewhat worse than prison."|stage direction

see a procession of marching men, all  wearing kilts, and
all the accoutrements of traditional  Scottish garb. In
the front, several paces ahead of the  neatly marching
lines of men, is a single BAGPIPER.   Behind all of them
is a hearse, being nobly escorted by  mounted police.
FULL SHOT
Now we see them fully: the colors, the feeling, the emotion
of caring men marching in the funeral parade of a fallen
comrade.
CAMERA PAN'S OVER to reveal a section of mourners -- mostly
police but with some civilians. The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER
and PANS TO the front row, where we see Storm in full
police regalia, a medal of valor around his neck. Andy
and Sonny are standing near at sober attention.
The procession stops and the lone bagpiper continues to
play the dirge as he walks up and takes his position on a
section of lawn. The pallbearers remove the flag from
the casket and present it to the Chief of Police, who now
slowly approaches the group of mourners and stops directly
in front of Sonny Storm. He presents the flag and salutes
Sonny. The lone bagpiper stops and an officer on TRUMPET
begins playing ""Taps."" The coffin is slowly lowered.

Finally: the film that Storm shot that night seven years
ago on the wharf. Spliced with the audiotape -- with
subtitles including each speaker's name to make every
word and identity clear. We see:
The two Shadow Men step from the station wagon. The
""pushed"" film clearly reveals them to be Trent and Holland.
