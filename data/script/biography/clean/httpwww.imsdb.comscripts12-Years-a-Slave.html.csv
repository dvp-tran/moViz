1||1 INT. TOWNHOUSE/STUDY - DAY 1|location||
2|unknown|"-EARLY APRIL, 1841-
We are close on a PAIR OF BLACK HANDS as they open A
FINELY WRAPPED PACKET OF VIOLIN STRINGS.
WE CUT TO the hands stringing a VIOLIN. It's not a high
end piece, but it is quite nice.
WE CUT TO a wide shot of the study. Sitting in a chair
with violin in hand is SOLOMON NORTHUP; a man in his late
twenties. Everything about Solomon, his mien and manner,
is distinguished. But he, too, seems a hardy individual.
Someone who has known manual labor in his time.
Solomon begins to lightly play his violin, as if testing
the strings, their tuning. Satisfied, Solomon begins to
play vigorously. As he does, we make a HARD CUT TO:"|speech|unknown|M
3||INT. HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - EVENING|location||
4|unknown|"We come in on a lively affair. A dinner party is being
thrown within the confines of a fairly stately house. In
attendance are EIGHT COUPLES. All are WHITE and all are
FAIRLY YOUNG, in their early twenties. The men and women
are dressed in very fine attire. We should get the sense
that for the most part they are people of means.
The furniture has been set aside in the living room. At
the moment the couples are engaged in the dancing of a
REEL.
The music they are dancing to is being played by Solomon,
having cut directly from the tune he was previously
playing. He plays with a light determination, and in no
way seems possessed with empty servitude.
Solomon concludes the reel, and the dancers break into
enthusiastic applause, which is followed by personal
thanks and congratulations from all. It should be clear
that despite their respective races there is much
admiration and appreciation for Solomon's abilities."|speech|unknown|M
5||INT. NORTHUP HOUSE/BEDROOM - MORNING|location||
6|unknown|"It is a Saturday morning. Clad in her finest attire is
ANNE; Solomon's wife, a few years younger than he. We
see also the Northup children: MARGARET who is eight, and
ALONZO who is five. They are handsome, and well groomed
kids. Anne straightens up the children. She finishes,"|speech|unknown|M

8||3 CONTINUED: 3|stage direction||
9|(CONTINUED)|"she rises up and stands behind them, almost as if
preparing to pose for a portrait.
They all wait a moment, then Solomon enters the foyer.
He stands and looks admiringly at his family. ADMIRINGLY
stressed. It isn't that he doesn't have love for them,
he does as well. But in the moment, he truly admires his
greatest accomplishment: a family that is healthy and
well and provided for. He goes to his children, and
hands each a coin, then goes to Anne. Gives her a kiss
on the cheek. The children giggle at the sight."|speech|unknown|M
10||EXT. STREET - DAY|location||
11|(CONTINUED)|"Solomon and his family are out walking along the streets
and groves of Saratoga.
The streets are well populated this morning with many
people out strolling. Most are WHITE, but there are
BLACKS as well. They are FREED BLACKS who mingle fairly
easily - though not always completely - with the whites.
We see, too, a few BLACK SLAVES who travel with their
WHITE MASTERS. These pairings are largely from the south
and - despite the fact the blacks are slaves - they are
not physically downtrodden, not field hands. They are
well dressed and ""leading apparently an easy life"" -
comparatively speaking - as they trail their masters.
As they walk, Solomon and his family arrive to an
intersection well-worn and muddied from horse and cart
traffic. Solomon and his children easily jump across the
muck. Anne stands at the lip of the puddle, calls for
Solomon to help her across."|speech|unknown|M
12|ANNE|"Solomon...
Solomon, turning back to his wife with a broad smile
waving her forward:"|speech|ANNE|F
13|SOLOMON|"Come, Anne. Jump.
The children, now smiling as well, egg their mother on."|speech|SOLOMON|M
14|ALONZO MARGARET|"Jump. You can make it. I've done it. You can make
it."|speech|ALONZO MARGARET|?
15|ANNE|"I will not ruin my dress. Catch
me!
Solomon moves close, holds out his arms. Yet, there's
still just a bit of mischievousness in his eyes. Anne
gives her husband a lightly stern look to which Solomon
replies."|speech|ANNE|F
16||3.|location||
17|SOLOMON|I will catch you, Anne.|speech|SOLOMON|M
18|(BEAT)|"I will.
Again, lightly stern:"|speech||
19|ANNE|"You will.
And with that Anne takes the leap. Solomon catches her,
swings her around grandly and sets her down lightly to
the delighted applause of the children. That done,
Solomon takes Anne's hand and leads her on.
As Solomon and his family make their way, among the
slaves on the street, we see one in particular; JASPER.
As he trails his MASTER he can't help but note Solomon
and his family as they enter A STORE. His intrigue of
this most handsome and harmonious group should be
obvious.
With his Master occupied, Jasper moves slyly toward the
STORE. Frozen on the spot, Jasper looks on admiringly.
Suddenly a voice barks out-
A VOICE (O.S.)
Jasper! Come on!"|speech|ANNE|F

Using a long pole, Mr. Parker fetches down a CARRY ALL

29|PARKER|"Something to suit your style, but
sturdy enough for the forty miles

Handing the Bag to Anne, she is immediately taken by it."|speech|PARKER|F

31|"SOLOMON
(CAUTIOUSLY)"|At what price?|speech|SOLOMON|M
32|ANNE|"We will take it. Children, come
see what your father has just
purchased for me.
As the children run over - chattering excitedly about the
new gift - they RUN PAST JASPER who has quietly entered
the store.
At the checkout counter sits a portrait of WILLIAM HENRY
HARRISON, the edges draped in black crepe. Before the
book sits a LEDGER. Mr. Parker asks of Solomon:"|speech|ANNE|F
33|PARKER|"If you would sign our condolence
book. My hope is to find a way to
forward it to the Widow Harrison.

complexion and light eyes. Both are finely, if perhaps a
bit garishly, dressed. Hamilton, as Solomon describes
him, slightly effeminate.

money was collected."|speech|BROWN|M

You were promised opportunity, and
you were given none."|speech|HAMILTON|M

circumstances. He finds himself in a nearly lightless
room about twelve feet square with walls of solid
masonry. There is a thick and well-locked door, a small
window covered with iron bars and a shutter. The only
furniture is a wood stool and an old fashioned, dirty box
stove. As Solomon rises he sees that his HANDS are
CUFFED - the chain running to a bolt in the ground - and
his LEGS IN IRONS. At first Solomon is incredulous. But
that emotion is replaced first by fury and then panic.
He begins to pull on the chains, fight against them. He
does so with increasing desperation. Solomon flails
about, the sounds of the steel chains whipping and
beating against the masonry. He grunts and screams
without regard as the cuffs and irons bite into his
flesh, but he cannot pull himself free.
After several minutes of intense effort, Solomon tires,
slows, then finally he collapses. And in this collapsed

are held in all types of shackles, from simple chains to
elaborate bindings, to neck collars that are spiked.

The weight of defeat should hang very heavily with both
men. Nothing more to do, nothing more to say BASS TAKES
SOLOMON'S HAND, GRIPS IT FIRMLY, BUT LOW AND
SURREPTITIOUSLY knowing full well he cannot be seen
making contact with a slave. But in the strength of
their collective grip, in the emotion in which they hold
each other's eyes, we should be able to easily see how
greatly Bass wanted to be able to help Solomon. Equally,
we can see the depth of regard Solomon has for Bass. The
moment is made all the more powerful by the fact neither
man can openly speak his regret or thanks. A moment
longer, and then Bass releases his grip and makes his
way marching toward the gazebo, pointing instructions.
Solomon is left, markers in hand, alone."|speech|PEOPLE--SOLOMON|?

1400|OMIT|"Solomon sits on a secluded part of the road, fiddle in
hand. He stares across the expanse. His eyes fixed on
something that is a million miles away.
Slowly Solomon tunes his fiddle, turning the tuning peg
tighter and tighter. As the strings are taut, the sound
is almost unbearable as Solomon tightens bit by bit, as
if bones are being cracked one by one. Just beyond the
breaking point of sound, there is a snap.
He then repeats the action.
Solomon holds the neck of the violin. Sliding his thumb
and forefinger down the neck, he methodically cracks it
at the base. He carefully snaps the neck and removes it
from the body, then snaps it in two, placing it on the
ground.
He then starts on the body. Heaving it on the ground, it
falls apart. Methodically he breaks the violin into small
bits - silencing the instrument with a hushed display of
violence, rather than aggressive. Seems almost to be, in
an odd way, respectful."|speech|OMIT|?

aged significantly since then, stands nervously,

tear falls from his cheek, but this is not the way he
wants his family to see him. He gathers himself, and
looks to his right. There stands Mr. Parker. He places
