bustling park and then swoops us into the lavish gardens.
There, a ten-year-old girl plays in the lush grass; she puts
the finishing touches to a miniature version of the large
park she sits in - benches made from twigs, trees from
flowers, picnic cups from acorns - and gives a satisfied nod.
She wraps her arms tightly around her chest, lifts her face
to the sky, a half-smile threatening to break across her
concentrated face. This is the young P.L. TRAVERS (whom we
will also know as GINTY.)"|stage direction|||

stiff and steely determination.
Her office is a canvas of a life well travelled. Buddha
smiles from every corner, framed poetry and letters adorn the
walls alongside pictures of Pamela throughout the years with
men we will not come to know and everywhere, china hens sit
on shelves, their wings clasped to their chests, brooding.
Despite the multitude of objects, the room is peaceful,
white.
Downstairs the doorbell rings.
Pamela closes her eyes, breathes.
It rings again, Pamela shakes her head, tuts. She stands up,
smooths down her skirt with flat palms. Breathes."|stage direction|||
