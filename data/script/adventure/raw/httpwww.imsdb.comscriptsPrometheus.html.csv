EXT. EARTH - DAY (12,000 B.C.)"|location
2||"The world turns below us, vast and slow.
A RUMBLE. A shadow sweeps over the land. We move with the
shadow. We cast the shadow.
Landscapes slide by. Reduced by altitude to abstractions:
river deltas, forests and flood plains. A raw natural world.
No trace of civilization.
The shadow glides over mountains and glaciers. Across an
ocean and a pale beach. Over lowland plain at the foot of a
VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN it stops."|stage direction
3||EXT. LOWLAND PLAIN - DAY|location
4||"THREE FIGURES walk out of the shadow.
They are men - and yet not men. Their skin is snow-white.
Their features heavy and classical - as if Rodin's Thinker
had risen from his seat. Their smooth heads are earless and
hairless. Their glittering eyes entirely black.
Against the stark land their height is impossible to judge.
They are ENGINEERS.
Two of them are cloaked in dark robes of strange design.
The third is naked.
One of the cloaked Engineers opens a featureless black box:
inside lies a cake of dark, sticky material.
The naked one lifts the dark cake with ceremonial slowness.
It hums and buzzes. Foams into iridescent spheres. He raises
the seething cake to his mouth like the sacrament.
BLACK SCARABS boil out of the dark material. Swarm over his
lips. Glittering insects that chitter and bite.
Under the swarm his lips melt away. A horrific vision of
teeth, black blood, dissolving bone. They are devouring him."|stage direction

9||THE ENGINEER|location
10||"...spreads his arms. Stands cruciform, nearly headless.
The scarabs swarm his shoulders, his chest. When they reach
his hips, he collapses sideways, toppling majestically like a
felled tree. Engulfed.
The two cloaked Engineers watch impassively.
Behind them, a vast black SHIP hangs in the sky.
As if blown by a great gust of wind, the scarabs disperse in
their millions in all directions. Living DNA on the wing.
Where the sacrificial victim fell, nothing remains."|stage direction
11||EXT. FOREST - DAY|location
12||"A pristine wilderness. The VOLCANIC MOUNTAIN in the distance.
A PRIMITIVE WOMAN stands on a height, staring in amazement:
far off a great dark ship hovers over the plain.
A black scarab lands on the back of her neck. Bites deep.
Injecting its cargo of DNA into her blood."|stage direction
13||FLASH ON:|location
14||"A microscopic invasion. Cells pierced and infused. DNA
strands twining and mating.
CLOSE ON THE WOMAN
Pupils dilating with shock, breath hissing into her lungs.
She slaps the back of her neck. Looks at her hand. The scarab
lies in her palm.
As she watches, it crumbles to dust and blows away."|stage direction

19||"An EXCAVATOR floats into view: a sturdy vehicle equipped with
robotic arms. Bright floodlights beat at the darkness. Inside
the cockpit - a bubble of glass - sits a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
This is DR. JOCELYN WATTS, 32, a precocious scholar of many
disciplines. A scientist accustomed to field work.
The cockpit is sweltering: she wears shorts, boots, a T-shirt
- and still her arms and legs gleam with sweat.
Watts works the controls. The excavator descends toward a
rocky surface. Silt billows up as the excavator approaches:
we're not in space at all, but deep underwater.
The excavator's thrusters are cowled propellers. The ""stars""
are plankton shining in the floodlights."|stage direction
20||INT. EXCAVATOR - CONTINUOUS|location
21||"Watts steers the excavator to a steeply sloping cliff wall. A
sea-trench yawns below her, its depths lost in darkness."|stage direction
22|WATTS|"Moving to survey site B... closing on
object four. The large oblong."|speech

25||EXT. SEA TRENCH - CONTINUOUS|location
26||"Watts carves into the cliff with the excavator's digger arm.
Silt and boulders fall into the yawning trench below. She
brings a water cannon to bear: uses its jet to blast away
loose silt and stones.
The cliff face collapses: a muddy landslide into the deeps.
Watts backs away from the collapse, thrusters whirring to
keep her out of the turbulence. A cloud of silt clears.
In her floodlight beams, the OBELISK stands revealed - its
outlines worn by the ages. Easily thirty feet tall.
Watts stares at the obelisk, stunned. Her voice is husky:"|stage direction
27|WATTS|"Martin. Here.
4."|speech
28||"A second excavator glides out of the dark.
At the controls: PROFESSOR MARTIN HOLLOWAY, 48, visionary
genius and archaeologist. Dark-haired and lean, with the
rangy build of a frontiersman. He's dressed in work trousers
and a T-shirt. Stubbly chin.
He plays his floodlights over the obelisk."|stage direction

45||"A research vessel at anchor on a turquoise sea. Bright sun.
In the distance, a coastline dotted with villas. The horizon
is dominated by the VOLCANIC PEAK - the same peak we saw in
the distance in the prologue.
Aboard the research vessel, cranes lift Watts and Holloway's
excavators out of the sea and onto the deck."|stage direction
46||INT. RESEARCH VESSEL - AFT DECK - DAY|location
47||"Under an awning, PRINTS of the obelisk's faces are stretched
on the deck - fifteen feet long.
Watts and Holloway crawl over the alien text, red markers in
hand. Parsing, translating, calculating.
They're tanned, fit, the wind in their hair. The
Mediterranean coast in the distance. It's an idyllic way to
work. But they're utterly absorbed in the task at hand.
AFT DECK - NIGHT
They're still at it. Lights illuminate the workspace. The
obelisk prints are blanketed with markings and annotations.
Holloway sits at a table. Watts sits on the marked-up prints.
Both working through calculations on electronic slates.
Holloway looks up."|stage direction

Holloway plays with a pen, batting it from hand to hand in
the zero gravity."|stage direction

wood and chrome: the past's vision of the future.
At the rim, the Wheel's rotation supplies gravity. An
elevator door opens. Watts and Holloway step out - Holloway
with a sleek metal folio slung over his shoulder.
The floor is the outer surface of the Wheel: in both
directions it curves upward out of sight.
The walls are all windows: on one side, Earth rotates lazily.
On the other, a wheeling field of stars."|stage direction

Pictures of a younger Holloway in the field: excavating ruins
in Egypt, China, Peru, Greece."|stage direction
106|HOLLOWAY (CONT'D)|"In my studies I discovered a pattern I
couldn't explain. Every eleven hundred
years, sudden advances in agriculture,
tool use, technology. Inventions.
Something caused a great leap forward.
Every eleven centuries. The pattern
holds as far back as our data goes."|speech

to scientific diagrams. Images of a very young and beautiful
Watts in the laboratory."|stage direction
112|WATTS|"I was analyzing historical changes in
human DNA. I found the same pattern.
Every eleven centuries, a pulse of new
information in the genome of the human
race. All over the world. Evolution

it's amazing how the evidence falls
into place."|speech
120||"Photographs flicker through the display: Holloway and Watts
in the field, excavating new sites. Intimately close.
Their finds: columns of writing on stone tablets in Egypt,
China, Cambodia, Peru. Patterns of lines, curves, and dots."|stage direction

We've found it on every continent. And
last year, we found our Rosetta Stone."|speech

145||Weyland jabs a finger at her like she's won a carnival prize.|stage direction
146|WEYLAND|"That's what I'm talking about. You
left out my favorite part. The piece
about Earth. DAVID."|speech
147|DAVID|"For eons, Earth's climate swung from
hothouse to ice age. Explosions of
life, then mass extinctions. But
twelve thousand years ago the swings
stopped. The Holocene Epoch began - a
period of anomalous tranquility. The
rise of civilization began only then."|speech
148||Holloway and Watts stare at DAVID with new appreciation.|stage direction
149|HOLLOWAY|That's right.|speech
150|WATTS|"And that change coincides with a visit
by the Engineers. They didn't just
change us. They changed our world."|speech

and crew, supplies, support. One
condition."|speech
156||"Holloway picks up the contract with the cautious joy of a man
double-checking a lottery ticket. His voice is husky:"|stage direction
157|HOLLOWAY|What's that?|speech
158|WEYLAND|"You get the discovery. Control of the
site. But any technology you find?
Anything at all. That's mine."|speech

(off their silence)
Men ship out as prospectors for one
reason: the percentage. Find a gold
mine or a habitable planet, and you're
set for life.

But this contract says no percentage.
No bounty. Just triple pay. The men

Janek gets the pistol. Flips it in his hand. Fires over his

closes easily over the wounds, sealing its white skin. Its
teeth tighten.
Watts comes out of nowhere in her space suit. Swings a heavy
rifle like a bat with all her strength. A crushing impact
wrenches the Alien's jaws loose. It recoils.
Watts reverses the rifle. Pulls the trigger. A fusillade of
bullets shreds the Alien's head. It collapses, dead.
Watts wrenches her helmet off. Rips a first-aid kit from the

approaching through the wreckage.
She scrambles through a section of ductwork...under a hull
fragment...running and clambering...
The Alien hunts her, cat-and-mouse, among the fragments of
the Magellan: corridors that go nowhere, shattered
compartments. Jetsam.
Her eyes sweep frantically through the stormy night:
searching for a weapon. A hiding place. An answer.

inside. Pulls the lid shut.
The Alien passes by, inches away. She watches it through the

The Alien roots in the wreckage. Finds the rotting Engineer's
head among the shards of its vat. It begins to feed on the
head - GROWING as she watches.
Her suit's oxygen alarm goes off again. 15 MINUTES REMAINING.
The beeping draws the Alien away from its dead meat.
Watts is paralyzed.
The Alien noses closer. Sniffs at the plexiglass case. With
sudden, horrific violence, it lashes out. Sends the freezer
flying. Watts tumbles out. Lurches to her feet and runs.
The Alien follows. Ravening. She leads it a twisting chase
through fragments of burning metal.
Watts trips and falls hard. Picking herself up, she sees

injured arm tucked to its chest. All vengeful fury.
Watts scrambles for the saw. The Alien leaps for her. She
rolls aside - and like a scorpion the Alien impales her thigh
with its spear-tipped tail. Nails her to the ground.
Watts screams in agony. Reaches for the saw, still buzzing on
the ground. Its grip tantalizing inches from her fingertips.
The Alien stoops over her, slavering face inches from her
faceplate. Its hideous jaws open.
With all her strength, Watts pulls against the spike in her
leg. Drags the point of the spear through the dirt.
Excruciating pain. She snarls through her teeth.

IMPALES THE ALIEN'S SKULL.
