1   EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY                                   1
Dark clouds passing overhead.
The bad weather that has hovered over the Eifel mountains, (in
Germany), the past three days is on it's way out..
2   AN EYE FLICKERS - WIDE OPEN - STARING INTENTLY                    2
A pupil dilates and contracts in the light. The eye stares.
Blinks. Thinks. Making evaluations..
3   EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY                                   3
The first rays of sunshine break through. The voices of
international TV commentators in different languages.
COMMENTATORS
...in places the track is still
dangerously wet, but following a
drivers meeting the decision has been
taken. The race is going ahead...
4   INT. FERRARI - DAY                                                4
The eye belongs to a 27 year old Formula 1 RACING DRIVER
wearing a fireproof balaclava...
Highly intelligent, he also happens to be World Champion. His
name is painted on the side of his Ferrari. NIKI LAUDA.
NIKI (V/O)
My grandfather always said history is
cruel and reductive and no matter how
long we live, or how much we achieve -
we are remembered for very little. So
make sure it's the right things.
NIKI stares up at the clouds. His eyelids flicker. Thinking.
Agonizing. Wrestling with an all important decision...
Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry? Should he be
using slicks or wets?
5   EXT. STARTING GRID - DAY                                          5
We widen to find ourselves on the starting grid of a major
Grand Prix. All around us...

5   CONTINUED:                                                       5
Engines scream into life as DRIVERS start their cars. An
OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, ""One
Minute""...
Deafening, angry thunder as engines rev impatiently.
NIKI
This is bullshit. We have no control
over our legacy. We cannot choose what
we are remembered for...
A Ferrari MECHANIC rushes towards NIKI, and shouts in Italian
above the noise, (we see sub-titles)...
MECHANIC
Mass usa slicks. Le vuoi cambiare
anche tu?
(Mass is going on slicks. You
want to change?)
NIKI looks in his wing-mirror back to see a red McLaren, white
helmet, number 12, several rows behind him. A team of
MECHANICS hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres.
NIKI
Otherwise I wouldn't be remembered for
my rivalry with this asshole. And the
1976 season.
NIKI then looks over at the car in pole position beside him.
Another McLaren, but with number 11, and a Union Jack...
NIKI
What about Hunt? Has he changed?
MECHANIC
No, he's going on wets.
The car in pole position: JAMES HUNT, surrounded by TV crews,
mechanics, girlfriends, hangers-on..
The Maclaren team is less than half the size of Ferrari's, but
HUNT makes up for this with magnetism. The rock star of F1.
NIKI's face: a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rival's
glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava,
flirting with several hot-looking GIRLS..
NIKI
I don't know why it became such a big
thing. We were just drivers. Busting
each other's balls. To me this is
perfectly normal. But other people saw
it differently.

NIKI (contíd)
That whatever it was between us went
deeper. And changed us both somehow.
Forever.
NIKI stares, then...
NIKI
Be, allora usiamo anche noi quells da
bagnato.
(Then we go on wets, too.)
The ten-second board is held up.
NIKI pulls down his visor...as he and HUNT's eyes meet for a
split-second, eyes staring...
NIKI selects second gear for the wet track and revs the
engine. The dashboard needle climbs through 8000, 9000, 10000
RPM.
NIKI
Maybe that explains the state of mind
I was in. And why it happened. The
other thing I'm remembered for.
(a beat)
On August 1st, that same year...
CAPTION: ""AUGUST 1st, 1976"".
The STARTER waves the flag. NIKI's foot hits the floor - his
engine screams that deafening, stomach rearranging high-pitch
scream, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd.
NIKI's car is catapaulted forward violently, the wheel-spin
leaving livid black scars on the asphalt..
NIKI gets away first. A good start! But within seconds there's
a McLaren car right behind him, breathing down his neck.
His arch-rival. HUNT.
But as the McLaren roars past, NIKI sees a white helmet.
Number 12. It's not Hunt. It's MASS. On his bald, slick tyres.
NIKI curses under his breath. He screwed up. Made the wrong
decision. Should have gone on slicks. He urgently needs to
change tyres...
NIKI swerves angrily into the pits. Ferrari's pit is right at
one end...
4
6   INT. PITS - DAY                                                   6
Commentary from all the world's TV stations explaining the
crazy, panicked situation as all the DRIVERS come into the
pits to change to dry tyres.
It's chaos. A traffic jam of Formula 1 cars...
The Ferrari team frantically work. Changing NIKI's tyres. Four
men with air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks. The same
Italian MECHANIC appears, `plugs in' his headset to the car..
MECHANIC
Hair visto? Ti aveto detto di usare le
slicks!
(See? I told you to go on
slicks!!)
NIKI
Bullshit. Where's Hunt?"|unknown
1||"There!
NIKI looks up to see the name JAMES HUNT written on the black
helmet roar out of the pits ahead, with new tyres on..."|unknown
2||"C'mon...!!
NIKI screams at the MECHANICS, who are struggling. The airguns
make a high-pitched noise...something's not right.
NIKI
What's GOING ON???
""Thump"", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac, engines scream, and
NIKI exit the pits in pursuit of HUNT. But the delay has cost
him dear...
7   EXT. NUBURGRING - DAY                                             7
Archive TV commentary from the world's race COMMENTATORS
stations informs us of the positions.
MASS leading, HUNT in 3rd, LAUDA in 20th...
8   INT. NIKI'S CAR - DAY                                             8
NIKI gives it everything he's got. Tearing through the gears,
trying to catch JAMES HUNT, breaking as late as he can, engine
screaming.

He flies over the take-off hump between Pflanzgarten and
Swallowtail - passes one car after another. Into 13th place
now. Pulling off outrageous manoeuvres.
NIKI's P.O.V: the world flies past in a blur. The steering
wheel shakes. The car is right on the edge. Cannot be driven
any harder.
NIKI approaches the Streckenteil Adenauer-Brucke section of
the course...turns left at the Bergwerk corner. Crazy speed.
And tight. Too tight. A mistake...
""Thump"", his wheels come into contact with the kerb on the
inside. NIKI tries to counter-steer, but is travelling at 155
mph. The car jerks horribly to the right..
""Crunch"", hits the embankment, then ""Bang"", hits the barrier,
and is thrown across the track..
Fire breaks out in the engine. NIKI's eyes widen in horror,
with another car bearing down upon him...
NIKI
No...!
The oncoming car crashes head-on into our car, ""Crash"", a
sickening, terrifying impact.
The car explodes. Seventy litres of burning high-octane
gasoline, with NIKI strapped inside, unable to undo his
seatbelt. Locked in a blast furnace.
NIKI screams as the flames engulf him. 800 degrees
temperature. Trapped inside his car.
Burning smoke fills his helmet, scarring his lungs...
Pandemonium: commentary in different languages as panicked TV
commentators helplessly describe what's happening..
NIKI's POV: he can just make out the barely recognizable
figures of the other DRIVERS rushing towards NIKI..
Their hands get burnt in the flames as they try unsuccessfully
to undo NIKI's seatbelt..
Fire extinguishers blast at the car. Dry powder extinguishers.
Covering NIKI's helmet. Blurring his vision, as he cries out
in agony, inhaling the powder..
Screaming voices. Panicked reactions. On the side of the car,
the painted name `Niki Lauda' blisters and melts.

Then sound fades. As NIKI blacks out - losing consciousness.
FADE TO BLACK:
Over this: the sound of a ringing phone...
9   INT. HOSPITAL A&E UNIT - (ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY) - DAY           9
We're in a busy hospital A&E unit. Noise. Crowds. A regular
Saturday late afternoon. The phone continues to ring..
Finally, an attractive station NURSE in her 20's, run-off-her-
feet, breathlessly picks up the phone.
NURSE
Emergency...
She covers her ears, straining to hear, listening to what is
being said. Then her expression changes...
NURSE
Okay...standing by!
The NURSE hangs up...then calls out to her NURSE and DOCTOR
colleagues...
NURSE
That was the race-track..! There's
been an accident..! A driver's been
injured and is on his way in..!
Instantly the atmosphere changes. A hive of activity as
DOCTORS and NURSES prepare themselves for a major trauma...
All PATIENTS with minor injuries are cleared out of the way.
The NURSE rings upstairs to the operating theatres and
consultant surgeons, telling them to stand by...
CAPTION: ""EIGHTY-EIGHT RACES EARLIER""
Swing doors open, and a pair of shoeless, BARE FEET walks
through and into the accident and emergency unit.
Camera tilts up a pair of long legs in white racing
overalls...to reveal a tall, good-looking driver, JAMES HUNT,
(mid 20's), tanned, athletic, surfer long blonde hair...
A man about whom a word comes to mind one would rarely use to
describe an Englishman. SEXY.
Blood trickles from his nose, there is bruising to his lip and
the formation (already) of a nasty black eye, but make no
mistake. He rocks. Drop-dead gorgeous..

student. Ashtrays filled with half-smoked joints. Empty beer
cans. A toaster. A kettle. A stereo. A cage containing two
budgerigars.
A mattress on the floor.
Newspapers with headlines about the Dockers Strike, England's
crumbling economy, Rolls Royce being bailed out by the
government - subtle reminders of Britain in transition,
leaving behind its strong, imperial past.

dressed, but already passionately making love..."|location

two weeks before that race in Spain,
we put 20-inch rims on the rear
wheels. We get an extra half second
speed on each lap!! But the Old Man
tells me we can't use those rims, they
make the car too wide. Against the
rules. So we go back to 19-inch rims

NIKI
Thank you. I called this meeting
because as all drivers know the
Nurburgring is a race track from the
Stone Ages. The most stupid, barbaric,
outdated, dangerous, track in the
world. You've all seen the rain which
has been falling this morning. Those
of you with experience know the Ring
needs perfect conditions to be even
remotely acceptable in terms of risk.
As you can see today is anything BUT
perfect, so I called this meeting to
take a vote to cancel the race."|unknown

Yes, I am frightened. Always a little
bit when I race. I accept every time I
get in my car there is 20% chance that
I could die. But not one per cent
more. And today, with the rain the
risk IS more. How dare you accuse me
of lack of courage? Let me remind you.
I have the track record here. I am the
only person in history to do the Ring

to my ADVANTAGE to race here today.
