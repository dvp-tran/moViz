So if you say it, you have to say his
name after it. ""Life is very long:"" TS
Eliot. Absolutely goddamn right.
Wrap around porches, forgotten gardens. Imposing in the
gathering gloom. A single downstairs window glows.
BEVERLY (OS) (CONT'D)
Give the devil his due. Very few
poets could've made it through Eliot's
trial and come out, brilliantined and
double-breasted and Anglican."|unknown|||

12||"BEVERLY WESTON. A craggy, wise and deeply sad Okie.    We take
a long moment, just to study that face.
BEVERLY
Not hard to imagine, faced with
Eliot's first wife, lovely Viv, how
Crane or Berryman might have reacted,
just foot-raced to the nearest bridge;
Olympian Suicidalists.
Stares out the window at the darkening, ominous horizon.
BEVERLY (CONT'D)
Not Eliot: after sufficient years of
ecclesiastical guilt, plop her in the
nearest asylum and get on with it.
He sits   at a cluttered desk, his face damp with sweat. Nurses
a glass   of whiskey, his staggered delivery due more to his
careful   selection of words than drunkenness. He's talking to
someone   we do not yet see.
BEVERLY (CONT'D)
God-a-mighty. You have to admire the
purity of the survivor's instinct.
From somewhere upstairs, a THUD. He looks to the ceiling.
BEVERLY (CONT'D)
Violet. My wife. She takes pills,
sometimes a great many. They affect...
among other things, her equilibrium.
Fortunately, they eliminate her need
for equilibrium..."|unknown|||

We're on her profile, CLOSE, silhouetted against the faint
light from the open bathroom door. She hesitates on the edge
of the bed, getting her bearings. Finds a pack of Winstons,
lights one. Listens to the voices filtering up from below.

HER CLOSELY. Her hair unkempt, her steps unsteady, into --
BEVERLY
The reasons why we partake are
anymore inconsequential.
The hallway, walls lined with photos of long-dead pioneer
ancestors and faded school photographs of three daughters.
BEVERLY (CONT'D)
The facts are: my wife takes pills and
I drink. That's the bargain we've
struck, just one paragraph of our
marriage contract... cruel covenant.
And these facts have over time made
burdensome the maintenance of
traditional American routine.
She makes her way to the stairs starts down.
BEVERLY (CONT'D)
Rather than once more vow abstinence
with my fingers crossed in the queasy
hope of righting our ship, I've chosen
to turn my life over to a Higher Power
and join the ranks of the Hiring
Class.
The light from the study slices across the living room.
BEVERLY (CONT'D)
It's not a decision with which I'm
entirely comfortable. I know how to
launder my dirty undies. Done it all
my life, but I'm finding it's getting
in the way of my drinking.

Sorry about the heat in here. My wife
is cold-blooded and not just in the
metaphorical sense. She does not
believe in air-conditioning... as if
it is a thing to be disbelieved. I
knew your father, you know. Bought
many a watermelon from Mr Youngblood's
fruit stand. He did pass, didn't he??
JOHNNA
Yes, sir.
BEVERLY
May I ask how?
JOHNNA
He had a heart attack. Fell into a
flatbed truck full of wine grapes.
BEVERLY
Wine grapes. In Oklahoma.   I'm sorry.

Yes?

Did you pullish? Did you...Oh, goddamn                *

No...
She stands in the shadows of the living room, confused.
VIOLET
Am I looking through window? A window?
BEVERLY
Can you come here?
She steps into the study, emerging from the darkness into
light to reveal: VIOLET WESTON. Dissipated, dishevelled,
late sixties. She wears pajamas and a much slept-in robe.
VIOLET
Oh.    Hello.
She's staring at a woman sitting in front of Beverly's desk:
JOHNNA. Thirty, Native American, simply dressed.

We keep unusual hours here. Try not
to differentiate between night and
day. You won't be able to keep a
healthy routine.
JOHNNA
I need the work.
BEVERLY
I myself require very little
attention, thrive without it, sort
of a human cactus. My wife has been
diagnosed with a touch of cancer, so
she'll need to be driven to Tulsa for
her final chemotherapy treatments.
You're welcome to use that American-
made behemoth parked out in the drive.
Welcome to make use of anything,
everything, all this garbage we've
acquired, our life's work. Do you
have any questions?
JOHNNA
What kind of cancer?
BEVERLY
My God, I nearly neglected the punch
line: mouth cancer.
JOHNNA
What pills does she take?
BEVERLY
Valium. Vicodin. Darvon, Darvocet.
Percodan, Percocet. Xanax for fun.
OxyContin in a pinch. And of course
Diluadid. I can't forget Diluadid.
Beverly wobbles to his feet, explores his bookshelf.
BEVERLY (CONT'D)
""By night within that ancient house,
Immense, black, damned, anonymous.""

My last refuge, my books: simple
pleasures, like finding wild onions by
the side of a road, or requited love.

Last time I spoke with my father, we
talked about the state of the world,

was always pretty much a whorehouse,
but at least it used to have some
promise. Now it's just a shithole.""
I think maybe he was talking about
something else, something more
specific, personal... this house? This
family? His marriage? Himself?
There was something sad in his voice--
not sad, he always sounded sad --
hopeless. As if it had already
happened. As if whatever was
disappearing had already disappeared.
And no one saw it go. This country,
this experiment, America, this hubris:
what a lament, if no one saw it go.

fire me?

you want to quit. I mean, there's
