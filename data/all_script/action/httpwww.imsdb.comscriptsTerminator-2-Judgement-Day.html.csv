6||"Same spot as the last shot, but now it is a landscape in Hell.  The
cars are stopped in rusted rows, still bumper to bumper.  The
skyline of buildings beyond has been shattered by some
unimaginable force like a row of kicked-down sandcastles.
Wind blows through the desolation, keening with the sound of ten
million dead souls.  It scurries the ashes into drifts, stark
white in the moonlight against the charred rubble.

SLOWLY over seared asphalt where the faint hieroglyphs of hopscotch
lines are still visible.

TILT UP, revealing a humanoid machine holding a massive battle rifle.
It looks like a CHROME SKELETON... a high-tech Death figure.  It is
the endoskeleton of a Series 800 terminator.  Its glowing red eyes
compassionlessly sweep the dead terrain, hunting.
The SOUNDS of ROARING TURBINES.  Searchlights blaze down as a
formation of flying HK (Hunter-Killer) patrol machines passes
overhead.  PAN WITH THEM toward the jagged horizon, beyond which we
see flashes, and hear the distant thunder of a pitched battle in
progress."|stage direction

15||"THE BATTLE.  Human troops is desperate combat with the machines for
possession of the dead Earth.  The humans are a ragtag guerrilla

Centurions, and the humanoid terminators in various forms.

mission: to destroy the leader of the human
Resistance... John Connor.  My son.
The first terminator was programmed to strike at
me, in the year 1984... before John was born.
It failed.
The second was set to strike at John himself,
when he was still a child.  As before, the
Resistance was able to send a lone warrior.  A
protector for John.  It was just a question of
which one of them would reach him first..."|speech

formed by two TRACTOR TRAILERS, parked side by side in the back lot
of an all-night truck stop.  Then...
The strange lightning forms a circular opening in mid-air, and in
the sudden flare of light we see a FIGURE in a SPHERE OF ENERGY.
Then the FRAME WHITES OUT with an explosive THUNDERCLAP!
Through the clearing vapor we see the figure clearly... a naked man.
TERMINATOR has come through.  Physique: massive, perfect.  Face:
devoid of emotion.  Terminator stands and impassively surveys its
surroundings."|stage direction
30||8       INT. TRUCK STOP DINER - NIGHT|location
31||"On a back route to north L.A.  A handful of local TRUCKERS hunch over
chili-sizes, CAT hats pushed back on their heads.  Three BIKERS are
playing a game of pool in the back, their Miller empties lining the
table's rail.  The dive's owner, LLOYD, a fat, aging biker-type in a
soiled apron, stands behind the bar.  Nothing much going on...
Then the front door opens and a big naked guy strolls in -- that
doesn't happen every night.  All eyes simultaneously swivel toward
Terminator.  Its emotionless gaze passes over the customers as it
walks calmly through the room.  Everyone frozen, not sure how to
react."|stage direction
32||8A      TERMINATOR POV.  A digitized electronic scan of the room, overlaid|location

can follow.  In POV we move past the staring truckers, past the
owner and the awestruck WAITRESS, and approach a large nasty-looking
biker puffing on a cigar.  His body is outlined, or ""selected"", and
thousands of estimated measurements appear.  His clothing has been
analyzed and deemed suitable..."|stage direction

35|VOICE (SARAH CONNOR)|"I need your clothes, your boots, and your
motorcycle."|speech
36||"The big biker's eyes narrow.  He takes a long draw on this cigar,
the tip cherry-red hot."|stage direction
37|CIGAR BIKER|You forgot to say please.|speech
38||"He grinds the cigar out on Terminator's chest.  Which produces not
the slight reaction of pain.  Terminator calmly, and without
expression, grabs Cigar by his meaty upper arm...
Cigar screams from the hydraulic grip.
Terminator doesn't see Cigar's friend, behind him, holding his pool
cue by the narrow end like a Louisville Slugger.  The heavy send
whistles in a powerful swing and CRACKS IN TWO across the back of
Terminator's head.
Terminator seems not to notice.  Doesn't even blink.  Without
releasing his grip on Cigar, he snaps his arm straight back and grabs
Pool Cue by the front of his jacket.  Suddenly the heavyset biker
finds himself flying through the nearest window.  CRAASSH!
Terminator hurls Cigar, all 230 pounds of him, clear over the bar,
through the serving window into the kitchen, where he lands on the
big flat GRILL.  We hear a SOUND like SIZZLING BACON as Cigar
screams, flopping jerking.  He rolls off in a smoking heap.
The third biker whips out a knife with a eight-inch blade and slashes
at Terminator's face.
Terminator grabs the arcing blade with his bare hand.  Holding it by
the razor-sharp blade he jerks is from the guy's hand.
Ultra-fast here: He flips it.  Grabs the handle like you're supposed
to hold a knife.  Grabs the biker and slams him face-down over the
bar.  Then brings the knife whistling down, pinning the biker's
shoulder to the bar top with his own steel."|stage direction
39||9       INT. KITCHEN|location
40||"The doors BANGS OPEN and Terminator strides in.
The Mexican cook does a fast fade as Terminator walks toward Cigar,
who is cursing in pain on the floor.
With his deep-fried fingers he struggles to get out the .45 auto
tucked under his leather jacket.  But he can't even hold onto it.
Terminator takes it from him.  Instead of pointing it at him,
Terminator carefully examines weapon, analyzing its caliber and
operating condition.  Terminator never threatens... that's a human
thing.  He just takes.
Cigar senses what he must do when the emotionless eyes come back to
him.  He slides the keys to his bike across the floor to Terminator's
foot.  Then painfully starts getting out of his jacket."|stage direction
41||10      INT. TRUCK STOP|location
42||"Terminator strides from the kitchen, fully clothed now in a black
leather jacket, leather riding pants, and heavy, clean boots.  He
moves toward the moaning biker pinned to the pool table.  Without
slowing his stride he jerks the knife out.  The guy slumps to the
floor, groaning, behind him.
Terminator continues toward the front of the diner, passing Lloyd,
the owner.  At the door, he comes abreast of two truckers who sit
frozen like a snapshot in mid-bite.  One of the truckers finally
nods."|stage direction
43|TRUCKER|Evening...|speech
44||Terminator impassively stares back.  Then moves on out the door.|stage direction
45||11      EXT. TRUCK STOP|location
46||"Terminator walks out, surveying the parked Harleys.  Sticks the .45
in his belt and swings one leg over a massive CUSTOM ELECTRO-GLIDE.
He slips the dagger in his boot and the key in the ignition.  Kicks
over the engine.  It catches with a roar and he slams the heavy iron
into gear with a KLUNK.
Lloyd appears at the diner's door with a sawed-off 10-GAUGE
WINCHESTER LEVER-ACTION SHOTGUN.  He fires into the air and jacks
around round in fast, aiming at Terminator's back."|stage direction
47|LLOYD|"I can't let you take the man's wheels, son.
Now get off or I'll put you down."|speech
48||"Terminator turns and considers by coldly.  He eases the shifter up
into neutral.  Rocks the bike onto its kickstand.  Swings him leg
over and walks calmly toward the guy.
Terminator strides right up to Lloyd, staring straight into the
shotgun's muzzle.  Lloyd starts sweating, trying to decide is he's
going to kill a man in cold blood.  He's still trying to decide when
Terminator's hand blurs out like a striking cobra and is somehow
suddenly holding the shotgun.
Lloyd gapes, knowing he's screwed.  Then...
Terminator reaches toward him.  Oh shit...
And slips the sunglasses out of Lloyd's shirt pocket.  Puts them on.
Strides back to the Harley and roars off in a shower of gravel."|stage direction

50||"Terminator roars down the freeway, heading for L.A.  Cold neon flares
across the chrome of the big bike.  The 10-gauge is jammed through

A TREMENDOUS BLUE-WHITE GLARE suddenly spills out between the columns

around at the source of the light.  He pulls over quickly, in time
to see..."|stage direction
54||13A     The powerfully arcing electrical discharge reaches its peak between|location

standards, lighting up the night, and papers swirl in a blasting
whirlwind."|stage direction
56||13B     The cop climbs from his cruiser as the glow fades.|location
57||"He sees vapor dissipating as he approaches the spot where he saw the
strange light.  He draws his revolver and cautiously moves into the
shadows between the rows of pillars.
A NAKED MAN glides from a shadowed doorway behind the cop.  Nothing
special about him.  Certainly not built like a terminator.  The flash
of light and fact that he is naked are pretty good clues that he
just arrived from the future.  His features are handsome bordering
on severe.  His eyes are gray ice.  Penetrating.  Intelligent.
THE COP spins at a sound.  Too late.  Mr. X is already on him.  The
blow is lighting fast and the cop drops like a bag of sand.
LOW ANGLE as the unconscious cop hits the deck, his BERETTA 9mm
AUTOMATIC clattering next to him.  A hand ENTERS FRAME and picks up

small explosions of breath in perfectly-metered time.
PAN TO a bedframe leaned upright against the wall, legs facing
outward.  A pair of sweaty hands grip one leg.  Tendons knot and
release as SOMEONE does pull-ups.  A man of tangled hair hides the
face that comes INTO FRAME, dips out, comes back.
WIDER.  A WOMAN in a tank top and hospital pants in hanging from the
top leg of the vertical bedframe.  Her body is straight and taut.
Knees bent so the feet clear the ground.  The arms are lean and

some kind of black-box electronics unit he's got in his ever-present
knapsack.  He holds the pack between his knees and pulls out a
little lap-top keyboard, which is also connected to the black-box.
John enters a few commands and the plasma-screen displays the PIN

servo-mechanism like Terminator is underneath, with its complex
hydraulics and cables... this thing is a featureless, liquid chrome
surface, bending seamlessly at knees and elbows as it walks.  It
reminds us of mercury.  A mercury man.  Its face is simple, unformed.

stiletto, slamming into the guard's eye.

We catch a glimpse of Janelle Voight checkered with the linoleum tile
colors, Lewis the Guard with knives exploding from his face, other
faces, switching at a stroboscopic rate now... a face every two frames
until they merge into one face --
The T-1000 screams and slips beneath the surface of the molten steel.
We see liquid silver running in dissipating whorls over the
superheated surface... until it vanishes, swirling into nothing."|stage direction
