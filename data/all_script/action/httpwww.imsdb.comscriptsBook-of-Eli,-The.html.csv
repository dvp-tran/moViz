3||EXT. FOREST - DAWN|location
4||"Bare as all hell. The trees stripped of their bark and white
like ghosts. Some torn violently from their roots and felled.
STARK GRAY SUNLIGHT shafts between the trees, clouded by a
creeping fog that obscures the true color of everything. A
LIGHT SNOW flutters. The world monochrome, lifeless and cold.
A CAT prowls across the dead earth. Barely recognizable as
the domestic breed it might once have been. Its fur mangy and
rank, body rib-thin from starvation. Entirely feral.
It moves slowly, cautiously. Sniffing the air, scanning the
forest, alert. Trusting nothing of its surroundings. It paces
across a leaf-strewn clearing, closing stealthily on:
A DEAD MAN, splayed face-down in the earth. His feet bare.
Face frozen in a grim death mask. A GAPING GUNSHOT WOUND in
his head, the dried blood caked around it matting his hair.
As the cat moves closer, approaching warily:
P.O.V. FROM ACROSS THE CLEARING
About thirty yards away. Someone is watching. Waiting. SLOW,
DEEP BREATHS, heard through a GASMASK RESPIRATOR.
CLOSE ON A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL GOGGLES
The MIRRORED LENSES reflecting the forest clearing, locked
onto the cat. The slow, metered breathing continues.
THE CAT slows, but continues pacing toward the corpse. More
cautious than ever. It inches forward, sniffing at the body.
ON THE WATCHER. Crouched behind the mangled stump of a felled
tree. Concealed beneath a camouflaging mesh of leaves, twigs
and bracken. A ""ghillie suit"" of the kind used by snipers.
THE CAT sniffs at the dead man's hand, frozen by death in a
grotesquely contorted claw. The animal still unsure. Looks
around again, checking its surroundings for predators.
THE WATCHER moves almost imperceptibly. The leaves covering
him rustle ever so slightly as we hear - just barely - the
familiar creaking sound of a BOW STRING BEING DRAWN TAUT.
THE CAT hears it. Looks up, alert. Staring right at the
watcher, but he is too well camouflaged to be seen. An
interminable, tense BEAT - is the prey going to flee?
Finally, the cat turns its attention back to the carcass,
nibbling gingerly at the flesh of the man's fingers."|stage direction

6||"THE WATCHER looses the arrow. It sails across the clearing
and SKEWERS THE CAT clean through. It drops to the ground.
THE WATCHER STANDS, shaking off the ghillie suit, revealing
him to us for the first time.
He wears a weather-beaten knee-length duster. Hooded sweater
with more layers beneath that. Torn pants and scuffed work
boots. Everything filthy and battered from years of wear.
Along with the goggles, his face remains obscured by a
DISPOSABLE PAPER DUST MASK and a CRUDELY-FASHIONED FUR HAT
with dangling ear flaps that may once itself have been a cat.
Around his neck he wears a silver SAINT CHRISTOPHER PENDANT
hanging from a frayed twine cord.
His name is ELI.
He shoulders the bow and walks across the clearing. Crouches
beside the dead cat and pulls out the arrow. Wipes the blood
from the shaft, then reaches down to collect the body.
Suddenly the cat SCREECHES AND FLAILS WILDLY! Eli recoils,
falling backward, stunned, as the cat - MORTALLY WOUNDED BUT
FIGHTING TO THE DEATH - bites and claws desperately at him.
Eli struggles violently with the cat, wrestling it to the
ground and grabbing up a HUNK OF FALLEN BRANCH. He holds the
writhing animal down and CLUBS IT until it lays still.
He sits back, breathing harder than the dustmask will allow.
He yanks it down, revealing the dirty, unshaven face beneath.
Impossible to tell his age, but certainly not a young man.
For a moment he just sits there. Then bundles up the dead cat
and returns to the mangled tree stump. Folds away his ghillie
suit into a nearby RUCKSACK which he hauls up onto his back.
A canteen dangles from the backpack, a SHOTGUN strapped to
its side. Eli reaches down for his final possession - an old
SAMURAI SWORD in a scabbard which he slings across his back.
He gazes up at the sky. A snowflake drifts down and lands on
his cheek. He reaches up and brushes it away, leaving a BLACK
SMEAR on his face. Not snow after all, but some kind of ASH."|stage direction
7||EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY|location
8||"Eli emerges from the treeline onto the cracked and ruptured
asphalt. Lined by more of those ghostly, stripped-bare trees."|stage direction
9||3.|unknown
10||"He sniffs the air, breathing it in. Checks the road in both
directions. Deserted. A few yards away is the rusted, burned-
out chassis of a CAR. He heads toward it.
The car rests half on the road, half in the adjacent ditch.
Stripped of its tires and engine. In the driver's seat is a
MUMMIFIED BODY. A BULLET HOLE piercing its forehead.
Eli regards the body dispassionately. Tries the door handle
but it's jammed. He yanks on it harder and eventually
wrenches it open. He leans in and checks the man's feet.
They're bare. No shoes or socks. Eli curses under his breath.
He leaves the car behind and heads on down the road. As he
walks away, we see that the sole of one of his boots has worn
loose, held in place now only by a rubber band."|stage direction
11||EXT. ROAD - DAY|location
12||"Eli continues down the road. He ambles along slowly, a man in
no hurry. A man who has been walking a long time.
The road has since emerged from the forest. Passing now
through a wasteland of dead scrub brush and urban junk.
The sun beats down from directly overhead. The sky has no
color to it, paper-white. The unfiltered sun's stark light
leaves everything seeming bleached-out, over-exposed.
CRANE UP as Eli walks on. On the horizon is the silhouette of
a CITY. Or what was once a city. Columns of BLACK SMOKE rise
from within, casting a deathly pall over the skyline. BURNED
AND BROKEN SKYSCRAPERS jut out like tombstones.
Eli reaches a fork in the road and stops. The road he's on
appears to wind off in the direction of the ruined city on
the horizon. The other fork continues on into the wasteland.
After a brief pause, Eli changes direction and heads off down
the other fork, away from the city."|stage direction
13||EXT. ABANDONED TOWN - DAY|location
14||"Little more than a main street lined with storefronts. Eli
walks steadily along, side-stepping rubble and debris.
Ignoring the petrified corpses lying in the street.
He passes by abandoned stores, every one picked clean. Empty
shelves, smashed windows. Looted and burned. He doesn't even
look inside, knowing already that he will find nothing.
Until he comes to a store that does cause him to stop. An old-
fashioned sign squeaks on rusted hinges in the breeze."|stage direction

17||"He steps into the doorway and pushes open the door. It swings
open on its one remaining hinge before splintering away from
the frame and crashing to the floor in a cloud of dust."|stage direction
18||INT. SHOE STORE - CONTINUOUS|location
19||"Eli steps inside. Like all the others, the store has been
cleaned out. Shoe racks and empty boxes strewn over the
floor. The whole place reeking of dead, musty air.
Eli looks around, just to be sure. Drags his sheathed sword
idly along the empty racks as he checks them. Nothing.
As he turns back for the door, his foot nudges against a shoe
box. It's not empty. He crouches down, flips the lid off
hopefully... and pulls out a LADY'S HIGH-HEELED SHOE.
He strokes the shoe leather with his hand. Shakes his head
grimly, then tosses the shoe back into the box and leaves."|stage direction
20||EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY|location
21||"On the outskirts of town. In disrepair - peeling paint,
broken windows, damp-stained walls - but habitable.
Eli stands in the front yard, surrounded by brownish,
overgrown weeds. Thinking it over. Turns to face the setting
sun. It will be dark soon. He turns back toward the house."|stage direction
22||INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY|location
23||"The front door is sent CRASHING OPEN with a hard kick,
revealing Eli silhouetted in the fading sunlight. The shotgun
unhitched from his pack and held ready. He moves inside.
Another dead place. Flies buzzing in the still, dank air.
Everything covered in a thick layer of dust but otherwise
largely preserved. An eerie snapshot of a world long gone.
KITCHEN
Every cupboard empty. Eli checks each one, poking around in
the dark corners with his sword, but finds nothing but dust.
He opens the freezer, checks inside. Empty save for a small
ICEBOX. The lid stuck fast with mildew and gunk. Eli digs at
it with his grimy fingernails and manages to pry it open.
Inside are the wizened, petrified remains of a HUMAN HAND.
Floating in slimy, discolored water. The smell vile and thick
enough to make Eli retch. He quickly jams the lid back on."|stage direction
24||5.|unknown
25||"BEDROOM
A wooden bedframe stripped clean. The dresser drawers have
been emptied and lie strewn across the floor. Eli moves
toward a large walk-in closet and opens the door.
No clothes inside - just the near-fossilized corpse of a MAN
HANGING BY A NOOSE. Twisting gently back and forth.
Unfazed, Eli crouches down and checks the man's feet. An old
pair of Converse All-Stars hang limp from the man's skeletal
ankles. Eli calmly sets about unlacing them.
He checks the size; they're a fit. He upturns each shoe and
shakes the old flakes of mummified flesh from them. Discards
his ruined boots and puts on the sneakers, laces them up.
He walks around, pacing up and down, getting a feel for the
new shoes. They feel good. For the first time, he smiles.
LATER
Eli sits in the corner, roasting the carcass of the dead cat
over a small CAMPFIRE. He cleans the animal's pelts as he
watches it cook. Pokes at the meat with a pen-knife, checking
it for done-ness. It appears ready to eat.
He clasps his hands together in prayer."|stage direction
26|ELI|"Dear Lord, thank you for your
generosity in providing us today
with this bountiful feast."|speech
27||"He speaks QUIETLY, his voice barely above a whisper. Even so,
we catch the accent - a RASPY, OLD-WORLD MIDWEST DRAWL, like
John Wayne or some other long-forgotten western icon."|stage direction
28|ELI|"Thank you for the many gifts that
you have given me. Thank you for
your protection and your guidance.
Thank you for bringing me this far.
I know my long journey's end is
near. I ask now only for the
strength and the courage to
complete the task that you in your
infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow
upon me over all men. I won't let
you down. Amen."|speech
29||"He signs a cross over himself, then uses the knife to saw off
a chunk of meat. Takes a bite, savoring the taste with great
relish. To him, it's grade-A filet mignon."|stage direction
30||6.|unknown
31|ELI|Hey. You hungry?|speech
32||"It appears as though he is talking to himself... until a RAT
emerges from his coat pocket, whiskers twitching keenly. Eli
offers it some meat. The rat gnaws enthusiastically at it.
SUNDOWN
The last of the waning sunlight shafts through the bedroom's
broken window. Eli rummages through his backpack, pulls out a
SMALL PACKAGE wrapped in cloth and tied fast with string.
He sits back in his corner and carefully unwraps it. It's an
OLD LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The binding cracked and pages dog-
eared, thumbed through a thousand times and more.
Eli gazes lovingly at it. Lets his fingers play across the
beat-up old leather cover. A cherished thing.
He begins to read, half-hidden in the shadows of the fading
sunlight. Silently mouthing the words as he reads them.
MANY PAGES LATER
Eli closes the book and parcels it back up as before.
Replaces it in his pack, then reaches in for something else.
A CAR BATTERY. Old and streaked with acid stains. Attached to
a tangled bunch of ELECTRICAL WIRING and JUMPER CABLES. Eli
reaches into his pocket and produces:
AN IPOD. Badly beat-up, the case pretty much held together
with duct tape. But functional. Eli attaches the battery
cable to the iPod and places the headphones in his ears.
The music plays. Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 in D Minor.
Eli rests back against the wall and pushes the volume way up.
THE MUSIC SWELLS. Eli's fingers dance and swoop in the air,
as though conducting an orchestra, as he is transported by
the music to another world, a world far from this one.
MORNING
Sunlight shafts through the window. Eli sits slumped in the
exact same position, headphones still in his ears. Asleep.
The rat scurries up Eli's chest and licks his face. Slowly,
he wakes, realizing he fell asleep with his music still on.
Checks the battery. It's dead, drained overnight. He frowns.
He gets to his feet, moves to the window and checks outside.
All seems quiet. He loads up his backpack and weapons."|stage direction

34|ELI|Come on now.|speech
35||"The rat scurries up his leg, onto his duster and disappears
into the breast pocket. Eli turns and moves out."|stage direction
36||EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - MORNING|location
37||"The gate squeaks shut behind Eli as he exits the front yard.
He breathes in the air, turns to feel the warm morning sun on
his face. Then turns away from it and walks on down the road."|stage direction
38||EXT. ROAD - DAY|location
39||"The landscape barren and featureless, road lined with dead
trees. Eli walks along the warped and broken asphalt.
The road is strewn with burned-out cars and debris from a
world long dead. A warped metal sign by the side of the road
reads: LITTER REMOVAL NEXT TWO MILES BY: ""CIRCUIT CITY"".
Up ahead is a HUNCHED FIGURE by the side of the road. Eli
arrives to see that it's a YOUNG WOMAN. Bone-thin, dressed in
filthy rags. Skin plagued by an unpleasant rash.
The SHOPPING CART she was pushing has overturned into a
roadside ditch, spilling its contents. Blankets, tins of
food, old clothes. She's on her knees trying to gather it up.
She looks up as she sees Eli approaching. Instantly cowers
from him, raising her hands to protect herself. Terrified."|stage direction
40|YOUNG WOMAN|"Oh. Please don't hurt me. Here,
take anything you want. You want
some food? Take it."|speech
41||"She offers him a can of pet food with a trembling hand. Eli
stands there looking at her. His expression impossible to
read behind the mirrored goggles."|stage direction
42|ELI|I'm not going to hurt you.|speech
43|YOUNG WOMAN|That's what the last guys said.|speech
44||"Eli bends down and picks up a couple of the cart's spilled
contents. Steps forward and offers them to her."|stage direction
45|ELI|Here.|speech
46||8.|unknown
47||She blinks. Unsure. Cautiously she reaches out and takes it.|stage direction
48|YOUNG WOMAN|"Could you help me? The wheel came
off. I can't fix it. Maybe if I
could get it out of the ditch. But
I can't."|speech
49||"Eli looks at the cart. It has come to rest in the ditch just
inches from a THICK BRACKEN HEDGEROW that lines the road.
He looks again at the girl. Her faded blouse is unbuttoned,
revealing a little cleavage. Her skirt torn along the leg,
showing more than a little thigh. Almost deliberate.
He sniffs the air. Watches the hedgerow warily. Just like the
cat he hunted, his senses heightened and on alert.
Behind the hedge, THREE ROADSIDE BANDITS are crouched,
waiting to pounce. Each armed with a crude blunt weapon. They
exchange anxious looks.
ELI sniffs the air again - then backs away from the girl."|stage direction
50|ELI|"One good thing about no soap any
more. You can smell the road agents
a mile off."|speech
51||"The girl's face falls as Eli backs up. The three bandits
EMERGE FROM THE HEDGEROW, brandishing their weapons. A couple
of them wear old sunglasses and goggles similar to Eli's.
The BANDIT LEADER grabs the girl by a fistful of hair as he
passes, yanking her painfully to her feet."|stage direction
52|BANDIT LEADER|Dumb bitch. What did we tell you?|speech
53||"He pushes her away, she crumples to the road in a heap.
Eli backs away, but TWO MORE ARMED BANDITS drop from hiding
in the trees behind, cutting off his escape, surrounding him."|stage direction
54|BANDIT LEADER|What you got there in the pack?|speech
55||ELI|unknown
56|BANDIT LEADER|Nothing.|speech
57|BANDIT LEADER|"Yeah, that's what they all say. How
about you take it off real slow and
tip it out so's we can take a look?"|speech

64|BANDIT #2|Open the fucking pack or die.|speech
65|ELI|I can't do that.|speech
66||"The bandit leader steps forward aggressively. Now within
striking distance of Eli. He grins, teeth filthy and rotten."|stage direction
67|BANDIT LEADER|"Want us to do it for you? We can
get it off real easy after we've
hacked your fucking arms off."|speech
68||"Eli remains perfectly calm. And though he speaks with a soft,
even tone, there is something formidable about his voice."|stage direction
69|ELI|"It's real important you boys listen
to me and understand. The man I
work for, you do not want to cross
him. See, I'm under his protection.
You stand in my way, you stand in
his. And he will cut you down with
a righteous fury - through me. For
I am his faithful instrument."|speech
70||"BEAT. The bandit leader looks at Eli incredulously... and
then LAUGHS. The other bandits laugh along nervously."|stage direction
71|BANDIT LEADER|"What the hell are you, some kinda
preacher?"|speech
72|ELI|Something like that.|speech
73|BANDIT LEADER|"Well I got news for you, preacher
man. Whatever kinda God you reckon
yourself to be working for, he left
these parts a long time ago. He
ain't here to protect your ass. Now
take off the pack and set it on the
ground."|speech
74||10.|location
75||"Eli doesn't move, doesn't say a word. The bandit leader takes
another step forward and shoves him in the shoulder."|stage direction
76|BANDIT LEADER|You fucking listening to me?|speech
77|ELI|"I hear you. You lay that hand on me
again and you will not get it back."|speech
78||"The other bandits exchange nervous looks. This is not how
it's supposed to go."|stage direction
79|BANDIT LEADER|"All right, I had just about enough
of this shit..."|speech
80||"He lunges forward, grabs the shoulder strap of Eli's pack.
If you blinked, you missed it. But somehow Eli has now drawn
his sword. A RIVULET OF BLOOD snakes down along the blade and
drips onto the asphalt.
Bandit leader's hand is still gripped firmly around Eli's
shoulder strap. But it's no longer connected to his arm. The
SEVERED HAND hangs there from the strap, dripping blood.
Bandit leader staggers backward and raises the bloody stump
where his hand once was. Looks at it in shock and horror."|stage direction
81|BANDIT LEADER|"What... you just... he just cut my
fucking hand off! My fucking hand!"|speech
82||"Eli pries the hand loose from the strap and tosses it onto
the road as bandit leader's legs give out and he slumps to
the asphalt. His eyes dart around, as though confused."|stage direction
83|BANDIT LEADER|"What you standin' around for? Kiss
him!"|speech
84|BANDIT #3|What's he talkin' about, kiss him?|speech
85|ELI|"He's in shock. He means ""kill him""."|speech
86||"A tense BEAT. And then the four remaining bandits ATTACK ELI
ALL AT ONCE, weapons flailing.
Eli flourishes the sword. A BLUR, TOO FAST TO FOLLOW. But
it's clear he is possessed of an inhuman level of skill."|stage direction
87||11.|unknown
88||"It is over in moments. The four bandits LAY SLAIN IN THE
ROAD, blood pooling out onto the asphalt.
The bandit leader crawls toward his severed hand, a few yards
away. Eli steps in and kicks it out of his reach."|stage direction
89||ELI|unknown
90|ELI|"I told you you wouldn't be getting
that back."|speech
91||"Bandit leader looks up to see the figure of Eli bearing down
on him, silhouetted ominously against the sun. He looks for a
moment like an avenging angel, something not of this world."|stage direction
92|BANDIT LEADER|Who are you?|speech
93|ELI|My name is Eli.|speech
94||"And with that, Eli runs him through with his sword.
He turns to see the young woman slumped in the road, sobbing.
She cowers again as he approaches, certain that she is next.
He WALKS PAST HER. Sheathes his sword, then pulls out the
shopping cart from the ditch and rights it. The woman watches
incredulously as he gathers up her supplies into the cart."|stage direction
95|ELI|"Take it and go on your way. And
don't fall in with men like these
again. No good can come."|speech
96||She looks at him, puzzled.|stage direction
97|YOUNG WOMAN|Why are you doing this?|speech
98||"Eli says nothing. Walks back to the slain bandits, crouches
beside them and begins searching their bodies.
He takes a scarf from around the neck of one. Finds a Zippo
lighter on another, checks that it works and pockets it.
LATER
The five bodies are lined neatly in the ditch, half-covered
with dirt. The best burial they are going to get.
Eli stands before them, head bowed in prayer. He speaks
quietly and quickly, a speech he has given many times."|stage direction

the death and resurrection of his
son has reconciled the world to
himself and sent the holy spirit
among us for the forgiveness of
sins."|speech

transfixed. She has never seen anyone like him."|stage direction

may he give you pardon and peace,
and I absolve you from your sins in
the name of the father, and of the
son, and of the holy spirit. Amen."|speech

112||EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY|location
113||"Straddling the desert like a giant, crumbling monument to a
long-dead civilization. Eli steadily climbs his way up.
He comes to an abrupt stop as we realize suddenly that the
overpass has COLLAPSED at mid-point. RUSTED IRON RODS jut out
from where the roadway has been severed.
Eli just stands there at the edge for a moment, feeling the
wind whip around him, his coat fluttering in the breeze."|stage direction
114||13.|location
115||"The overpass's collapsed section is now just a MOUNTAINOUS
PILE OF RUBBLE that leads down to the road below.
Eli steps onto the rubble. About to make his way down when he
FREEZES. He hears something. The faintest of sounds. He takes
cover, peering down at the road beneath the overpass to see:
TWO PEOPLE walking together on the road. We see everything
from ELI'S P.O.V. - too far to make out much detail, but
apparently it is a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE.
The man pushes along an OLD WHEELBARROW covered by a tarp as
the woman, seemingly his wife, walks alongside. The barrow's
rusted wheel gives out a plaintive, rhythmic SQUEAK.
Eli ducks down again as he hears something else. This time
much louder. The menacing growl of MOTORCYCLE ENGINES.
FOUR BIKES IN TOTAL. Riding out of the horizon, closing in on
the couple. They see the bikes coming and panic. Try
desperately to steer the barrow off the road.
The bikes screech to a halt and the FOUR RIDERS dismount.
Brandishing a variety of weapons. The couple make a run for
it but they're quickly chased down and tackled to the ground.
The woman SCREAMS and struggles helplessly as the bikers
swarm over the man like a pack of predatory animals.
The woman is pulled to the ground and the clothes stripped
from her. Eli turns away. He knows what comes next.
Eli listens as the woman screams and screams. He reaches for
his shotgun... hesitates... then withdraws his hand."|stage direction
116|ELI|"It ain't your concern. Stay on the
path. It ain't your concern. Stay
on the path."|speech
117||"Eli repeats it like a mantra. He clearly wants to intervene,
but will not permit himself to. Instead, he simply sits and
waits grimly as the woman continues to scream for help. And
then finally, suddenly, is silenced.
Down below, the bodies of the man and woman lay dead and
bloodied in the dirt. The bikers tear the tarp from the
wheelbarrow, spilling its contents onto the asphalt.
They ferret through the items, scavenging a few items - we
don't see what - and stuffing them into an old cloth satchel.
They leave the rest strewn in the road and ride off in the
direction they came, dust pluming in their wake."|stage direction

the far distance before emerging from his hiding place."|stage direction

a cross over their ravaged bodies as he mutters a prayer
under his breath. Then stands and continues on down the road."|stage direction
122||EXT. ROAD FORK - DAY|location
123||"More desolate wasteland as far as the eye can see. The road
forks again here. Eli arrives at the junction and stops.
The road Eli is on leads further into the west. The other
fork heads toward a SMALL TOWN just visible on the horizon.
A HAND-PAINTED SIGN has been driven into the dirt nearby. No
words, just a series of CRUDE PICTOGRAMS. A BED. A PLATE OF
FOOD. A WATER FAUCET. AN ARROW points toward the town.
Eli pauses, thinking it over. Retrieves the iPod from his
pocket. Clicks the button, but no response. He sighs.
He turns and heads down the other fork, toward town."|stage direction
124||EXT. DESERT TOWN - OUTSKIRTS - DAY|location
125||"A primitive, sprawling village of tents and barn-like
structures. Built from corrugated iron, rotted wood, molded
plastic, tarpaulin - materials scavenged from the old world.
HUDDLED RESIDENTS are dressed in little more than rags, many
wearing goggles like Eli's to shield their eyes from the sun.
Eli stands at the edge of town. Reluctant to enter, but he
braces himself and walks on in. And as he rounds a corner,
entering the center of town, an astonishing sight:"|stage direction
126||EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS|location
127||"The broad thoroughfare now all that remains of whatever town
once stood here. Many of the old storefronts still largely
intact but patched up with salvaged materials. The asphalt
street warped and cracked, parking meters bent and smashed.
It's a lot like the abandoned town Eli passed through
earlier, except VERY MUCH ALIVE - BUSTLING WITH TOWNSFOLK.
It's at once a familiar and also a disturbing sight - like an
old Norman Rockwell painting of classic small-town America,
but filtered through the devastating eye of an apocalypse. An
unsettling juxtaposition of the old world and the new."|stage direction
128||15.|location
129||"The centerpiece of the town is a GRAND THEATER at the head of
the main street. THE PALLADIUM. Like the rest of the town,
badly damaged and shoddily fixed-up. But still standing.
Eli walks down the street and approaches a BLACKSMITH,
hammering out a metal plate over an anvil outside his store."|stage direction
130|ELI|"You got an engineer or a fuelman
around here?"|speech
131||"The blacksmith doesn't look up from his work but motions
toward a storefront at the far end of the street."|stage direction
132|ELI|Thanks.|speech
133||"Eli heads down the street. Stopping when he comes across a
STATUE erected in the center of the road. A TALL MAN crudely
fashioned in clay. One hand placed paternally on the head of
a SMALL CHILD, the other outstretched toward the sun.
As he observes the statue, Eli notices that passing residents
take a moment to PAUSE AND GENUFLECT before it. Worshipping.
Curious, Eli reaches up and runs his hand over the statue's
face. Then hears SHUFFLING FEET behind him and turns as a
PARADE OF EMACIATED MEN AND WOMEN trudges past. Roped
together at the waist, each man leading the one behind.
Heads shaved, thin from malnutrition. And each one BLIND.
They gaze at the ground with pale, dead eyes. They carry

streams down his thighs. A real horror show.
