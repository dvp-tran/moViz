A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title.
War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup slowly crawls
into infinity."|stage direction
3||"It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships,
striking from a hidden base, have won their first
victory against the evil Galactic Empire.
During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal
secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the
Death Star, an armored space station with enough
power to destroy an entire planet.
Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess
Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of
the stolen plans that can save her people and
restore freedom to the galaxy..."|unknown
4||"The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total
eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny
silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers
from the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed
by a giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly
laserbolts streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing
the main solar fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate."|stage direction

6||"An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-
D2) and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way
through the shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are
old and battered. Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His
face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye.
Threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of
human proportions. He has a gleaming bronze-like metallic
surface of an Art Deco design.
Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way."|stage direction
7|THREEPIO|"Did you hear that? They've shut down
the main reactor. We'll be destroyed
for sure. This is madness!"|speech
8||"Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions in
the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door."|stage direction
9|THREEPIO|We're doomed!|speech
10||"The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that
only another robot could understand."|stage direction
11|THREEPIO|"There'll be no escape for the Princess
this time."|speech
12||"Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as
loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment
are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship."|stage direction
13|THREEPIO|What's that?|speech
14||EXT. SPACECRAFT IN SPACE|location
15||"The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade
Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the
underside dock of the giant Imperial starship."|stage direction
16||INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER|location
17||"The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a
tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and
a score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make
their way into the smoke-filled corridor.
In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with
laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns
creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck
behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers
who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered
arms and faces.
An explosion hits near the robots."|stage direction
18|THREEPIO|"I should have known better than to
trust the logic of a half-sized
thermocapsulary dehousing assister..."|speech

around the two hapless robots."|stage direction
20||EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT WASTELAND - DAY|location
21||"A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon.
The tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone
figure, Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations
who looks much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy
hair and baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable
lad with a prize-winning smile.
A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a
large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the
desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided
by a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot
appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.
A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and
he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his
utility belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying
the heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired
Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet
above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the
tiny robot to follow him."|stage direction
22|LUKE|"Hurry up! Come with me! What are you
waiting for?! Get in gear!"|speech
23||"The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and
smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his
arms up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps
into his Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum
madly."|stage direction
24||INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - MAIN HALLWAY|location
25||"The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his
way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is
Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured
by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which
stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the
Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away
from the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through
the Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run
in a frenzied panic."|stage direction

Artoo makes beeping sounds."|stage direction

29||"Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is
nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel
soldiers can be heard in the distance."|stage direction
30|THREEPIO|Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?|speech
31||"A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and
he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a smoke-
filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen years
old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place,
dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting
something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little
robot joins his companion."|stage direction
32|THREEPIO|At last! Where have you been?|speech
33||Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.|stage direction
34|THREEPIO|"They're heading in this direction.
What are we going to do? We'll be
sent to the spice mine of Kessel or
smashed into who knows what!"|speech

subhallway. Threepio chases after him."|stage direction

an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord."|stage direction

in vain."|stage direction

intercepted?"|speech
43||Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.|stage direction

Aaah... This is a consular ship.
Were on a diplomatic mission."|speech
46|VADER|"If this is a consular ship... were
is the Ambassador?"|speech
47||"The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the
Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a
gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp.
Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to
his troops."|stage direction

you've found those plans and bring
me the Ambassador. I want her alive!"|speech

50||INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - SUBHALLWAY|location
51||"The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the
stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia
Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her
eyes slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds
of the approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the
troopers spots her."|stage direction
52|TROOPER|There she is! Set for stun!|speech
53||"Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with
her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a
paralyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body."|stage direction

Vader we have a prisoner."|speech

He snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light
begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into
the cramped four-man pod."|stage direction

It's restricted. You'll be deactivated
for sure.."|speech
58||Artoo beeps something to him.|stage direction
59|THREEPIO|"Don't call me a mindless philosopher,
you overweight glob of grease! Now
come out before somebody sees you."|speech
60||"Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding
the mission he is about to perform."|stage direction
61|THREEPIO|"Secret mission? What plans? What are
you talking about? I'm not getting
in there!"|speech
62||"Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps
and twangs angrily.
A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris
through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and,
after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky
robot jumps into the lifepod."|stage direction
63|THREEPIO|I'm going to regret this.|speech

robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft."|stage direction

73||EXT. TATOOINE - ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT - POWER STATION - DAY|location
74||"Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white
buildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty
empty street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to
get out of the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist
at Luke as he flies past."|stage direction
75|WOMAN|I've told you kids to slow down!|speech
76||INT. POWER STATION - DAY|location
77||"Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged
mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been
asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the
office, yelling wildly."|stage direction
78|FIXER|"Did I hear a young noise blast through
here?"|speech
79|CAMIE|It was just wormie on another rampage.|speech
80||"Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak
and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are
playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly,
handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy
city attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics
of the farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the
background."|stage direction
81|LUKE|Shape it up you guys!... Biggs?|speech
82||"Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to great
joy and emotion. They give each other a great bear hug."|stage direction
83|LUKE|"I didn't know you were back! When
did you get in?"|speech
84|BIGGS|"Just now. I wanted to surprise you,
hot shot. I thought you'd be here...
certainly didn't expect you to be
out working."|speech
85||(he laughs)|location
86|LUKE|"The Academy didn't change you
much...but you're back so soon? Hey,
what happened, didn't you get your
commission?"|speech
87||Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.|stage direction
88|BIGGS|"Of course I got it. Signed aboard
The Rand Ecliptic last week. First
mate Biggs Darklighter at your
service..."|speech
89||(he salutes)|location
90|BIGGS|"...I just came to say good-bye to
all you unfortunate landlocked
simpletons."|speech
91||"Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing friend
is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out of
it."|stage direction
92|LUKE|"I almost forgot. There's a battle
going on! Right here in our system.
Come and look!"|speech

95||"DAY
The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie
and The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes.
Luke has his binoculars out scanning the heavens."|stage direction
96|LUKE|There they are!|speech
97||"Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain to
see something with the naked eye. Through the binoculars
Biggs sees two small silver specks."|stage direction
98|BIGGS|"That's no battle, hot shot... they're
just sitting there! Probably a
freighter-tanker refueling."|speech
99|LUKE|"But there was a lot of firing
earlier..."|speech
100||"Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the
building in the process. Luke grabs them."|stage direction
101|LUKE|Hey, easy with those...|speech
102|CAMIE|Don't worry about it, Wormie.|speech
103||"The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy shrugs
his shoulders in resignation."|stage direction
104|FIXER|"I keep telling you, the Rebellion is
a long way from here. I doubt if the
Empire would even fight to keep this
system. Believe me Luke, this planet
is a big hunk of nothing..."|speech
105||"Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The
group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about
Luke's ineptitude."|stage direction
106||INT. REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER - HALLWAY|location
107||"Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad
of armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is
brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly
marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader
emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard
at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move."|stage direction
108|LEIA|"Lord Vader, I should have known.
Only you could be so bold. The
Imperial Senate will not sit for
this, when they hear you've attacked
a diplomatic..."|speech
109|VADER|"Don't play games with me, Your
Highness. You weren't on any mercy
mission this time. You passed directly
through a restricted system. Several
transmissions were beamed to this
ship by Rebel spies. I want to know
what happened to the plans they sent
you."|speech
110|LEIA|"I don't know what you're talking
about. I'm a member of the Imperial
Senate on a diplomatic mission to
Alderaan..."|speech
111|VADER|"You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...
and a traitor. Take her away!"|speech
112||"Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering
hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial Commander
turns to Vader."|stage direction
113|COMMANDER|"Holding her is dangerous. If word of
this gets out, it could generate
sympathy for the Rebellion in the
senate."|speech
114|VADER|"I have traced the Rebel spies to
her. Now she is my only link to find
their secret base!"|speech
115|COMMANDER|"She'll die before she tells you
anything."|speech
116|VADER|"Leave that to me. Send a distress
signal and then inform the senate
that all aboard were killed!"|speech
117||"Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the Commander.
They stop and snap to attention."|stage direction
118|SECOND OFFICER|"Lord Vader, the battle station plans
are not aboard this ship! And no
transmissions were made. An escape
pod was jettisoned during the
fighting, but no life forms were
aboard."|speech
119||Vader turns to the Commander.|stage direction
120|VADER|"She must have hidden the plans in
the escape pod. Send a detachment
down to retrieve them. See to it
personally, Commander. There'll be
no one to stop us this time."|speech

planet Tatooine."|stage direction

125||"Jundland, or ""No Man's Land"", where the rugged desert mesas
meet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids
kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily
work their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in
the distance rests half buried in the sand."|stage direction
126|THREEPIO|"How did I get into this mess? I really
don't know how. We seem to be made
to suffer. It's our lot in life."|speech
127||Artoo answers with beeping sounds.|stage direction
128|THREEPIO|"I've got to rest before I fall apart.
My joints are almost frozen."|speech
129||Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.|stage direction
130|THREEPIO|What a desolate place this is.|speech
131||"Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and starts
off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio
stops and yells at him."|stage direction
132|THREEPIO|Where are you going?|speech
133||"A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small
robot."|stage direction
134|THREEPIO|"Well, I'm not going that way. It's
much too rocky. This way is much
easier."|speech
135||Artoo counters with a long whistle.|stage direction
136|THREEPIO|"What makes you think there are
settlements over there?"|speech
137||Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.|stage direction
138|THREEPIO|Don't get technical with me.|speech
139||Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.|stage direction
140|THREEPIO|"What mission? What are you talking
about? I've had just about enough of
you! Go that way! You'll be
malfunctioning within a day, you
nearsighted scrap pile!"|speech
141||"Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in the
direction of the vast dune sea."|stage direction
142|THREEPIO|"And don't let me catch you following
me begging for help, because you
won't get it."|speech
143||"Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges
off in the direction of the towering mesas."|stage direction
144|THREEPIO|"No more adventures. I'm not going
that way."|speech
145||"Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the distant
mountains."|stage direction
146||EXT. TATOOINE - DUNE SEA|location
147||"Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a
dune; only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless
miles.  He looks back in the direction of the now distant
rock mesas."|stage direction
148|THREEPIO|"That malfunctioning little twerp.
This is all his fault! He tricked me
into going this way, but he'll do no
better."|speech
149||"In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the sand
from his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint of
reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving
towards him."|stage direction
150|THREEPIO|"Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm
saved!"|speech
151||"The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the
approaching transport."|stage direction

and the others can be heard working inside."|stage direction
155||(Very animated)|location
156|LUKE|"...so I cut off my power, shut down
the afterburners and came in low on
Deak's trail. I was so close I thought
I was going to fry my instruments.
As it was I busted up the Skyhopper
pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty
upset. He grounded me for the rest
of the season. You should have been
there... it was fantastic."|speech
157|BIGGS|"You ought to take it easy Luke. You
may be the hottest bushpilot this
side of Mos Eisley, but those little
Skyhoppers are dangerous. Keep it
up, and one day, whammo, you're going
to be nothing more than a dark spot
on the down side of a canyon wall."|speech
158|LUKE|"Look who's talking. Now that you've
been around those giant starships
you're beginning to sound like my
uncle. You've gotten soft in the
city..."|speech
159|BIGGS|I've missed you kid.|speech
160|LUKE|"Well, things haven't been the same
since you left, Biggs. It's been
so... quiet."|speech
161||Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.|stage direction
162|BIGGS|"Luke, I didn't come back just to say
good-bye... I shouldn't tell you
this, but you're the only one I can
trust... and if I don't come back, I
want somebody to know."|speech

164|LUKE|What are you talking about?|speech
165|BIGGS|I made some friends at the Academy.|speech
166||(he whispers)|location
167|BIGGS|"...when our frigate goes to one of
the central systems, we're going to
jump ship and join the Alliance..."|speech
168||Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.|stage direction
169|LUKE|"Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding!
How?"|speech
170|BIGGS|"Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth
bigger than a meteor crater!"|speech
171|LUKE|I'm sorry. I'm quiet.|speech
172||(he whispers)|location
173|LUKE|"Listen how quiet I am. You can barely
hear me..."|speech
174||Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.|stage direction
175|BIGGS|"My friend has a friend on Bestine
who might help us make contact."|speech
176|LUKE|"You're crazy! You could wander around
forever trying to find them."|speech
177|BIGGS|"I know it's a long shot, but if I
don't find them I'll do what I can
on my own... It's what we always
talked about. Luke, I'm not going to
wait for the Empire to draft me into
service. The Rebellion is spreading
and I want to be on the right side --
the side I believe in."|speech
178|LUKE|And I'm stuck here...|speech
179|BIGGS|"I thought you were going to the
Academy next term. You'll get your
chance to get off this rock."|speech
180|LUKE|"Not likely! I had to cancel my
application. There has been a lot of
unrest among the Sandpeople since
you left... they've even raided the
outskirts of Anchorhead."|speech
181|BIGGS|"Your uncle could hold off a whole
colony of Sandpeople with one blaster."|speech
182|LUKE|"I know, but he's got enough vaporators
going to make the place pay off. He
needs me for just one more season. I
can't leave him now."|speech
183|BIGGS|"I feel for you, Luke, you're going
to have to learn what seems to be
important or what really is important.
What good is all your uncle's work
if it's taken over by the Empire?...
You know they're starting to
nationalize commerce in the central
systems... it won't be long before
your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving
for the greater glory of the Empire."|speech
184|LUKE|"It couldn't happen here. You said it
yourself. The Empire won't bother
with this rock."|speech
185|BIGGS|Things always change.|speech
186|LUKE|"I wish I was going... Are you going
to be around long?"|speech
187|BIGGS|No, I'm leaving in the morning...|speech
188|LUKE|Then I guess I won't see you.|speech
189|BIGGS|Maybe someday... I'll keep a lookout.|speech
190|LUKE|"Well, I'll be at the Academy next
season... after that who knows. I
won't be drafted into the Imperial
Starfleet that's for sure... Take
care of yourself, you'll always be
the best friend I've got."|speech

194||"The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange
foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures
fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock
canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he
goes. He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for
a moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.
In the distance, a pebble tumbles down the steep canyon wall
and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little
further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a
pair of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the
narrow path.
The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until
suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out
of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages
one short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his
back. His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then
off again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller
than Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they
cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and
their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be
seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave
the heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down
the trail."|stage direction

196||"The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge tank-
like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a
small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a
large tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot
is sucked into the giant machine.
The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders
and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport."|stage direction

switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles
around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty

temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners
are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the
beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly
march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From
one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired
Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to
an equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the
whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other
dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is
dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.
She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He
winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who
is moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled
troops, who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo
beeps with happiness."|stage direction
