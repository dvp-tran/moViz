as voices drift in from the background.]"|speech
9|GANDALF|You cannot pass!|speech
10|FRODO|Gandalf!|speech
11|GANDALF|"I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder
of the Flame of Anor!
[Camera pans closer to the mountain
side.]"|speech
12|GANDALF|"Argh! Go back to the shadow. The Dark
Fire will not avail you, Flame of Udûn!
[Camera zooms in through the mountain
and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog
on the bridge of Khazad-dûm. The Balrog
strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming
sword. Gandalf parries the blow with
Glamdring, shattering the Balrog’s sword.]
YOU… SHALL NOT... PASS!!!
[Gandalf strikes his staff onto the
bridge. As the Balrog steps forward,
the bridge collapses from under it and
the demon plunges backward into the
chasm. Gandalf, exhausted, leans on
his staff and watches the Balrog fall
then turns to follow the others. At
the last minute, the flaming whip lashes
up from the depths of the abyss and
winds around Gandalf’s ankle, dragging
him over the edge. He clings onto the
bridge but is straining to keep his
grip.]"|speech
13|GANDALF|"Argh!
[Frodo rushes forward but Boromir restrains
him.]"|speech
14|BOROMIR|No! No!|speech
15|FRODO|Gandalf!|speech
16|GANDALF|"Fly, you fools!
[Gandalf loses his grip and falls into
the chasm]"|speech
17|FRODO|"Noooooooooooooooo!!!!
[Gandalf loses his grip and falls into
the chasm]"|speech
18|FRODO|"[Calls after Gandalf as he falls into
the abyss] Gaaandaaaaalf!!
[Gandalf falls after the Balrog and
grabs hold of his sword Glamdring on
his way down. As they continue to plunge
into the depths, Gandalf hacks away
at the Balrog even as it thrashes and
bounces off the walls. They continue
to plunge at great speed, sometimes
with Gandalf clinging to the horn of
the demon. The battling pair then falls
into an enormous cavern and plunges
into the water. Just then Frodo awakens
as if from a nightmare.]"|speech
19|FRODO|Gandalf!|speech
20|SAM|What is it, Mr. Frodo?|speech
21|FRODO|"Nothing. Just a dream. [Lies back down.]
[Frodo and Sam climbs over the rocky
terrain Emyn Muil. They look into the
distance at the Mountain of Fire.]"|speech
22|SAM|"Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don’t want to see any closer, and
the one place we’re trying to get to.
It’s just where we can’t get. Let’s
face it, Mr. Frodo, we’re lost. I don’t
think Gandalf meant for us to come this
way."|speech
23|FRODO|"He didn’t mean for a lot of things to
happen, Sam... but they did.
[Suddenly Frodo feels and sees the Eye
zooming in on him. He gasps and pants
as he backs away.]"|speech
24|SAM|Mr. Frodo? It’s the Ring, isn’t it?|speech
25|FRODO|"It’s getting heavier. [Clutches the
Ring by his chest and sits down, still
panting. He then fumbles for his water
bottle and takes a sip.]"|speech
26|FRODO|What food have we got left?|speech
27|SAM|"Well, let me see. [He takes out a package
of lembas bread from his pack] Oh yes,
lovely – Lembas bread. And look! [He
digs deeper into his pack] More lembas
bread.
[Sam shows another package. He then
breaks off a piece and tosses it to
Frodo, and munches on a piece himself.]"|speech
28|SAM|"I don't usually hold with foreign food,
but this Elvish stuff, it’s not bad."|speech
29|FRODO|"[smiles] Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it Sam?
[Sam smiles back, and then looks ominously
towards Mordor.]"|speech
30|SAM|"Those rain clouds might.
[They continue trekking through difficult
terrain, often huddling underneath their
cloaks.]"|speech
31|SAM|"[Looks around] This looks strangely
familiar."|speech
32|FRODO|"[Exasperated] It’s because we’ve been
here before! We’re going in circles."|speech
33|SAM|"Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant
there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you
smell it?"|speech
34|FRODO|"Yes. I can smell it. [Drops to a whisper]
We’re not alone."|speech
35|[NIGHTTIME|"Frodo and Sam are sleeping. A dark shape
appears on top of the cliff. The creature
Gollum has appeared and is making his
way down to the hobbits.]"|speech
36|GOLLUM|"The thieves! The thieves! The filthy
little thieves! Where is it? Where isss
it? They stole it from us. My preciousss.
[Gollum creeps closer and closer.] Curse
them! We hates them! It’s ours, it is...
and we wantssss it!
[Gollum reaches out his hand towards
the hobbits. Suddenly the hobbits spring
up, grab hold of Gollum’s arms and pull
him down. Amidst the struggle, Gollum
wriggles loose and leaps onto Frodo.
As Frodo falls back, the chain and Ring
around his neck is revealed and Gollum
jumps straight for the Ring. Sam tries
to grab at him but is knocked away.
Gollum now jumps on top of Frodo and
tries to reach for the Ring even as
Frodo grabs his hands and tries to push
him away. Gollum’s cheeks puff with
exertion as he struggles with Frodo,
his enormous eyes fixed on the Ring.
Sam grabs hold of Gollum again and tears
him away from Frodo. Gollum then turns
around and bites Sam on the shoulder,
wriggles around and clasps his arms
around Sam’s neck and legs around his
waist in a death grip. Frodo unsheathes
Sting and holds it to Gollum's throat.]"|speech
37|FRODO|"[menacingly] This is Sting. You’ve seen
it before, haven’t you... Gollum! Release
him or I’ll cut your throat!
[Slowly, Gollum loosens his grip on
Sam and as the latter disentangles himself,
Gollum wails. In the next scene, Gollum
is being dragged with Sam's Elvish rope
around his neck, wailing and writhing
in pain.]"|speech
38|GOLLUM|"It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty
Elves twisted it. Take it off us!"|speech
39|SAM|"Quiet you!
[Sam tugs fiercely at the rope. Gollum
cries some more and collapses onto his
back. Sam turns to Frodo in dismay.]"|speech
40|SAM|"It’s hopeless! Every Orc in Mordor’s
going to hear this racket! Let’s just
tie him up and leave him."|speech
41|GOLLUM|No! That would kill us! Kill us!|speech
42|SAM|It’s no more than you deserve!|speech
43|FRODO|"Maybe he does deserve to die, but now
that I see him, I do pity him."|speech
44|GOLLUM|"[Begging] We be nice to them if they
be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears
to do what you wants. We swears."|speech
45|FRODO|"There’s no promise you can make that
I can trust."|speech
46|GOLLUM|"We swears to serve the master of the
preciousss. We swears on... on the precious.
*Gollum. Gollum.*"|speech
47|FRODO|"The Ring is treacherous. It will hold
you to your word."|speech
48|GOLLUM|Yes... on the preciousss. On the preciousss.|speech
49|SAM|"I don’t believe you! [Gollum backs away,
frightened, and climbs onto a boulder]
Get down! I said, down!
[Sam jerks strongly at the rope as Gollum
tries to get away from him. He crashes
onto the ground, choking.]"|speech
50|FRODO|Sam!|speech
51|SAM|"He’s trying to trick us! We let him
go he’ll throttle us in our sleep!
[Gollum lies panting and holding his
throat. He backs away, frightened, as
Frodo approaches him.]"|speech
52|FRODO|You know the way to Mordor?|speech
53|GOLLUM|[nods warily] Yes...|speech
54|FRODO|You’ve been there before?|speech
55|GOLLUM|"[nods again] Yes...
[Frodo reaches out and takes the rope
noose off Gollum’s neck. Gollum seems
surprised and relieved.]"|speech
56|FRODO|"You will lead us to the Black Gate.
[Gollum scrambles off in the direction
of Morannon and the hobbits follow in
his wake.]
[A band of Uruk-hai marches across the
plain, with two hobbits bound to the
backs of two Uruk-hai. Pippin tries
to call to Merry, who is unconscious
with a gash on his right brow.]"|speech
57|PIPPIN|"Merry. Merry! [He receives no response.]
[Suddenly, an Uruk-hai puts up his hand
and signals a stop.]"|speech
58|UGLÚK|What is it? What do you smell?|speech
59|MAN-FLESH URUK|[sniffs the air] Man-flesh.|speech
60|PIPPIN|[quietly to himself] Aragorn!|speech
61|UGLÚK|"They've picked up our trail! Let's move!
[The Uruk-hai quicken their pace. Pippin
struggles to reach his Elven brooch
with his teeth. He then tears it off
his cloak and drops it onto the ground.
A foot stomps onto the brooch but it
remains unbroken and visible on the
grass.]
[Aragorn is lying with his eyes closed
and ear pressed to the ground, listening
for the sound of footsteps.]"|speech
62|ARAGORN|"Their pace has quickened. [He looks
up.] They must have caught our scent.
Hurry! [He runs off.]"|speech
63|LEGOLAS|"Come on, Gimli! [Looks back at Gimli
and then runs after Aragorn]"|speech
64|GIMLI|"[pauses in his steps and huffs] Three
days’ and nights’ pursuit. No food.
No rest. And no sign of our quarry but
what bare rock can tell. [Runs after
his companions.]
[The Three Hunters run across rocks
and plains, with Aragorn in the lead,
followed by Legolas and Gimli. From
time to time, Legolas looks back to
make sure that Gimli is keeping up.
Aragorn suddenly bends down to pick
up an Elven brooch from the ground.]"|speech
65|ARAGORN|Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.|speech
66|LEGOLAS|"[stops and turns to Aragorn.] They may
yet be alive."|speech
67|ARAGORN|"Less than a day ahead of us. Come! [Runs
off again]
[Gimli stumbles from behind some rocks
and rolls to the ground]"|speech
68|LEGOLAS|Come, Gimli! We are gaining on them!|speech
69|GIMLI|"[Panting] I am wasted on cross-country!
We dwarves are natural sprinters! Very
dangerous over short distances!
[The trackers come over a hill and pause
as they gaze across the plains below.]"|speech
70|ARAGORN|"Rohan. Home of the horse-lords. There
is something strange at work here. Some
evil gives speed to these creatures,
sets its will against us.
[Legolas runs ahead and looks out to
the horizon.]"|speech
71|ARAGORN|Legolas, what do your Elf eyes see?|speech
72|LEGOLAS|"The Uruks turn northeast. They’re taking
the hobbits to Isengard!"|speech
73|ARAGORN|"Saruman.
[The tower of Orthanc stands amidst
the smoking caverns of Isengard. Saruman
stands in his chamber, communicating
with the Dark Lord through the Palantír.]"|speech
74|SARUMAN (V.O.)|"The world is changing. [View changes
to the tower of Barad-dûr, with its
huge Orc armies on a bridge.] Who now
has the strength to stand against the
armies of Isengard and Mordor? To stand
against the might of Sauron and Saruman
and the union of the two towers?
[Camera pans upwards along the height
of the tower of Barad-dûr until the
flaming Eye is in view.]"|speech
75|SARUMAN (V.O.)|"Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule
this Middle-earth.
[The trees around Isengard are being
ripped down, chopped up and used to
feed huge furnaces. The caverns of Isengard
glow with the fires of industry, sounds
of hammering fill the air and molten
iron is poured into casts to forge weapons.]"|speech
76|SARUMAN (V.O.)|"The old world will burn in the fires
of industry. The forests will fall.
A new order will rise. We will drive
the machine of war with the sword and
the spear and the iron fists of the
Orc. We have only to remove those who
oppose us.
[Saruman stands in the midst of a gathering
of Dunlanders.]"|speech
77|SARUMAN|"The horsemen took your land. They drove
your people into the hills to scratch
a living off rocks."|speech
78|DUNLAND MAN|Murderers!|speech
79|SARUMAN|"Take back the lands they stole from
you! Burn every village!"|speech
80|CROWD|"[Roars with approval] Argh!!
[They stomp off to destroy the villages
of Rohan as Saruman stands coldly still
among the stampede. A Rohan village
is in pandemonium as people try to escape
the on-coming pillage.]"|speech
81|SARUMAN (V.O.)|"It will begin in Rohan. Too long have
these peasants stood against you. But
no more.
[A woman with her hand on a horse calls
out to her children.]"|speech
82|MORWEN|"Éothain! Éothain! You take your sister.
You’ll go faster with just two."|speech
83|FREDA|"[As Morwen puts her onto the horse in
front of her brother] Papa says Éothain
must not ride Garulf, he is too big
for him!"|speech
84|MORWEN|"Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm. Do you understand
me?"|speech
85|ÉOTHAIN|Yes, Ma!|speech
86|FREDA|"[starts to cry] I don’t wanna leave!
I don't wanna go, Mama!"|speech
87|MORWEN|"Freda, I will find you there.
[A woman screams]"|speech
88|MORWEN|"Quickly!
[The children ride off.]"|speech
89|MORWEN|"[Looks after them] Go child!
[Dunlanders and Uruk-hai enter the village,
burning everything in sights as the
Rohirrim scream and run in all directions.
Éothain and Freda weep as they look
back from a distance.]"|speech
90|SARUMAN (V.O.)|"Rohan, my lord, is ready to fall.
[A group of horsemen ride to Edoras.
Éomer is in the lead, carrying a gravely
wounded Théodred.]
[Éowyn runs hastily up the stairs to
the Golden Hall and enters a bedchamber.
She runs to the bed.]"|speech
91|ÉOWYN|"Théodred!
[Théodred seems to hear her call but
is unable to respond. He has a bloody
gash on the side of his head. Éomer
nods to Éowyn in the direction of Théodred’s
torso. Éowyn draws back the covers and
upon seeing Théodred’s fatal wound,
her lips tighten and eyes close. She
looks up to catch Éomer’s eye.]
[Éomer and Éowyn are speaking to Théoden-king
who sits motionless on his throne, wizened,
and aged beyond his years.]"|speech
92|ÉOWYN|Your son is badly wounded, my lord.|speech
93|ÉOMER|"He was ambushed by Orcs. If we don’t
defend our country, Saruman will take
it by force."|speech
94|GRÍMA|"That is a lie! [Appears from the shadows.]
Saruman the White has ever been our
friend and ally."|speech
95|THÉODEN|"[mumbles feebly] Gríma… Gríma… [Gríma
leans down close to the King.]My son...?
Gríma...?"|speech
96|ÉOMER|"Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.
Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at
will. Orcs bearing the white hand of
Saruman. [He drops a helmet onto the
ground, which topples over to reveal
the white hand of Saruman.]"|speech
97|GRÍMA|"Why do you lay these troubles on an
already troubled mind. Can you not see?
Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent,
your war-mongering."|speech
98|ÉOMER|"War-mongering?
[Éomer grabs Gríma and pins him against
a pillar.]"|speech
99|ÉOMER|"How long is it since Saruman bought
you? What was the promised price, Gríma?
When all the men are dead you will take
your share of the treasure?
[Gríma’s eyes flicks to right, watching
Éowyn as she walks by. Éowyn stops to
stare back for a moment before departing
form the hall. Éomer jerks Gríma again
and clutches his hand around Gríma’s
jaw.]"|speech
100|ÉOMER|"Too long have you watched my sister,
too long have you haunted her steps.
[Gríma's eyes look to the left and relax
as Éomer is suddenly pulled off Gríma
by his thugs.]"|speech
101|GRÍMA|"You see much Éomer, Son of Éomund. Too
much. [The thugs punch Éomer n the stomach]
You are banished forthwith from the
kingdom of Rohan. Under pain of death!"|speech
102|ÉOMER|"[Being dragged away] Argh!!
[Uruk-hai and Orcs continue to march
across the plains with their hobbit
captives, with Aragorn, Legolas, and
Gimli hot on their pursuits.]"|speech
103|GIMLI|"Keep breathing! That’s the key! Breathe!
Ho!"|speech
104|LEGOLAS|"They’ve run as if the very whips of
their masters were behind them.
[They continue running over vast distances.
The Uruk-hai and Orcs halt at nightfall,
many panting with exertion.]"|speech
105|MORDOR ORC|"We’re not going no further till we’ve
had a breather!"|speech
106|UGLÚK|"Get a fire going!
[As the Orcs and Uruk-hai take their
rest, Pippin crawls over towards Merry.]"|speech
107|PIPPIN|Merry! Merry!|speech
108|MERRY|"[opens his eyes] I think... we might
have made a mistake leaving the Shire,
Pippin.
[A group of Orcs chops down the trees
nearby for firewood. Low groans and
rumbles start to emerge from the forest.]"|speech
109|PIPPIN|What’s making that noise?|speech
110|MERRY|"[looks towards the forest] It’s the
trees."|speech
111|PIPPIN|What?|speech
112|MERRY|"Do you remember the Old Forest? On the
borders of Buckland? Folk used to say
that there was something in the water
that made the trees grow tall... and
come alive."|speech
113|PIPPIN|Alive?|speech
114|MERRY|"Trees that could whisper. Talk to each
other. Even move."|speech
115|MAÚHUR|"I'm starving. We ain't 'ad nothin' but
maggoty bread for three stinkin' days!"|speech
116|SNAGA|"Yeah. Why can’t we have some meat? [His
eyes rest on the hobbits.] What about
them? They’re fresh."|speech
117|UGLÚK|They are not for eating!|speech
118|GRISHNÁKH|"What about their legs? They don't need
those. Ooh… They look tasty!"|speech
119|UGLÚK|"[Shoves at the Orcs] Get back, scum!
[The other Orcs are getting restless.]"|speech
120|MORDOR ORC|Carve them up!|speech
121|SNAGA|"[Moves towards the hobbits with his
blade drawn] Just a mouth full."|speech
122|UGLÚK|"No!
[Pippin and Merry recoil in fright.
Uglúk jumps on the Orc and cuts off
his head, which bounces off the hobbit's
shoulders.]"|speech
123|UGLÚK|"Looks like meat’s back on the menu,
boys!!
[The Uruk-hai and Orcs cheer and started
tearing into the fresh meat, intestines
flying, taking their eyes off the hobbits
for a while.]"|speech
124|MERRY|"Pippin, let’s go.
[Their hands still bound, the hobbits
try to crawl away. Suddenly a foot comes
down on Merry and Pippin is turned onto
his back.]"|speech
125|GRISHNÁKH|"[Brandishing a blade in front of Pippin’s
face] Go on, call for help. Squeal!
No one’s gonna save you now!
[Suddenly, a spear pierces the Orc's
back. Mayhem ensues as Riders of Rohan
burst out from their hiding places and
ambush the Orcs.]"|speech
126|MERRY|"Pippin! [Gestures for them to make their
escape.]
[The hobbits try to escape from the
pandemonium to the forest, dodging bodies
and stomping feet. Suddenly Pippin turns
onto his face and looks up to a pair
of thrashing hooves bearing down on
him.]"|speech
127|PIPPIN|"ARGH!!!
[The Three Hunters are still chasing
after the Uruk-hai. It is dawn.]"|speech
128|LEGOLAS|"[Pauses and looks up] A red sun rises.
Blood has been spilled this night.
[Camera pans over the rock and plains,
alternating between the band of Uruk-hai
and the Three Hunters giving chase.
The trackers hear the sound of horses.
Aragorn and company hide behind some
boulders. A large group of horse-men
appears, galloping quickly with their
banners flying. Aragorn comes out of
hiding as they pass, followed by Legolas
and Gimli.]"|speech
129|ARAGORN|"Riders of Rohan, what news from the
Mark?
[At a signal from Éomer at the lead,
the riders make a quick turn and head
towards them, surrounding them in ever-tightening
circles. As they stop, they point their
long spears menacingly at them.]"|speech
130|ÉOMER|"What business does an Elf, a man and
a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak
quickly!"|speech
131|GIMLI|"Give me your name, Horsemaster, and
I shall give you mine.
[Éomer hands his staff to another rider,
and gets off his horse. Aragorn puts
a hand on Gimli’s shoulder.]"|speech
132|ÉOMER|"I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if
it stood but a little higher from the
ground.
[Legolas, in a lightning fast move,
points an arrow at Éomer.]"|speech
133|LEGOLAS|"You would die before your stroke fell!
[The riders all point their spears closer
at the travellers. After a tense moment,
Aragorn pushes down Legolas’ arm.]"|speech
134|ARAGORN|"I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This
is Gimli, son of Glóin and Legolas of
the Woodland realm. We are friends of
Rohan and of Théoden, your king."|speech
135|ÉOMER|"Théoden no longer recognizes friend
from foe. [Takes off helmet] Not even
his own kin.
[The spears are withdrawn.]"|speech
136|ÉOMER|"Saruman has poisoned the mind of the
king and claimed lordship over these
lands. My company are those loyal to
Rohan. And for that, we are banished.
The White Wizard is cunning. He walks
here and there, they say, as an old
man, hooded and cloaked. And everywhere
his spies slip past our nets."|speech
137|ARAGORN|"We are not spies. We track a party of
Uruk-hai westward across the plain.
They’ve taken two of our friends captive."|speech
138|ÉOMER|"The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered
them during the night."|speech
139|GIMLI|"But there were two hobbits. Did you
see two hobbits with them?"|speech
140|ARAGORN|"They would be small – only children
to your eyes."|speech
141|ÉOMER|"We left none alive. We piled the carcasses
and burned them. [Points to a smoking
pile in the distance.]"|speech
142|GIMLI|Dead?|speech
143|ÉOMER|"[nods] I am sorry.
[Legolas puts a hand on Gimli’s shoulder
in grief. Éomer turns and whistles.]"|speech
144|ÉOMER|"Hasufel! Arod! [Two horses move up.]
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters. Farewell.
[Éomer puts on his helmet and gets back
on his horse]"|speech
145|ÉOMER|"Look for your friends. But do not trust
to hope, it has forsaken these lands.
[To the riders] We ride north!
[Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli look on
as the Riders go off. They then ride
towards the burning carcasses. Gimli
starts to shift through the smoldering
pile, and pulls out a charred belt and
dagger sheath.]"|speech
146|GIMLI|It’s one of their wee belts.|speech
147|LEGOLAS|"[with his head bowed and eyes closed]
Hiro îth… ab 'wanath... (May they find
peace in death)"|speech
148|ARAGORN|"[Kicks a helmet and yells] AAARRGGHH!!!
[He falls to his knees.]"|speech
149|GIMLI|"We failed them.
[Aragorn looks to the side as some tracks
catch his attention.]"|speech
150|ARAGORN|"A hobbit lay here, and the other. [Flashback:
Pippin yells as he looks up at a pair
of thrashing hooves bearing down on
him. He rolls over, avoiding the hooves.]
They crawled."|speech
151|[ARAGORN STARTS TO FOLLOW THE TRACKS, WITH LEGOLAS AND GIMLI BEHIND HIM. FLASHBACK|"Merry and Pippin crawl frantically away
from the battle.]"|speech
152|ARAGORN|"Their hands were bound. [Flashback:
Merry rubs his bonds furiously against
the sharp edge of a weapon.] Their bonds
were cut. [Aragorn holds up a broken
length of thick rope.]"|speech
153|ARAGORN|They ran over here. They were followed.|speech
154|[FLASHBACK|"Their hands freed, the hobbits run away
from the battle scene, dodging under
a horse and trying to stay out of harms
way. As they flee, Grishnákh grabs Pippin
by his belt and clings on.]"|speech
155|MERRY|"The belt!
[Pippin undoes his belt and Grishnákh
is left holding it.]"|speech
156|MERRY|Run!|speech
157|ARAGORN|"The tracks lead away from the battle...
[They break into a run and then stop]
into Fangorn Forest.
[The Three looks up into a dense and
dark forest]"|speech
158|GIMLI|"Fangorn. What madness drove them in
there?
[Scene moves from the trackers into
the nighttime chase of Merry and Pippin.
The hobbits run into the Fangorn, seeking
to lose the pursuing Orc. They collapse
onto the ground, out of breath.]"|speech
159|PIPPIN|"Did we lose him? [Looks around] I think
we lost him.
[Suddenly, Grishnákh appears from behind
the trees, brandishing a blade.]"|speech
160|GRISHNÁKH|"I’m gonna rip out your filthy little
innards! Come here!
[Merry and Pippin run and hide behind
a tree.]"|speech
161|MERRY|"Trees! Climb a tree!
[Pippin and Merry quickly scramble up
a tree each.]"|speech
162|MERRY|"[Looks around and then sighs in relief.]
He's gone.
[Suddenly, Merry is pulled by his legs
and falls to the ground. Grishnákh leans
over him with his menacing blade. Merry
tries to kick him off but to no avail.]"|speech
163|PIPPIN|"Merry!
[Pippin looks down in horror but as
he turns his head, he spots a pair of
gleaming yellow eyes blinking in the
tree he’s clinging to. The tree starts
to move and groan.]"|speech
164|TREEBEARD|Hooooo...|speech
165|PIPPIN|"Argh!!
[Pippin loses his grip in fright and
grabs at the air futilely as he falls.
The tree catches him before he hits
the ground.]"|speech
166|GRISHNÁKH|"Let’s put a maggot-hole in your belly.
[Suddenly he senses something behind
him and as he looks up, the tree stomps
and squashes him onto the forest floor.]"|speech
167|PIPPIN|"Run, Merry!
[Merry tries to run away but is scooped
by the tree.]"|speech
168|TREEBEARD|"[Looks at the creatures in his hands]
Little Orcs! Burárum..."|speech
169|PIPPIN|It’s talking, Merry. The tree is talking!|speech
170|TREEBEARD|"Tree?! I am no tree. I am an Ent. [Stomps
slowly through the forest.]"|speech
171|MERRY|A treeherder! A shepherd of the forest.|speech
172|PIPPIN|"Don’t talk to it, Merry. Don’t encourage
it."|speech
173|TREEBEARD|Treebeard, some call me.|speech
174|PIPPIN|And whose side are you on?|speech
175|TREEBEARD|"Side? I am on nobody’s side because
nobody’s on my side, little Orc. Nobody
cares for the woods anymore."|speech
176|MERRY|We’re not Orcs. We’re Hobbits!|speech
177|TREEBEARD|"Hobbits? Never heard of a hobbit before.
Sounds like Orc mischief to me! [Tightens
his hold on the hobbits and squeezes
them. Merry and Pippin whimpers in pain]
They come with fire, they come with
axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking,
burning! Destroyers and usurpers, curse
them!"|speech
178|MERRY|"No, you don’t understand. We’re Hobbits...
Halflings! Shirefolk!"|speech
179|TREEBEARD|"Maybe you are and maybe you aren’t.
The White Wizard will know."|speech
180|PIPPIN|The White Wizard?|speech
181|MERRY|"Saruman.
[Treebeard drops them on the ground
and the hobbits look up at the White
Wizard.]
[Following Gollum, Frodo and Sam reach
the end of Emyn Muil and see that Mordor
is now closer.]"|speech
182|GOLLUM|"See, see, we have led you out! Hurry
hobbitses hurry. Very lucky we find
you.
[Gollum jumps on a rock. Frodo walks
past, Gollum shrinks as Sam draws near.]"|speech
183|GOLLUM|"Nice hobbit. [Leaps after Frodo, putting
a wide berth between him and Sam.]
[Sam’s foot slipped into muck.]"|speech
184|SAM|"Whoa, it’s a bog! He’s led us into a
swamp!"|speech
185|GOLLUM|"A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We
will take you on safe paths through
the mist. Come, hobbits, come. We go
quickly.
[Gollum looks back and gestures for
the hobbits to follow.]"|speech
186|GOLLUM|"I found it, I did. The way through the
marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't
know it. They go round for miles and
miles. Come quickly. Swift and quick
as shadows we must be.
[The marsh lands stretch for miles and
miles as far as the eye can see. The
hobbits and Gollum appear as little
specks. As the three pick their way
gingerly though the marshes, they see
faces floating in the water, still,
rotting and pale, and flickering flames
on the swamps.]"|speech
187|SAM|"There are dead things! Dead faces in
the water!"|speech
188|GOLLUM|"All dead. All rotten. Elves and men
and orcses. A great battle long ago.
[Turns to face the hobbits.] The Dead
Marshes. Yes, yes that is their name.
This way. Don’t follow the lights.
[Sam’s foot slips again into the water.]"|speech
189|SAM|Ohh!|speech
190|GOLLUM|"Careful now, or hobbits go down to join
the dead ones and light little candles
of their own.
[Frodo is drawn to one of the faces
in Elven armour. He stares at it intently,
until suddenly its eyes open and Frodo
falls face-down into the water.]"|speech
191|SAM|"Frodo!
[Frodo is in the water and sees many
faces of the dead, no longer still but
screaming and grasping, their rotten
robes and hair flowing about their gruesome
faces. Their hands are reaching for
him. Suddenly he is grabbed from behind.
Frodo sputters and gasps for air as
Gollum pulls him out of the water.]"|speech
192|FRODO|"[Looks at Gollum in perplexed gratitude
and disbelief.] Gollum..."|speech
193|GOLLUM|Don’t follow the lights! [Crawls away]|speech
194|SAM|"[Runs to Frodo’s side.] Mr. Frodo! Are
you alright?
[Frodo lies panting, staring after Gollum]"|speech
195|[NIGHTFALL|"Sam is asleep but Frodo is still awake.
He is holding the Ring in the palm of
his hand and stroking it, mesmerized.
Suddenly he hears Gollum.]"|speech
196|GOLLUM|"Sooo bright. Sooo beautiful. [Frodo
quickly puts the Ring back inside his
shirt. He looks up to see Gollum crouching
away from him, stroking the centre of
his palm] our preciousss..."|speech
197|FRODO|What did you say?|speech
198|GOLLUM|"Master should be resting. Master needs
to keep up his strength."|speech
199|FRODO|"[Moves over and crouches in front of
Gollum] Who are you?"|speech
200|GOLLUM|"Mustn’t ask us. Not its business. *Gollum,
Gollum*"|speech
201|FRODO|"Gandalf told me you were one of the
River Folk."|speech
202|GOLLUM|"Cold be heart and hand and bone. Cold
be travellers far from home."|speech
203|FRODO|He said your life was a sad story.|speech
204|GOLLUM|"They do not see what lies ahead, when
sun has failed and moon is dead."|speech
205|FRODO|"You were not so very different from
a hobbit once, were you... Sméagol?"|speech
206|GOLLUM|"[Looks up slowly.] What did you call
me?"|speech
207|FRODO|"That was your name once, wasn’t it?
A long time ago."|speech
208|GOLLUM|"My name... My name... S... S...Sméagol…
[Suddenly, the piercing cries of the
Nazgûl are heard overhead]"|speech
209|GOLLUM|Argh!!|speech
210|SAM|Black Riders!|speech
211|GOLLUM|Hide! Hide!|speech
212|FRODO|"Argh!
[Suddenly Frodo feels the pain of the
Nazgûl's sword piercing him and the
call of the Ring. Images of the Ringwraiths
come to him in flashes.]"|speech
213|FRODO|Argh!!|speech
214|SAM|"C’mon Frodo! C'mon!
[Frodo continues to clutch at the Ring
on his chest, immobilized. Sam drags
Frodo across to hide beneath some bramble
bushes. The Nazgûl appears, tightening
his hold on the reins. Camera then shows
him riding a Fell Beast, swooping down
across the marsh lands. Chilling screams
of the Nazgûl fill the air.]"|speech
215|GOLLUM|"Quick! They will see us! They will see
us!"|speech
216|SAM|I thought they were dead!|speech
217|GOLLUM|"Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No.
[A loud screech from the Nazgûl flying
high above the marshes.]"|speech
218|GOLLUM|"[cowering] Wraiths! Wraiths on wings!
They are calling for it. They are calling
for the preciousss.
[Frodo feels the call of the Ring and
gropes for his necklace. Sam sees this
and grabs hold of Frodo’s hand.]"|speech
219|SAM|"Mr. Frodo! It’s alright. I’m here.
[The Nazgûl continues to circle overhead
and then flies off towards Mordor.]"|speech
220|GOLLUM|"Hurry, hobbits. The Black Gate is very
close.
[Scene returns to Fangorn forest. Gimli
fingers a dark stain on a leaf and brings
it to his mouth.]"|speech
221|GIMLI|[Spits] Ptui! Orc blood.|speech
222|ARAGORN|These are strange tracks.|speech
223|GIMLI|The air is so close in here.|speech
224|LEGOLAS|"This forest is old. Very old. Full of
memory... and anger.
[Groans reverberate through the forest
and Gimli raises his axe.]"|speech
225|LEGOLAS|The trees are speaking to each other.|speech
226|ARAGORN|[Whispers] Gimli!|speech
227|GIMLI|Huh?|speech
228|ARAGORN|[Gestures] Lower your axe.|speech
229|GIMLI|[Lowering his axe slowly] Oh.|speech
230|LEGOLAS|"Aragorn, nad nâ ennas! (Something is
out there.)"|speech
231|ARAGORN|"Man cenich? (What do you see?)
[Close-up of Legolas’ eyes]"|speech
232|LEGOLAS|The White Wizard approaches.|speech
233|ARAGORN|"Do not let him speak. He will put a
spell on us.
[Aragorn wraps his hand around the hilt
of his sword, Gimli tightens his hold
on his axes, and Legolas notches an
arrow to his bow.]"|speech
234|ARAGORN|"We must be quick.
[With a yell, the three swing round
to attack. Gimli’s axe and Legolas’
arrow are deflected. Aragorn drops his
sword as it becomes red hot in his grasp.
They shield their eyes with their hands
from the bright light emanating from
the White Wizard.]"|speech
235|WHITE WIZARD|"You are tracking the footsteps of two
young hobbits."|speech
236|ARAGORN|Where are they?|speech
237|WHITE WIZARD|"They passed this way the day before
yesterday. They met someone they did
not expect. Does that comfort you?"|speech
238|ARAGORN|"Who are you? Show yourself!
[The bright light dims, revealing Gandalf,
all dressed in white. The three are
astounded. Legolas and Gimli bow.]"|speech
239|ARAGORN|It cannot be. You fell.|speech
240|GANDALF|"Through fire and water. [Flashback:
Gandalf is battling the Balrog atop
Dúrin’s Tower.] From the lowest dungeon
to the highest peak, I fought with the
Balrog of Morgoth.
[Gandalf holds up Glamdring and a flash
of lightning strikes it before he plunges
the sword into the Balrog. With a final
cry, the Balrog falls from the peak
and lands, smoking, onto the icy mountainside.]"|speech
241|GANDALF|"Until at last, I threw down my enemy
and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
[On top of the mountain, Gandalf crawls
a bit and then collapses.]"|speech
242|GANDALF|"Darkness took me. And I strayed out
of thought and time. [Camera zooms in
Gandalf’s eye and enters an amorphous
realm of stars and galaxies, ending
in a blinding white light] Stars wheeled
overhead and everyday was as long as
a life-age of the earth. But it was
not the end. I felt life in me again.
[Camera zooms out from Gandalf’s eye,
lying naked and very still. His hair
has turned white and wounds are completely
healed. He suddenly shudders with a
deep gasp and pants as life returns
to him]"|speech
243|GANDALF|"I've been sent back until my task is
done."|speech
244|ARAGORN|Gandalf!|speech
245|GANDALF|"Gandalf? Yes... That's what they used
to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was
my name. [He smiles]"|speech
246|GIMLI|Gandalf!|speech
247|GANDALF|"[With a twinkle in his eye] I am Gandalf
the White. [Aragorn grins] And I come
back to you now at the turn of the tide.
[They walk through the forest, with
Gandalf leading the way, now wearing
a grey cloak over his white robes.]"|speech
248|GANDALF|"One stage of your journey is over, another
begins. War has come to Rohan. We must
ride to Edoras with all speed.
[Outside the forest, Gandalf whistles
piercingly. Soon an answering neigh
is heard and a white horse appears from
the plain, answering the call.]"|speech
249|LEGOLAS|"That is one of the Mearas, unless my
eyes are cheated by some spell.
[The horse comes round to stop in front
of Gandalf.]"|speech
250|GANDALF|"Shadowfax. [Gimli bows in the background.]
He's the lord of all horses and he's
been my friend through many dangers.
[The Three Hunters and Gandalf ride
across the plains to Edoras.]
[Back at Fangorn, Treebeard is walking
through the forest with Merry and Pippin
sitting on his shoulders.]"|speech
251|TREEBEARD|"My home lies deep in the forest near
the roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf
I would keep you safe and safe is where
I’ll keep you. The trees have grown
wild and dangerous. Anger festers in
their hearts. They will harm you if
they can. There are too few of us now.
Too few of us Ents left to manage them.
[Frodo and Sam are climbing a high rock
overlooking Morannon.]"|speech
252|GOLLUM|"The Black Gate of Mordor.
[The enormous Black Gate comes into
view with Orcs patrolling and standing
guard on the towers and atop the walls.
From the right, an army of Easterling
soldiers is marching to the Black Gate.]"|speech
253|SAM|"Oh save us. My ol' Gaffer'd have a thing
or two to say if he could see us now."|speech
254|GOLLUM|"Master says to show him the way into
Mordor, so good Sméagol does. Master
says so."|speech
255|FRODO|"I did.
[Orcs are patrolling the Black Gate.]"|speech
256|SAM|"That’s it then. We cannot get past that.
[A command is heard and an Orc sounds
a horn, signalling for the Gate to be
opened. Two enormous cave trolls stretch
and growl and then pull the mighty Gate
open.]"|speech
257|SAM|"Look! The gate, it's opening! I can
see a way down.
[He moves closer to the edge. Suddenly,
the rock underneath him gives way and
he falls.]"|speech
258|FRODO|Sam, no!|speech
259|SAM|"Argh!!
[Frodo goes after Sam.]"|speech
260|GOLLUM|"Master!
[Two Easterling soldiers see streams
of dust coming down the cliff made by
Sam and Frodo. They move away from the
troop to investigate. Frodo reaches
Sam who is stuck in the scree. As the
Easterlings move closer and closer,
Frodo throws his Elvish cloak over himself
and Sam. The soldiers are now directly
in front of Sam, but their eyes see
nothing but rock. Frodo and Sam peer
from underneath the cloak. The soldiers
soon leave and after a moment, Frodo
throws back the cloak and pulls Sam
out.]"|speech
261|FRODO|I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.|speech
262|SAM|"I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these
Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.
[They prepare to make a run for the
Gate.]"|speech
263|FRODO|"Now!
[Gollum pulls them back.]"|speech
264|GOLLUM|"No! No, no master! They catch you! They
catch you! Don’t take it to him! He
wants the preciousss. Always he’s looking
for it! And the preciousss is wanting
to go back to him. But we mustn’t let
him have it.
[Frodo tries to make a run for it.]"|speech
265|GOLLUM|"No! [Pulls Frodo back again.] There’s
another way. More secret. A dark way."|speech
266|SAM|Why haven’t you spoken of this before?!|speech
267|GOLLUM|Because Master did not ask!|speech
268|SAM|He’s up to something.|speech
269|FRODO|"Are you saying there’s another way into
Mordor?"|speech
270|GOLLUM|"Yes. There is a path, and some stairs,
and then… a tunnel."|speech
271||[Frodo and Sam watch as the Black Gate|stage direction
272|GOLLUM|"closes. Gollum is stroking Frodo’s arm
and burying his face in his cloak.]"|speech
273|FRODO|He’s led us this far, Sam.|speech
274|SAM|Mr. Frodo, no.|speech
275|FRODO|He’s been true to his word.|speech
276|SAM|[Whispers] No!|speech
277|FRODO|Lead the way, Sméagol.|speech
278|GOLLUM|"Good Sméagol always helps.
[Frodo follows Gollum as Sam stares
after him in disbelief.]
[On the plains of Rohan. Gandalf, Aragorn,
Legolas and Gimli stop as Edoras comes
into view.]"|speech
279|GANDALF|"Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.
There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan,
whose mind is overthrown. Saruman’s
hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
[In the Hall, Éowyn is kneeling before
Théoden, holding his hand in hers.]"|speech
280|ÉOWYN|"My lord, your son, he is dead. My lord?
Uncle?
[Théoden just sits and stares ahead,
his eyes clouded and unseeing.]"|speech
281|ÉOWYN|"Will you not go to him? [She weeps.]
Will you do nothing?
[Scene returns to Gandalf and company.]"|speech
282|GANDALF|"Be careful what you say. Do not look
for welcome here.
[They ride on towards Edoras.]
[At Edoras, Éowyn is weeping at the
dead Théodred's bed. She kisses his
hand. Gríma appears at the door.]"|speech
283|GRÍMA|"Oh, he… he must have died sometime in
the night. What a tragedy for the king
to lose his only son and heir.
[He sits on the bed and puts a hand
on Éowyn’s shoulder.]"|speech
284|GRÍMA|"I understand his passing is hard to
accept, especially now that your brother
has deserted you."|speech
285|ÉOWYN|"[jumps back and throws off Gríma’s hand]
Leave me alone, snake!"|speech
286|GRÍMA|"[Rises from the bed and moves ever closer
to Éowyn] Oh, but you are alone! Who
knows what you have spoken to the darkness.
In bitter watches of the night, when
all your life seems to shrink, the walls
of your bower closing in about you,
like a hutch to trammel some wild thing
in.
[He puts a hand on her cheek and moves
down to her throat.]"|speech
287|GRÍMA|"So fair, so cold, like a morning of
pale spring still clinging to winter's
chill.
[Éowyn and Gríma stare at each other
intently.]"|speech
288|ÉOWYN|"Your words are poison!
[Éowyn runs out of the hall. Weeping,
she looks away into the distance. A
flag comes off its pole and is carried
by the breeze. Éowyn sees riders coming
towards Edoras. As Aragorn passes the
entrance to Edoras, the flag floats
down to land near him. Edoras is silent
and somber. Everyone is dressed in black
and staring at the newcomers in wary
silence. Aragorn looks up at the hall
and sees a lady in white standing on
the steps. He looks around at more somber
people.]"|speech
289|GIMLI|"You’ll find more cheer in a graveyard.
[Aragorn looks up to the hall again
but the lady has disappeared. The company
climbs up the stairs to the hall and
is met by guards.]"|speech
290|GANDALF|[sees Háma] Ah.|speech
291|HÁMA|"I cannot allow you before Théoden-King
so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order
of Gríma Wormtongue.
[Gandalf nods in understanding and signals
for the others to surrender their weapons.
Aragon hands over his sword and knives.
Legolas gives a little twirl to his
knives before handing them over to the
guards. Gimli hands over his axes reluctantly.]"|speech
292|HÁMA|[gestures to Gandalf] Your staff.|speech
293|GANDALF|"Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. You
would not part an old man from his walking
stick? [Looks at Háma innocently.]
[Háma hesitates for a second and then
gestures that they follow him into the
hall. Gandalf gives Aragorn a tiny wink
and enters the hall, leaning on Legolas’
arm.]"|speech
294|GRÍMA|"[Leaning down and whispering to Théoden.]
My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.
He’s a herald of woe."|speech
295|GANDALF|"The courtesy of your hall is somewhat
lessened of late, Théoden King.
[As Gandalf approaches Théoden, Aragorn,
Legolas and Gimli pull back and survey
the hall and its hostile occupants.
A group of men starts to follow their
steps with hostility.]"|speech
296|GRÍMA|[Whispering to Théoden.] He’s not welcome.|speech
297|THÉODEN|"Why should I… welcome you, Gandalf…
Stormcrow? [Looks to Gríma for affirmation.]"|speech
298|GRÍMA|"A just question, my liege. [He walks
towards Gandalf.] Late is the hour in
which this conjurer chooses to appear.
Lathspell spell I name him. Ill news
is an ill guest."|speech
299|GANDALF|"Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind
you teeth. I have not passed through
fire and death to bandy crooked words
with a witless worm! [Raises his staff
against Gríma.]"|speech
300|GRÍMA|"His staff! [Backing away from Gandalf
while addressing the guards] I told
you to take the wizard’s staff!
[The hostile guards attack. Aragorn,
Legolas and Gimli engage them in a fist-fight
as Gandalf continues to approach Théoden.
Gamling tries to go forward but Háma
holds him back.]"|speech
301|GANDALF|"Théoden, son of Thengel, too long have
you sat in the shadows.
[Gríma tries to crawl away unnoticed,
but Gimli catches him and pins him to
the floor.]"|speech
302|GIMLI|"[Growls] I would stay still, if I were
you."|speech
303|GANDALF|"Hearken to me! I release you from the
spell. [Gestures with his hand]"|speech
304|THÉODEN|"[Menacingly] Hahahhhahahahah! [Gandalf
opens his eyes in surprise.] You have
no power here, Gandalf the Grey!
[Gandalf throws back his grey cloak,
exuding blinding white light. Théoden
is thrown back against his seat.]"|speech
305|THÉODEN|Argh!|speech
306|GANDALF|"[Points his staff towards Théoden.]
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison
is drawn from a wound.
[Éowyn rushes in. Seeing her uncle threatened,
she tries to go to him but is held back
by Aragorn.]"|speech
307|ARAGORN|Wait.|speech
308|THÉODEN|"[In Saruman’s voice.] If I go. . . Théoden
dies.
[Gandalf moves his staff sharply and
Théoden flies back against the chair
again.]"|speech
309|GANDALF|"You did not kill me, you will not kill
him!"|speech
310|THÉODEN|[in Saruman's voice] Rohan is mine!|speech
311|GANDALF|"Be gone!!
[Gandalf smites Théoden as he lunges
at him. Théoden is thrown back into
the chair and the shot changes to Saruman
flying backwards from the Palantír which
he used to manipulate Théoden. He lands
landing hard on the floor of Orthanc,
bleeding from a gash in his forehead.
In the hall, Théoden lets out a moan
and slumps forward in the chair. Éowyn
runs to her uncle’s side as he falls.
Théoden’s head rises again and his face
begins to change gradually into that
of a much younger-looking man. Clarity
and recognition returns to his eyes.]"|speech
312|THÉODEN|"[Looks closely at Éowyn] I know your
face. Éowyn… Éowyn.
[Éowyn weeps with joy]"|speech
313|THÉODEN|Gandalf?|speech
314|GANDALF|"Breathe the free air again, my friend.
[The hall is shown to be filled with
light again, as everyone marvels at
the rejuvenation of the king.]"|speech
315|THÉODEN|"[Standing up and looking around him.]
Dark have been my dreams of late. [He
looks down at his trembling hands.]"|speech
316|GANDALF|"Your fingers would remember their old
strength better... if they grasped your
sword.
[Háma runs up with his sword. Théoden
reaches for it with trembling hands.
He wraps his fingers around it slowly
and then draws it, gazing upon the shiny
steel. In a corner, Gríma trembles and
tries to escape but is pulled back by
Gimli. Suddenly, Théoden’s gaze turns
to Gríma. Gríma is thrown out of the
hall and down the stairs.]"|speech
317|GRÍMA|"Argh! [Beseechingly to Théoden] I've
only ever served you, my lord!"|speech
318|THÉODEN|"[Advancing towards Gríma, holding the
sword firmly in his hand] Your leechcraft
would have had me crawling on all fours
like a beast!"|speech
319|GRÍMA|"[Grovelling] Send me not from your side.
[Théoden raises his sword to kill Gríma.
Aragorn holds him back.]"|speech
320|ARAGORN|"No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilled on his
account.
[Gríma scrambles to his feet and pushes
through the crowd]"|speech
321|GRÍMA|Get out of my way!|speech
322|HÁMA|"Hail, Théoden king!
[The crowd kneels in homage before Théoden.
Aragorn kneels also. Gríma rides out
of Edoras. As Théoden turns to go back
into the hall, he looks up.]"|speech
323|THÉODEN|"Where is Théodred? Where is my son?
[A white flower comes into view, held
up by a hand. It is released and spirals
down to land among similar flowers,
in front of a tomb.]"|speech
324|THÉODEN|"Simbelmynë. Ever has it grown on the
tombs of my forebearers. [Looks at Gandalf]
Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
Alas, that these evil days should be
mine. The young perish and the old linger.
That I should live to see the last days
of my house."|speech
325|GANDALF|Théodred’s death was not of your making.|speech
326|THÉODEN|"No parent should have to bury their
child.
[Théoden starts to weep]"|speech
327|GANDALF|"He was strong in life. His spirit will
find its way to the halls of your fathers.
Westu hál. Ferðu, Théodred, Ferðu. (Be-thou
well. Go-thou, Théodred, go-thou.)
[Gandalf turns to go back to the hall
and leaves Théoden to grieve in private.
He spots two children on horseback.
The boy collapses and falls off the
horse. Later, inside the Golden Hall,
the two children are eating at a table,
and Éowyn is with them.]"|speech
328|ÉOWYN|"They had no warning. They were unarmed.
Now the wildmen are moving through the
Westfold, burning as they go. Rick,
cot and tree."|speech
329|FREDA|Where’s mama?|speech
330|ÉOWYN|Shh...|speech
331|GANDALF|"This is but a taste of the terror that
Saruman will unleash. All the more potent
for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.
Ride out and meet him head on. Draw
him away from your women and children.
[Leans forward and puts a hand on Théoden’s
chair. Théoden looks at his hand warily.]
You must fight."|speech
332|ARAGORN|"You have two thousand good men riding
north as we speak. Éomer is loyal to
you. His men will return and fight for
their king."|speech
333|THÉODEN|"They will be three hundred leagues from
here by now. Éomer cannot help us. I
know what it is that you want of me.
But I will not bring further death to
my people. I will not risk open war.
[Gimli takes a bite of his bread as
he watches the exchange between Aragorn
and Théoden.]"|speech
334|ARAGORN|"Open war is upon you. Whether you would
risk it or not."|speech
335|THÉODEN|"When last I looked, Théoden, not Aragorn,
was king of Rohan.
[Gimli takes a drink and burps.]"|speech
336|GANDALF|"Then what is the king’s decision?
[Scene shifts to outside Meduseld]"|speech
337|HÁMA|"By order of the king, the city must
empty. We make for the refuge of Helm’s
Deep. Do not burden yourselves with
treasures. Take only what provisions
you need.
[People are moving about, gathering
their belongings and preparing to move.
Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli
walk towards the stables.]"|speech
338|GIMLI|"Helm’s Deep! They flee to the mountains
when they should stand and fight. Who
will defend them if not their king."|speech
339|ARAGORN|"He’s only doing what he thinks is best
for his people. Helm’s Deep has saved
them in the past.
[They enter the stables]"|speech
340|GANDALF|"There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap. He thinks
he’s leading them to safety. What they
will get is a massacre. Théoden has
a strong will but I fear for him. I
fear for the survival of Rohan. He will
need you before the end, Aragorn. The
people of Rohan will need you. The defences
HAVE to hold."|speech
341|ARAGORN|They will hold.|speech
342|GANDALF|"[Turns to Shadowfax and strokes him]
The Grey Pilgrim... that’s what they
used to call me. Three hundred lives
of men I’ve walked this earth and now
I have no time. With luck, my search
will not be in vain. Look to my coming
at first light on the fifth day. At
dawn, look to the East."|speech
343|ARAGORN|"[Opens the stall gates] Go.
[Legolas jumps back as Gandalf rides
out of the stable and over the plains
of Rohan.]
[Éowyn opens a chest in which lies a
sword. She unsheathes it and begins
to practice. She swings around and is
met by Aragorn, who blocks her parry.]"|speech
344|ARAGORN|"You have some skill with a blade.
[With a swift move, Éowyn swings her
sword and renders Aragorn vulnerable,
gaining the upper hand.]"|speech
345|ÉOWYN|"[Stepping back and sheathing her sword.]
Women of this country learned long ago:
Those without swords may still die upon
them. I fear neither death nor pain."|speech
346|ARAGORN|What do you fear, my lady?|speech
347|ÉOWYN|"A cage. To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them and all chance
of valor has gone beyond recall or desire."|speech
348|ARAGORN|"You are a daughter of kings, a shieldmaiden
of Rohan. [He sheaths his knife.] I
do not think that would be your fate.
[He bows and Éowyn gazes after him as
he walks away.]
[The people of Rohan are moving out
of Edoras towards Helm’s Deep, with
Théoden leading the way. At Isengard,
Gríma confers with Saruman, holding
a cloth to his mouth.]"|speech
349|GRÍMA|"Théoden will not stay at Edoras. It’s
vulnerable, he knows this. He will expect
an attack on the city. They will flee
to Helm’s Deep, the great fortress of
Rohan. It is a dangerous road to take
through the mountains. They will be
slow. They will have women and children
with them.
[Saruman’s eyebrows rise in response.
He walks through the depths of Isengard
and gives orders to an Orc.]"|speech
350|SARUMAN|"Send out your warg riders.
[The Orc smiles. In a pit behind him,
ferocious growls are heard and shadows
dances.]
[Gollum is trying to catch a fish in
the river. He slips and falls, grasping
at a slippery fish as he goes. Frodo
and Sam follow behind.]"|speech

ahead!"|speech
352|FRODO|Why do you do that?|speech
353|SAM|What?|speech
354|FRODO|"Call him names; run him down all the
time."|speech
355|SAM|"Because… because that's what he is,
Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in 'im
but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he
wants. It's all he cares about."|speech
356|FRODO|"[Glaring at Sam] You have no idea what
it did to him. What it’s still doing
to him. [He walks past Sam and stops.]
I want to help him, Sam..."|speech
357|SAM|Why?|speech
358|FRODO|"Because I have to believe he can come
back."|speech
359|SAM|You can’t save him, Mr. Frodo.|speech
360|FRODO|"[Snapping at Sam]What do you know about
it? Nothing!
[Sam walks away slowly.]"|speech
361|FRODO|"[With remorse] I'm sorry, Sam. I don't
know why I said that."|speech
362|SAM|"[Looks back at Frodo with tears in his
eyes.] I do. It's the Ring. You can't
take your eyes off it. I've seen you.
You're not eating. You barely sleep.
It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo.
You have to fight it!"|speech
363|FRODO|"[Grows angry again] I know what I have
to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to
me! It's my task! Mine! My own! [He
walks away]"|speech
364|SAM|"Can’t you hear yourself? Don’t you know
who you sound like?
[Frodo continues to walk away without
looking back.]
[Nighttime, Frodo and Sam are asleep.
Gollum is crouching in a corner by himself.]"|speech

[Sméagol pants and then looks around.]"|speech
387|SMÉAGOL|"We... we told him to go away! And away
he goes, preciousss. [He hops around
in joy and does a little dance.] Gone,
gone, gone! Sméagol is free!
[The next day, while the hobbits were
resting, Sméagol comes back with two
rabbits and drops them onto Frodo’s
lap.]"|speech
388|SMÉAGOL|"Look! Look! See what Sméagol finds!
Hehehe! Hahaha!
[Frodo looks at up him with bloodshot
eyes. He smiles at Sméagol and looks
at Sam. Sméagol raises a fist in self-congratulation
and dances around. He then picks up
one of the rabbits and snaps the rabbit's
back in front of Frodo.]"|speech
389|SMÉAGOL|"They are young. They are tender. They
are nice. Yes they are! Eat them! Eat
them!
[He bites and tears into the raw meat.
Sam rushes over and snatches the rabbit
out of Gollum’s hands]"|speech
390|SAM|"You’ll make him sick, you will, behaving
like that! [Holding up the two rabbits]
There’s only one way to eat a brace
of coneys.

391|SMÉAGOL|"[Looking into the pot] Argh!! What’s
it doing! Stupid fat hobbit! It ruins
it!"|speech
392|SAM|"What’s to ruin? There’s hardly any meat
on ‘em.
[A faint calling sound catches the attention
of Frodo.]"|speech
393|SAM|What we need is a few good taters.|speech
394|GOLLUM|"What’s taters, preciousss? What’s taters
uh?"|speech
395|SAM|"PO-TAY-TOES! Boil ‘em. Mash ‘em. Stick
‘em in a stew. Lovely big golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish...."|speech
396|SMÉAGOL|[Sticks out his tongue in disgust] Pbbbttt!!|speech
397|SAM|"Even you couldn’t say no to that. [He
takes a sip of the stew]"|speech
398|SMÉAGOL|"Oh yes we could! Spoil nice fish...
[scrambles up close to Sam] Give it
to usss rrraw... and wrrriggling! [Makes
sickeningly happy face.] You keep nasty
chips. [Hops away]"|speech
399|SAM|"You’re hopeless.
[Frodo follows the source of the sound.
Sam suddenly notices that Frodo is no
longer in his sight.]"|speech
400|SAM|"Mr. Frodo?
[He goes in search of Frodo and finds
him lying down near some bushes looking
at a Haradrim army marching across the
land. He moves to lie low beside Frodo.
Sméagol also moves in beside Frodo.]"|speech
401|SAM|Who are they?|speech
402|GOLLUM|"Wicked men. Servants of Sauron. They
are called to Mordor. The Dark One is
gathering all armies to him. It won’t
be long now. He will soon be ready."|speech
403|SAM|Ready to do what?|speech
404|GOLLUM|"To make his war. The last war that will
cover all the world in shadow."|speech
405|FRODO|We’ve got to get moving. Come on, Sam.|speech
406|SAM|"[Suddenly grabs Frodo’s arm] Mr Frodo!
Look! It’s an Oliphaunt!

soldiers and supplies on their backs.]"|speech
407|SAM|"No one at home will believe this...
[Sméagol slips away unnoticed.]"|speech
408|FRODO|"[Looking around] Sméagol?
[Suddenly, pandemonium breaks out from
below; the soldiers are being ambushed.
Cloaked rangers are firing deadly arrows
at the soldiers and Oliphaunts from
behind bushes. One of the Oliphaunts
starts trumpeting and stomping towards
Frodo and Sam, swinging his huge trunk
and tusks. Faramir takes aim and shoots
a soldier. He falls from the Oliphaunt
and lands right behind Frodo and Sam,
dead.]"|speech
409|FRODO|"We’ve lingered here too long. Come on,
Sam!
[Frodo runs right into a Gondorian Ranger,
who grabs hold of him and throws him
onto his back. Sam sees Frodo in danger
and grapples for his sword]"|speech
410|SAM|"Ah!
[He charges at Faramir but is grabbed
by another ranger and thrown down. A
sword appears at his throat. Faramir
appears.]"|speech
411|FARAMIR|"Bind their hands.
[Meanwhile, the Rohirrim refugees are
heading towards Helm’s Deep. Gimli is
on a horse, chatting with Éowyn who
is leading it by the reins.]"|speech
412|GIMLI|"It’s true you don’t see many Dwarf women.
And in fact, they are so alike in voice
and appearance, haha that they’re often
mistaken for Dwarf men.
[Éowyn smiles and looks back at Aragorn.]"|speech
413|ARAGORN|[Gestures and whispers] It’s the beards....|speech
414|GIMLI|"And this, in turn, has given rise to
the belief that there are no Dwarf women.
And that dwarves just spring out of
holes in the ground!"|speech
415|ÉOWYN|[Laughs gaily] Hahahaha!!|speech
416|GIMLI|"Hehehe! Which is of course ridiculous…
Whoa!!
[The horse suddenly rears up and gallops
away as Éowyn loses her hold on the
reins. Gimli falls off after a short
distance and lands with a loud thump.]"|speech
417|ÉOWYN|Ooh! [She rushes forward to Gimli]|speech
418|GIMLI|"[Struggling to get up] It’s alright,
it’s alright. Nobody panic. That was
deliberate. It was deliberate.
[Éowyn helps Gimli up. She laughs as
she brushes him off and looks back at
Aragorn with the sun behind her and
the wind in her hair. At that particular
moment, Aragorn seems enchanted by Éowyn’s
light-hearted image. That night. Aragorn
could not sleep and smokes his pipe
as he thinks of Arwen.]"|speech

on his lips. As her hands moves down
to rest on the Evenstar pendant around
Aragorn’s neck, he clasps her hand in
his and they gaze into each other’s
eyes.]"|speech
428|ARWEN|"Ae ú-esteliach nad... estelio han. Estelio

that jewel."|speech

Háma and kills him.]"|speech

towards them, kicking up dust trails
as they go.]"|speech

ground! Stick together!
[She looks back at the Rohirrim and
sees Aragorn on Hasufel. They hold each
other’s gaze for a moment before Aragorn
turns to join Théoden. Éowyn departs
with the villagers in the opposite direction.]
[Legolas takes aim at the distant target
and fells a warg rider. He draws another
arrow and kills another. Just as he
reaches for a third arrow, he sees Théoden
and company approaching. He quickly
runs and mounts Arod with a smooth leap

him on horseback.]"|speech

at him.]"|speech

an Orc leans over them both. Gimli kills
him quickly, twisting his neck, and
it lands on him also. Gimli sniffs at
the Orc and makes a face. He tries to
lift both the warg and Orc off him.
Just then, another warg comes upon him
and bares its teeth, ready to strike."|speech

is knocked off Hasufel and attacked
by Sharku. Aragorn tries to kill the
warg rider but Sharku blocks his attempt
and grabs Aragorn by the neck, while
the latter is half-dragged by the warg.
In the struggle, Sharku is thrown off
and he rips the Evenstar pendant from
Aragorn’s neck as he falls. Aragorn
tries to let go of the warg but finds
his wrist tangled with the saddle straps.
He tries unsuccessfully to disentangle
himself and is dragged closer and closer
to the edge of a cliff at great speed.
The warg runs right off the cliff and
they both disappear over the edge. The
battle is winding down as the Rohirrim
finish off the last few wargs and Orcs.]"|speech

down at Sharku’s fist and finds the
Evenstar pendant. He takes it, runs
to the edge of the cliff and looks down
to see the great drop and rushing waters
below, with no sign of Aragorn. Gimli
comes to stand beside him.]"|speech
470|THÉODEN|"[To his men] Get the wounded on horses.

question.]

wall is solid rock but for a small culvert

dry substances into a vessel. Gríma
is holding a lit candle in his hand.]"|speech
488|GRÍMA|"How? How can fire undo stone? What kind
of device could bring down the wall?

takes hold of Gríma’s hand and pushes
the candle away from the vessel firmly.]"|speech

of the tower. Gríma suddenly sees and
hears the enormous armies laid out below
in neat rows and is astounded and awed.

candle aloft as he gapes at the vast
army below. A horn is sounded, announcing
the appearance of Saruman. A loud cheer
is heard from the army. Saruman raises
a hand.]"|speech

at hand!

balcony over the incredible size of
Saruman’s army, past Uruk-hai, spears,
and banners and yet more Uruk-hai. The
camera focuses back on Saruman who then
raises his hands in the air]"|speech
495|SARUMAN|"To war!!

turning him over and nuzzling him.]"|speech
504|ARAGORN|"[Mumbles] Brego… [He grabs hold of Brego’s
mane, pulls himself onto the horse and
rides slowly to Helms Deep.]
[Arwen is lying on her bed, deep in
thought.]"|speech
505|ELROND|"[Coming into her room] Arwen.
[Arwen hears him and sits up.]"|speech
506|ELROND|"Tollen i lû. I chair gwannar na Valannor.
Si bado, no círar. (Arwen, it is time.
The ships are leaving for Valinor. Go
now... before it is too late.)"|speech
507|ARWEN|I have made my choice.|speech
508|ELROND|"He is not coming back. Why do you linger
here when there is no hope?"|speech
509|ARWEN|There is still hope.|speech
510|ELROND|"[Walks towards window and looks out]
If Aragorn survives this war, you will
still be parted. If Sauron is defeated,
and Aragorn made king and all that you
hope for comes true, you will still
have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay
of time, Aragorn will die.
[Arwen sees a vision of her future as
Elrond speaks. She is dressed as a queen
in mourning garb and looking down upon
Aragorn, a crown on his brow, Andúril
in his hand, and dead. Mourners are
walking around the altar, paying their
final respects. Arwen is weeping.]"|speech
511|ELROND|"And there will be no comfort for you.
No comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
He will come to death, an image of the
splendor of the kings of men in glory
undimmed before the breaking of the
world.
[The body of Aragorn is now cast as
a monument in stone. Arwen stands before
the monument, veiled and in black.]"|speech
512|ELROND|"But you, my daughter, you will linger
on in darkness and in doubt. As nightfall
in winter that comes without a star.
Here you will dwell, bound to your grief,
under the fading trees, until all the
world is changed and the long years
of your life are utterly spent.
[Still veiled in black, Arwen is walking
alone through the deserted woods of
Lothlórien.]"|speech
513|ELROND|"[Tuning to Arwen] Arwen... there is
nothing for you here, only death.
[The vision ends and Arwen weeps with
sadness and fear. Elrond comes to sit
beside his daughter and raises a hand
to her cheek.]"|speech
514|ELROND|"A im, ú-'erin veleth lîn? (Do I not
also have your love?)"|speech
515|ARWEN|"[Crying and moving into her father’s
embrace] Gerich meleth nîn, ada. (You
have my love, father)
[Elves, cloaked and carrying a lantern
each, are setting off from Rivendell
on their journey to the West. Elrond
looks on as Arwen leaves with them.
Arwen turns back to look at her father
one last time before she departs. Elrond
continues to stare after her with an
expression of resigned sadness.]
[Elrond is standing by a window. He
hears Galadriel speaking.]"|speech
516|GALADRIEL|"I amar prestar aen... han mathon ne

I feel it in the water, I feel it in
the earth, I smell it in the air.) The
power of the enemy is growing. [Saruman
is communicating with Sauron via the
Palantír.] Sauron will use his puppet
Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
Isengard has been unleashed. [View of
Saruman's marching army] The eye of
Sauron now turns to Gondor, the last
free kingdom of men. [View of Osgiliath]
His war on this country will come swiftly.
He senses the Ring is close. The strength
of the Ringbearer is failing. In his
heart, Frodo begins to understand. [Close-up
of Galadriel] The quest will claim his
life. You know this. You have foreseen
it. It is the risk we all took.
[Close-up of the Ring spinning in slow
motion]"|speech
517|GALADRIEL (V.O.)|"In the gathering dark, the will of the
Ring grows strong. It works hard now
to find its way back into the hands
of men.

with the captured Frodo and Sam.]"|speech
518|GALADRIEL (V.O.)|"Men, who are so easily seduced by its
power. The young captain of Gondor has
but to extend his hands, take the Ring
for his own and the world will fall.
It is close now, so close to achieving
its goal.
[Faramir and company have reached Henneth
Annûn. Frodo and Sam and being carries,
blinded-folded into the cave.]"|speech
519|GALADRIEL (V.O.)|"For Sauron will have dominion of all
life on this Earth, even unto the ending
of the world. The time of the Elves
is over.

with their deep pools of wisdom. We
then see Elrond in his library, looking
at the painting of Isildur facing down
Sauron with the broken blade of Narsil.]"|speech
520|GALADRIEL (V.O.)|"Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?
Do we let them stand alone?

is conferring with his man. They unroll
a map.]"|speech
521|FARAMIR|What news?|speech
522|MADRIL|"Our scouts report Saruman has attacked
Rohan. Théoden’s people have fled to
Helm’s Deep. [Points at the map] But
we must look to our own borders. Faramir,
Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshalling
an army. Easterlings and Southrons are
passing through the Black Gate."|speech
523|FARAMIR|How many?|speech
524|MADRIL|Some thousands. More come every day.|speech
525|FARAMIR|Who’s covering the river to the north?|speech
526|MADRIL|"We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but
if the city is attacked, we won’t hold
it."|speech
527|FARAMIR|"[Tracing on the map] Saruman attacks
from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The
fight will come to men on both fronts.
Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us
soon. And he will strike hard. He knows
now we do not have the strength to repel
him.
[The hobbits are unbound and blindfolds
taken off them by Damrod and another
ranger. Sam and Frodo find themselves
in a cave behind a waterfall, with Damrod
sitting behind them on a rock constantly
watching them. Faramir comes up to them
and sits.]."|speech
528|FARAMIR|My men tell me that you are Orc spies.|speech

you?
[Frodo and Sam remain silent.]"|speech
531|FARAMIR|Speak.|speech

gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured
look."|speech
536|FRODO|"[The merest hesitation.] There was no
other.
[Sam looks shifty-eyed and uncomfortable.]"|speech
537|FRODO|"We set out from Rivendell with seven
companions. One we lost in Mória. Two
were my kin. A Dwarf there was also,
and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son
of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor."|speech
538|FARAMIR|[Intently] You’re a friend of Boromir?|speech
539|FRODO|Yes... for my part.|speech
540|FARAMIR|"It will grieve you then to learn that
he is dead."|speech
541|FRODO|[Shocked] Dead? How? When?|speech
542|FARAMIR|"As one of his companions, I’d hoped
you would tell me. [Pause] He was my
brother.
[Faramir is sitting alone, deep in thought.
Suddenly someone comes up to him.]"|speech
543|GONDORIAN RANGER|"Captain Faramir. [whispers] We found
the third one.
[Frodo and Sam are sleeping. Frodo awakens
as Faramir stands before him.]"|speech
544|FARAMIR|"You must come with me. Now.
[Frodo gets up and follow. They come
to the edge of the waterfall, overlooking
the Forbidden Pool.]"|speech
545|FARAMIR|"[Pointing down] Down there.
[Frodo looks down and sees Gollum diving
into the water.]"|speech
546|FARAMIR|"To enter the forbidden pool bears the
penalty of death. [He gestures to archers
hidden in the bushes.] They wait for
my command.
[The Rangers notch their arrows]"|speech
547|FARAMIR|"Shall I shoot?
[Frodo looks stricken. Gollum emerges
from the pool onto a rock. He holds
a fish in his hand and starts singing,
slapping the fish on the rock as he
goes.]"|speech
548|GOLLUM|"[singing] The rock and pool is nice
and cool, so juicy sweet! I only wish
[Whacks the fish on the rock] to catch
a fish [whacks], so juicy sweet! [The
fish almost wriggles out of his grasp
and he whacks it some more.]
[Faramir has his hand raised to order
his men to shoot. At the last moment,
Frodo calls out.]"|speech
549|FRODO|"Wait! [Faramir stops] This creature
is bound to me. And I to him. He is
our guide. Please, let me go down to
him.
[Faramir nods. Frodo descends to the
Forbidden Pool and approaches Gollum
who is gorging on the raw fish.]"|speech
550|FRODO|"Sméagol. [Gollum turns round at Frodo’s
voice.] Master is here. Come, Sméagol.
Trust master. Come!

him.]"|speech
551|GOLLUM|We must go now?|speech
552|FRODO|"Sméagol, you must trust master. Follow
me, come on. Come. Come, Sméagol. Nice
Sméagol. That’s it. Come on.
[With the fish between his teeth, Gollum
follows Frodo warily. Suddenly he looks
up in alarm and is caught by Rangers.]"|speech
553|FRODO|"Don’t hurt him! Sméagol don’t struggle!
Sméagol listen to me!"|speech
554|GOLLUM|"[wails] Master!!
[A black cloth is brought over Gollum's
head. Frodo stares after them with a
stricken expression as Faramir leads
Gollum and his men away. Back in the
cave, Gollum is thrown down to the ground.
Crying, he crawls into a corner and
curls up into ball.]"|speech
555|GOLLUM|No! No!|speech
556|FARAMIR|Where are you leading them? Answer me!|speech

tricksy. I told you he was false."|speech

Frodo are alone.]"|speech

Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring,
Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on.
Disappear."|speech
568|FRODO|"I can’t. You were right, Sam. You tried
to tell me, but… I’m sorry. The Ring’s
taking me Sam. If I put it on, he’ll
find me. He’ll see."|speech
569|SAM|"Mr. Frodo...
[They both stand as Faramir enters.]"|speech
570|FARAMIR|"[Unsheathes his sword] So... this is
the answer to all the riddles. Here
in the wild I have you. Two halflings
and a host of men at my call. The Ring
of power within my grasp.
[Faramir lifts the Ring from Frodo's
neck with the tip of his sword.]"|speech
571|FARAMIR|"A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,
to show his quality.
[Frodo is backed up fearfully against
the wall. The Ring whispers and Frodo
falls into a trance. Suddenly, he grabs
the Ring in his hand and jerks himself
away.]"|speech
572|FRODO|No!! [He runs away from Faramir]|speech
573|SAM|"Stop it! Leave him alone! Don’t you
understand? He’s got to destroy it.
That’s where we’re going. Into Mordor.

Damrod enters.]"|speech
574|DAMROD|"Osgiliath is under attack. They call
for reinforcements."|speech
575|SAM|"Please. It’s such a burden. Will you
not help him?"|speech

577|FARAMIR|"Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to
Gondor. [He turns to leave.]
[Sam looks after Faramir sadly.]
[Aragorn is riding towards Helm’s Deep.
On the way, he sees an enormous Uruk-hai
army marching with great speed. He quickly
makes haste towards Helm’s Deep and
soon sees the refuge.]"|speech

Brego, mellon nîn. (Well done, Brego,
my friend)

of all.]"|speech
579|REFUGEES|He’s alive!|speech
580|GIMLI|"[Pushing his way through the crowd.]
Where is he? Where is he? Get out of
the way. I’m gonna kill him! [He sees
Aragorn.] You are the luckiest, the
canniest and the most reckless man I
ever knew! [He hugs Aragorn.] Bless
you, laddie!"|speech
581|ARAGORN|"Gimli, where is the king?
[Gimli gestures to the hall. As Aragorn
makes his way in, he runs into Legolas
who stands waiting.]"|speech
582|LEGOLAS|"Le ab-dollen. (You’re late.) [They smile.
Legolas pauses and looks at Aragorn’s
wounds.] You look terrible.
[To the side, Éowyn sees Aragorn and
smiles joyously and with relief. Legolas
takes Aragorn’s hand and gives the Evenstar
pendant. Aragorn looks at the Evenstar
and claps Legolas on the shoulder.]"|speech
583|ARAGORN|"Hannon le. (Thank you.)
[Éowyn looks on and smiles even as tears
fill her eyes.]

with Théoden]"|speech

585|ARAGORN|All Isengard is emptied|speech
586|THÉODEN|How many?|speech
587|ARAGORN|Ten thousand strong at least.|speech
588|THÉODEN|Ten thousand?!|speech
589|ARAGORN|"It is an army bred for a single purpose:
to destroy the world of men. They will
be here by nightfall."|speech

[Along the passage behind the Deeping
Wall.]"|speech
591|THÉODEN|"[to Gamling] I want every man and strong
lad able to bear arms to be ready for
battle by nightfall.
[Gamling nods and goes off. Théoden
stands at the gate of Helm’s Deep, speaking
to Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.]"|speech
592|THÉODEN|"We will cover the causeway and the gate
from above. No army has ever breached
the Deeping Wall or set foot inside
the Hornburg."|speech
593|GIMLI|"This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.
These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick
and their shields broad."|speech
594|THÉODEN|"I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.
I know how to defend my own keep.
[Gimli seems miffed. Legolas claps a
hand on Gimli’s shoulder as he follows
Aragorn and Théoden back in.]"|speech
595|THÉODEN|"They will break upon this fortress like
water on rock. Saruman’s hordes will
pillage and burn, we’ve seen it before.
Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt.
Within these walls, we will outlast
them."|speech
596|ARAGORN|"They do not come to destroy Rohan’s
crops or villages. They come to destroy
its people. Down to the last child."|speech
597|THÉODEN|"[Draws close to Aragorn] What would
you have me do? Look at my men. Their
courage hangs by a thread. If this is
to be our end, then I would have them
make such an end as to be worthy of
remembrance."|speech
598|ARAGORN|"Send out riders, my lord. You must call
for aid."|speech
599|THÉODEN|"And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We
are not so lucky in our friends as you.
The old alliances are dead."|speech
600|ARAGORN|Gondor will answer.|speech
601|THÉODEN|"Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold
fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies
closed in around us? Where was Gon…
– No, my lord Aragorn, we are alone.

Get the women and children into the
caves."|speech
602|GAMLING|"We need more time to lay provisions
for a siege, lord –"|speech
603|THÉODEN|"[Cutting him off] There is no time.
War is upon us!"|speech
604|ROHAN CAPTAIN|"[to the soldiers] Secure the gate!
[Men rush to prepare for battle as flocks
of carrion crows circle overhead.]
[Treebeard walks through the forest
carrying Merry and Pippin. He comes
to a clearing and stops.]"|speech
605|TREEBEARD|"We Ents have not troubled about the
wars of men and wizards for a very long

age... Ent Moot."|speech

607|TREEBEARD|'Tis a gathering.|speech
608|MERRY|"A gathering of what?
[Merry and Pippin turns round as they
hear movement from the forest around
them. They see many more Ents like Treebeard
gathering.]"|speech
609|TREEBEARD|"Beech, oak, chestnut, ash... Good, good,
good. Many have come. Now we must decide
if the Ents will go to war.
[Merry licks his lips in anticipation.]
[Back at Helm’s Deep, the women and
children are being led into the caves.]"|speech
610|SOLDIER 1|Move back! Move to the caves!|speech
611|SOLDIER 2|Keep moving!|speech
612|SOLDIER 3|"Quickly now!
[Old men and young lads are being drafted
for war. The women and children say
their tearful and reluctant farewells
as their fathers, husbands and sons
are led away by soldiers. In the armoury,
weapons are being distributed. Aragorn
picks up a battered sword, looks at
it and tosses it back.]"|speech
613|ARAGORN|"Farmer, farriers, stable boys. These
are no soldiers."|speech
614|GIMLI|Most have seen too many winters.|speech
615|LEGOLAS|"Or too few. Look at them. They’re frightened.
I can see it in their eyes. [The men
around them fell silent. Legolas speaks
to Aragorn.] Boe a hûn: neled herain

Three hundred against ten thousand!)"|speech

and then walks away. Legolas makes as
if to go after him.]"|speech
619|GIMLI|"[Puts a hand on Legolas] Let him go,
lad. Let him be.

622|GAMLING|You are our king, sire.|speech
623|THÉODEN|And do you trust your king?|speech
624|GAMLING|"[Puts armour onto Théoden] Your men,
my lord, will follow you to whatever
end.
[The villagers are handed their weapons.
An oversized helmet is placed on a wide-eyed
boy. Another stares at the axe that
he is handed with frightened eyes. Another
child wearing oversized chain mail takes
up a huge shield. Théoden stands inside
the main hall of the keep, his back
to the entrance where a bright white
light is streaming through.]"|speech
625|THÉODEN|"To whatever end… Where is the horse
and the rider? Where is the horn that
was blowing? They have passed like rain
on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow.
The days have gone down in the west.
Behind the hills, into shadow. How did
it come to this?
[Everyone is getting ready for war at
the battlements. Aragorn is sitting
on the steps. He sees a young lad in
armour holding a sword looking around
nervously.]"|speech
626|ARAGORN|Give me your sword. What is your name?|speech
627|HALETH|"Haleth, son of Háma, my lord. The men
are saying that we will not live out
the night. They say that it is hopeless..
[Aragorn gives the battered sword a
few swings.]"|speech
628|ARAGORN|"This is a good sword, Haleth, son of
Háma.
[He hands the sword back to Haleth and
leans close to him, putting a hand on
his shoulder.]"|speech
629|ARAGORN|"There is always hope.
[Back at the armoury, Aragorn dons his
battle gear. His sword is handed to
him as he reaches for it. He nods and
accepts the sword from Legolas.]"|speech
630|LEGOLAS|"We have trusted you this far. You have
not led us astray. Forgive me. I was
wrong to despair."|speech
631|ARAGORN|"Ú-moe edhored, Legolas. (There is nothing
to forgive, Legolas.)
[They smile and clap one another on
the shoulders. They look at Gimli as
he walks up to them, struggling with
his chain mail.]"|speech
632|GIMLI|"If we had more time I’d get this adjusted.
[He drops the bundle and the chain mail
lands with its length right to the floor.]
It’s a little tight across the chest.
[Aragorn and Legolas bite back smiles.
Just then, a horn sounds in the background]"|speech
633|LEGOLAS|"That is no Orc horn. [They run out to
the battlements.]
[The guards look down in wonderment.]"|speech
634|BEREG|"[to another guard] Send for the king.
Open the gate!"|speech
635|SOLDIER|"Open the gate!
[An army of Lothlórien Elves march up
the Causeway into the Hornburg. They
are led by Haldir. The Rohirrim soldiers
look upon them in wonderment and delight
as they pass.]"|speech
636|THÉODEN|How is this possible?|speech
637|HALDIR|"I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.
An alliance once existed between Elves
and men. Long ago we fought and died
together. [He looks up to see Aragorn,
Legolas and Gimli running down the steps,
and smiles] We come to honor that allegiance."|speech
638|ARAGORN|"[He bows] Mae govannen, Haldir. (Welcome,
Haldir) [He grabs Haldir in a huge embrace.
Initially stunned, Haldir hugs him back
lightly.]"|speech
639|ARAGORN|"You are most welcome!
[Legolas and Haldir clasp each other
on the shoulder.]"|speech
640|HALDIR|"[Turning to Théoden] We are proud to
fight alongside men, once more.
[Men and Elves are in their positions
on the battlements of Helm’s Deep. The
sounds of a marching army move closer
and closer. The women and children in
the caves hear the sounds overhead and
are frightened. Mothers draw their children
close and try to sooth crying babies.
The men and Elves look out into the
darkness, lit by the thousands of torches
carried by the huge advancing Uruk-hai
army and the light bouncing off their
armour. With a row of Elf archers, Gimli
is standing beside Legolas behind a
wall, only the top of his helmet visible.]"|speech
641|GIMLI|"[Grumbling and straining to look above
the wall.] You could have picked a better
spot.
[Legolas smirks. Aragorn approaches
and stands beside them]"|speech
642|GIMLI|"Well lad, whatever luck you live by,
let’s hope it lasts the night.
[Thunder sounds and lightning flashes,
revealing the sea of approaching Uruk-hai.]"|speech
643|LEGOLAS|Your friends are with you, Aragorn.|speech
644|GIMLI|"Let’s hope they last the night.
[The marching and thumping grows louder
and louder. Lightning flashes and it
begins to rain. While the Uruk-hai army
continues to march at the fortress,
an Uruk-hai leader steps on a rock outcrop.]
[Aragorn is giving commands to the Elf
warriors.]"|speech
645|ARAGORN|"A Eruchîn, ú-dano i faelas a hyn an
uben tanatha le faelas! (Show them no
mercy! For you shall receive none!)
[The Uruk-hai leader raises his swords
and commands his army to stop with a
terrifying animalic cry. The Uruks stop
and growl in anticipation of the upcoming
battle and slaughter]"|speech
646|GIMLI|"[Jumping and straining to see] What’s
happening out there?"|speech
647|LEGOLAS|"Shall I describe it to you? [Looks at
Gimli with a grin] Or would you like
me to find you a box?"|speech
648|GIMLI|"[Laughs good-naturedly] Hehehehe!!
[The Uruk Leader cries out once, encouraging
the Uruk-hai to start roaring and thumping
their spears furiously.The women and
children in the caves huddle together
in fear. Suddenly, Aldor, the old man
next to Haleth, loses his grip and releases
his arrow prematurely, shooting an Uruk-hai
in the neck.]"|speech
649|ARAGORN|"Dartho! (Hold!)
[The Uruk-hai army stop their roaring
and thumping. With a hollow groan, the
Uruk that was shot collapsed to the
ground. The other Uruk-hai bare their
teeth and roar with anger. With a cry,
the Uruk-hai leader thrusts his weapon
in the air and the Uruk-hai army starts
charging.]"|speech
650|THÉODEN|So it begins.|speech

killing many.]"|speech

655|THÉODEN|Give them a volley.|speech
656|GAMLING|[to the men] Fire!|speech
657|MAN-WITH-MISSING-EYE|"Fire!

army keep advancing, with more replacing
those fallen.]"|speech

onto the walls, pushing them up with
their long spears.]"|speech

for combat. The first ladders are almost
reaching the walls with big nasty Uruk
Berserkers on top of them.]"|speech

climbing over the wall, whacking it
in the groin with his axe and killing
it as it falls.]"|speech
666|LEGOLAS|"[Fires two arrows] Nineteen!
[The Ent Moot is still in progress.
The Ents sway a little as they continue
to deliberate. Merry and Pippin are
sitting a distance away. Suddenly, Treebeard
nods and turns to the hobbits.]"|speech

his eyes closed.]"|speech

Have you come to a decision about HIM?"|speech

need our help! They cannot fight this
war on their own."|speech
675|TREEBEARD|"War, yes… It affects us all. But you
must understand, young hobbit. It takes
a loong time to say anything in ooold…
Entish. [Merry and Pippin roll their
eyes in disgruntlement.] And we never
say anything… unless it is worth taking
a looong… time to say.

two ladders, hacking away at Uruk-hai
as they come up]"|speech
676|GIMLI|"Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty!
Twenty-one! Twenty-two!

and turns to the Causeway. A group of
Uruk-hai is advancing on the Causeway
towards the gate in tortoise formation,
using their broad shields to block off
attacks.]"|speech
677|ARAGORN|"Na fennas! (Causeway!) [Directs the
Elf archers to aim at the Uruk-hai column.]

The Uruk-hai at the sides are shot and
fall down the Causeway. But the column
keeps advancing.]"|speech
678|THÉODEN|"Is this it? Is this all you can conjure,
Saruman?
[At the bottom of the Deeping Wall,
two spiky bombs are lodge in the sluice
gate. The rest opens a path and an Uruk-hai
carrying a torch starts to run towards
the sluice gate. Aragorn spots the Uruk-hai.]"|speech

Legolas!) [Legolas shoots the Uruk-hai
in the shoulder but the latter keeps
going] Dago hon! Dago hon! (Kill him!
Kill him!)
[Legolas shoots the Uruk again. It stumbles
and then throws it self and the torch
at the bombs. An enormous explosion
is set off, blowing away a large part
of the wall. Rock, debris and bodies
are thrown up. Aragorn is also thrown
back by the force of the explosion and
on the ground, knocked out. Théoden
looks on in shock as the Uruk-hai streams
in past the Deeping Walls.]"|speech
680|THÉODEN|"Brace the Gate! Hold them! Stand firm!

with Aragorn in their path. With a cry,
he jumps down from the wall and lands
on the Uruk-hai army, taking them out
as he stands.]"|speech
681|GIMLI|"Aragorn!! Argh!
[He is soon overpowered. Aragorn gets
up and sees Gimli falling.]"|speech
682|ARAGORN|"Gimli! [He yells to the Elves behind
him] Hado i philinn! (Hurl the arrows!)
[The arrows take out the first group
of Uruk-hai coming through the hole
in the wall.]"|speech
683|ARAGORN|"Herio! (Charge!)
[Aragorn leads the Elves in a charge
towards the Uruk-hai streaming in. He
rushes to Gimli’s side and picks him
up. At the top of the battlements, Legolas
grabs a shield and sends it sliding
across the ground. He then hops onto
it and surfs down the steps, releasing
three arrows as he goes, and kicking
the shield to stab an Uruk-hai as he
lands at the bottom.]

But your part in this tale is over.
Go back to your home.
[Merry is putting on his jacket. Pippin
approaches him slowly]"|speech
689|PIPPIN|"Maybe Treebeard’s right. We don’t belong
here, Merry. It's too big for us. What
can we do in the end? We've got the
Shire. Maybe we should go home."|speech
690|MERRY|"[Looking into the distance.] The fires
of Isengard will spread. And the woods
of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.
And all that was once green and good

Pippin and puts a hand on his shoulder]
There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

and looks down as his wound in seeming
disbelief. An Uruk-hai comes up from
behind him unnoticed and slices him
on the neck. As Haldir goes down, he
looks around him and sees his kin fallen
among dead Uruk-hai.]"|speech
696|ARAGORN|"[Sees Haldir falling] HALDIR!! [He runs
up the steps to Haldir’s side and catches
him and he collapses. Haldir's head
rolls back, his eyes empty and unseeing.

he goes.]"|speech

the gate, which is under heavy attack.
The Uruk-hai are knocking down the gate
and hacking through the broken wood.
Théoden stabs at an Uruk-hai and receives
a lance in his shoulder, blocked by
his armour. Grimacing in pain, Théoden
continues to stab at the Uruk until
led away by Gamling.]"|speech

the gate.]"|speech

enormous hooks over the battlements.

a stop.] Turn around. Turn around. Take
us south!"|speech

from harm. It’s the last thing he’ll
expect."|speech

the mountains. But they will not get
far. The Uruk-hai are too many."|speech

through Helm's Deep as Gimli blows with
gusto.]"|speech

keep into the Hornburg, slashing away
at the Uruk-hai as they go. Without
pause, they storm out of the gate and
down the Causeway, right into the column

779|ÉOMER|"To the king!
[The Rohirrim and the White Rider charge
down the slope. Half the Uruk-hai army
turns to face the challenge, bearing
their spears down towards the riders.
As the riders draw closer, the sun rises
behind them, momentarily blinding the
Uruk-hai who raise the hands (and spears)
to shield their eyes. The riders crash
right into the Uruk-hai and engage them
in battle.]
[The Ents are stomping over Isengard,
swinging their huge limbs, throwing
and stamping on Orcs and rolling huge
boulders over the ground. An Ent is
pulled down with chains by some Orcs,
who immediately jump on and hacks away
at his wooden limbs. Saruman rushes
out onto the balcony of Orthanc and
stares at the pandemonium in incredulity.
Merry and Pippin also throws stones
at Orcs, their aims true.]"|speech
780|PIPPIN|Yes!|speech
781|TREEBEARD|"A hit. A fine hit!
[Two Ents rock a wooden structure and
push it over into the caverns below,
smashing against the rock. Some Orcs
fire flamed-tipped arrows at an Ent,
setting him on fire. Saruman continues
to look about from his balcony, helpless.
Some Ents are now breaking away at a
dam.]"|speech
782|TREEBEARD|"Break the dam! Release the river!

up to see the river rushing down the
slope towards Isengard, washing away
Orcs and wooden structures in its path."|speech
783|MERRY|"Pippin, hold on! [The hobbits tighten
their hold on top of Treebeard]"|speech
784|TREEBEARD|"Hold on, little hobbits!
[Treebeard braces himself against the
flood. As the water rushes over Isengard,
an Ent rushes in and thrusts his burning
body into the water. The water rushes
into the caverns, washing away the bridges,
mechanisms and structures within.]

corner. Gondorian Rangers are still
running about, defending their stations.]"|speech
785|SAM|What are you doing? Where are you going?!|speech
786|[SLOW MOTION|"Frodo walks up some stairs and stands
on a bridge. A Nazgûl on a Fell beast
emerges in front of him. Frodo stares
at the Nazgûl, fixated. Feeling the
call of the Ring, he holds it up. Faramir
watches the unfolding tableau from below.
As Frodo moves to put the Ring on his
finger and the Nazgûl flies closer and
closer, Sam runs up and knocks Frodo
over. Faramir releases an arrow and
shoots the Fell Beast. Frodo and Sam
roll down the stairs. As they come to
a stop at the bottom, Frodo holds Sam
in a death grip, yells and points Sting
at his throat, his eyes livid with madness
and anger that someone would try to
take the Ring away.]"|speech

788|SAM|"[With tears running down his face] It’s
me. It’s your Sam. Don’t you know your

to Frodo’s eyes. He realises what he
nearly did and is overcome. Stumbling
backwards, he collapses against a wall
and Sting falls to the ground with a
clang. Sam gets up slowly.]"|speech
789|FRODO|"[Slowly and with despair] I can’t do
this, Sam."|speech
790|SAM|"[Getting up slowly] I know. It’s all
wrong. By rights we shouldn’t even be
here. But we are. [He stands and leans
against a wall, looking out into the
distance.] It’s like in the great stories,
Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered.
Full of darkness and danger they were.
And sometimes you didn’t want to know
the end. Because how could the end be
happy? [Images of the riders winning
the battle against the Uruk-hai at Helm’s
Deep] How could the world go back to
the way it was when so much bad had
happened?"|speech

his sword with a victorious cry]"|speech
792|SAM|"But in the end, it’s only a passing
thing, this shadow. [The women and children
welcome the men as they return. Éowyn

is flooded. Merry and Pippin looks on
from their perch on Treebeard. On the
balcony, Saruman stumbles back into
his chamber] And when the sun shines
it will shine out the clearer. Those
were the stories that stayed with you.
That meant something, even if you were
too small to understand why. But I think,
Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now.

towards the Mountain of Fire in the
distance.]"|speech
