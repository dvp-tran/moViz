1||EXT. AN IMPOSSIBLE EXPANSE OF MARYLAND FARMLAND - DAY|location|||
2||"The wind rustles the endless field of corn, blows over the
freshly mown meadow of soybeans, and magically sways a copse of
trees.
It's a Fall after-noon. A SUDDEN POUNDING OF GALLOPING HOOVES
breaks the peace and... A HORSE and RIDER burst between the rows
of corn into the meadow.  They are running for their lives.
CLOSE ON:
The rider is a bride -- a beautiful woman dressed in a
disheveled wedding gown, it's train tattered and flying like a
knight's banner out behind her. This is MAGGIE CARPENTER.
The horse is frothing and wild-eyed, like the bride, who turns
to look behind her in terror.  The horse's labored breathing
mingles with Maggie's panicked gasps.
We see a WEDDING BOUQUET fly into a ditch as the horse thunders
on.  Maggie clings to the reins.  She looks as though she is
running from the devil himself.

SHOCKED WEDDING GUESTS rise in horror, as she runs from this
first wedding.  She drags the train boy up the second aisle as
she leaves.  Ike hangs up.  He gets up to pick up the remote and
then sits back down to watch.
The tape fast-forwards to the next wedding.  Now Ike is looking
at a much more relaxed, hipper, backyard wedding.  It says,
""Gill Chavez Wedding"".  He hits the fast-forward button
(sometimes slowing down).
ON TV:
We see the Carpenter's backyard.  It is Gill and Maggie's
wedding day.  The yard is crowded with a MIXTURE of Hells
Angels-types, Deadheads and townspeople.  The ""altar"" is a band
platform against the back fence.
Gill is waiting on the platform with a rock combo playing
Grateful Dead-type music.  He makes an introductory speech.
Maggie steps out onto the back porch.  She's beautiful in a
hippie-type wedding ensemble.  She walks with her father to a
trampoline.  We can see her tattoo.  She jumps on the trampoline,
then dives into the crowd.  They watch her and body surf her
over their heads to the back fence.
As she hits the stage, she looks at Peggy and Gill, then decides
to go.  She jumps off the stage and runs up to a passing GUY on
a dirt bike.  She jumps on and turns and waves as she rides
away.  During the video, Ike scribbles: ""Gill Chavez"".  Maggie
goes off on dirt bike.  The tape fast-forwards to the last of
Maggie's fiascoes.
ON IKE'STV
He now sees the third wedding.  It's outdoors, in a tree lined
area, MUSICIANS plays.  Ike laughs as he discovers that Maggie
approaches the altar on horseback, in a simple white dress,
wearing a crown of flowers.  The Maid Marian look.  Ike slows the
tape.
ON TV:  IT SAYS, ""GEORGE SWILLING WEDDING"".
As Maggie rides down the aisle, suddenly the horse whinnies!
Maggie has kicked it in the shins.  It rears and bolts,
galloping off with the bride.  Ike FREEZE FRAMES the tape on an
image of Maggie, hair blowing.  Although she is panic-stricken,
her soul seems to shine through in tat single frame.  As Ike
stares at her, the smirk fades from his face.  He just looks at
her, allowing himself to see her expression, her eyes.  He can't
help it.
She gets to him.  Ike gets a restless look on his face.  He

Maggie stops her walk, gives Ike a teasing smile, and then
resumes with her walk toward him.  His face.  Her face.  His
face.  Her face.
CLOSE ON:
Her foot inches forward.  The other follows.

smiles at her.  She smiles at him.  She is almost there... She's
there, smiling at Ike.  The Pastor gestures to the guests to sit
down.  They do.

Ike sneezes.  She looks down and imagines she sees the carpet
splitting apart.  And she bolts like a bat out of hell!  In a
