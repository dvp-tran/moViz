adjustments to their carriage. The LANDLORD hovers, waiting
for a tip."|stage direction|||
80|JOHN|"A hundred pounds a year to their
mother while she lives. Would that

parting with the fifteen hundred all
at once."|speech|JOHN|F|True

nods."|stage direction|||
82|FANNY|"But if she should live longer than

Norland? They already have a house
in London."|speech|MARGARET|F|True

father had no idea of your giving
them money."|speech|FANNY|F|True

amongst them as it is--"|speech|JOHN|F|True

health, thank you. My brother Robert
is in town with her this season and
quite the most popular bachelor in
London! He has his own barouche."|speech|FANNY|F|True

checks the hallmark on her butterknife."|stage direction|||

for the silver cabinet is kept."|speech|MARIANNE|F|True

128|MARIANNE|"I can only presume she wants to count
it. What are you doing?"|speech|MARIANNE|F|True
129|ELINOR|"Presents for the servants. Have you
seen Margaret? I am worried about
her. She has taken to hiding in the
oddest places."|speech|ELINOR|F|True

escape Fanny, which is more than any
of us is able."|speech|MARIANNE|F|True

144|ELINOR|"Pray, when may we expect the pleasure
of your brother's company?"|speech|ELINOR|F|True
145|FANNY|"Edward is due tomorrow. And my dear
Mrs Dashwood, in view of the fact
that he will not be with us for long,
I wondered if Miss Margaret would
mind giving up her room to him the
view is quite incomparable from her
windows and I should so much like
Edward to see Norland at its best."|speech|FANNY|F|True

bands with ELINOR. He behaves with great respect to the
DASHWOODS and seems embarrassed by FANNY's pro prietorial
air."|stage direction|||

Mrs Dashwood, I am beginning to doubt
of her existence! She must run
positively wild!"|speech|FANNY|F|True
156|MRS DASHWOOD|"Forgive us, Mr Ferrars. My youngest
is not to be found this morning. She
is a little shy of strangers at
present."|speech|MRS DASHWOOD|F|True

174||"As they speak, EDWARD notices a large atlas retreating
apparently all by itself across the floor. Someone is
obviously under the table, pulling it out of sight. He
registers it and immediately moves in such a way as to shield
it from FANNY. He turns back, searching for something to
divert her."|stage direction|||
175|EDWARD|"I hear you have great plans for the
walnut grove."|speech|EDWARD|M|True

covers with a cough."|stage direction|||

relief."|stage direction|||

giving instructions. EDWARD pretends to examine the mouldings
and she passes on unsuspecting."|stage direction|||

haven't seen you all day. Mamma is
very concerned."|speech|ELINOR|F|True

realisation."|stage direction|||
202|ELINOR|"Oh! No, no indeed. She is quite wrong.
For I believe it is in--in Belgium."|speech|ELINOR|F|True

thinking of the Volga."|speech|EDWARD|M|True

from."|speech|EDWARD|M|True

FANNY, who thumbs through a fashion-plate magazine. ELINOR
is at a desk by the window writing a letter we see the words
'of course we should like to leave as soon as possible'.
Suddenly she hears a commotion outside. MARGARET runs past
the window brandishing a stick. EDWARD follows, and proceeds
to teach her the first principles of sword-fighting. They
feint and parry, EDWARD serious and without a hint of
condescension, MARGARET concentrating furiously. EDWARD
suddenly turns, as though feeling ELINOR's gaze. She smiles
but looks away quickly."|stage direction|||

218||"EDWARD comes into the doorway and sees ELINOR who is listening
to MARIANNE playing a concerto. ELINOR stands in a graceful,
rather sad attitude, her back to us. Suddenly she senses
EDWARD behind her and turns. He is about to turn away,
embarrassed to have been caught admiring her, when he sees
she has been weeping. Hastily she tries to dry her eyes. He
comes forward and offers her a handkerchief, which she takes
with a grateful smile. We notice his monogram in the corner:
ECF."|stage direction|||

entire village is present--CHILDREN, FARMERS, LABOURERS,
SHOPKEEPERS, and all our PRINCIPALS. We see MRS JENNINGS in
a gigantic mauve bonnet, CHARLOTTE and MR PALMER, SIR JOHN,
MRS DASHWOOD, MARGARET, THOMAS, JOHN and FANNY, who is dressed
in a fantastically inappropriate concoction, and some MEN in
regimental uniform.
The path to the church is strewn with wild flowers and
everyone holds a bunch of their own. The church bells start
to peal, and a great cheer goes up as the door opens and
BETSY comes out holding the bridal cake aloft.
The bride and groom appear: MARIANNE, in white lawn, and
COLONEL BRANDON in full uniform. Behind them come EDWARD in
his parson's garb and, on his arm, ELINOR as matron of honour.
CLOSE on them as they watch the party moving away. MARIANNE
and BRANDON make their way forwards, everyone throws their
flowers over them, whooping and singing. An open carriage
decked with bridal wreaths comes to meet them, and BRANDON
lifts MARIANNE in. His melancholy air is all but gone and he
radiates joyful life and vigour. MARIANNE also looks extremely
happy - but there is a gravity to her joy that makes her
seem much older.
According to the custom of the time, BRANDON throws a large
handful of six pences into the crowd, and the VILLAGE CHILDREN
jump and dive for them.
The coins spin and bounce, catching the sun like jewels. One
hits FANNY in the eye. She reels and falls over backwards
into a gorse bush. CAM pulls back as the wedding procession
makes its glorious way from the church. We draw away into
the surrounding countryside.
Then we see, on the far edge of frame, very small, a MAN
sitting on a white horse, watching. It is WILLOUGHBY. As we
draw back further still, he slowly pulls the horse around
and moves off in the opposite direction."|stage direction|||
