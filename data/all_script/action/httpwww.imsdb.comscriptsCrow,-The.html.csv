LOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT - FLOWERS ON GRAVES
As we MOVE alongside a pair of canvas-sided combat boots, as the
wearer collects the most lively flowers from each grave in
sequence.
TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW
Cemetery DEFOCUSED b.g.  Large, glossy-black, the bird follows
the arc of movement in the previous shot.  Ruffles its feathers
as it begins to sprinkle rain.
ANGLE - ELLY - RESUMING HER MOTION
A dirty-blondish tenement KID of eleven, clad in a blend of cast-
offs and hand-me-downs; her version of street punk chic.  She
totes a skateboard under one arm (itself a berserk Jackson
Pollock chaos of band stickers, silver marker and graffiti, with
day-glo wheels), and transfers her impromptu bouquet so she may
unzip a flap and hike up a ragged hood against the rain.  She
stops to watch the grave diggers pack up and EXIT b.g."|stage direction

TILT UP from rose to the name: ERIC DRAVEN. Rain spatters the
granite, darkening it.
EXTREME CLOSE-UP - CROW's EYE
It blinks in its alien way.
WITH THE CROW
as it takes wing from it's unseen perch.  Lands stop Eric's
headstone.  It pecks tentatively at the top of the monument.

CAMERA WITH ELLY -  BOOMING BACK HIGH
as she exits the iron gates of the cemetery without looking

alleyways, like hungry mouths, are gradually revealed as we
continue PULLING BACK to unveil that the cemetery is smack in
the middle of the city."|stage direction

and a chip of granite flies off, bang!
EXTREME CLOSE - THE HEADSTONE
as the crow pecks again and draws blood from the rock.
CLOSE-UP - THE CROW
A dot of blood on its ebony beak.
LOW ANGLE - HEADSTONE
A thin, watery trickle of blood wanders from the top of the
stone towards the earth.  Rain does not interfere.  Lightning
plays in the rolling cloud cover, b.g.
RESUME THE CROW
as it takes off from the gravestone, into the rain.
CLOSE-UP - THE BLOOD
It slowly fills the name Eric Draven into the rock.
CLOSE-UP - FOOT TAPPER
A LOW ANGLE like the SHOT introducing Elly's boot.  This time
we see cowboy boots, leather chaps.  The foot taps.  Waiting.
MEDIUM ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER
as lightning strikes.  Just enough for us to see a figure in a
long duster and a cowboy hat.
RESUME ERIC'S HEADSTONE
DRAVEN fills with blood.  Blood continues groundward.
NEW ANGLE - THE FOOT TAPPER
Turning to meet FRAME as the crow alights on his outstretched
arm.  This is the SKULL COWBOY.  We glimpse the deathshead,
beneath the brim of the cowboy hat.
RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE
as blood trickles into the turf at the base of the grave.
TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW
shaking off rain.  Watching intently.
CLOSE-UP - THE SKULL COWBOY'S FREE HAND
Black gloved.  It walks a flat silver throwing knife across it's
knuckles, like a quarter somersaulting.
RESUME ERIC'S GRAVE
The turf stirs beneath the white rose.  Magically, a slim white
parts the earth to grasp the rose.
SKULL COWBOY POV - ERIC's GRAVE
as the figure of Eric Draven stands up from behind his own
headstone.
LOW ANGLE (FROM GRAVE) - ERIC
Pale.  Clad in cerements: cheap black burial suit, slit open in
back.  WHite shirt.  A nothing tie.  No shoes.  Rain sluices mud
from his upturned face.  He looks to the sky.  Lightning.
ANOTHER ANGLE - FOLLOW ERIC
as he weaves to lean against a nearby tree.  Looks o.s.
ERIC's POV - THE SKULL COWBOY
water-blurred, through the rain, standing with the crow perched
on his arm like a hunting falcon.  He releases it and it flies
to the tree.
ANGLE -  ERIC
Watching this.  Wipes mud from his eyes, tries to clear vision.
The crow lights in the tree and they meet eye-to-eye.  Eric
looks back o.s. and we RACK to include the Skull Cowboy."|stage direction
46|ERIC|What the hell are you?|speech
47|SKULL COWBOY|Interested?  Follow the crow.|speech
48||"NB.  The Skull Cowboy speaks in nicely distorted, buzzlike
charnal house whisper.  Unsettling and hackle-raising.
Eric turns back to the bird, which takes wing in the rain, His
eyes follow it.  He looks back, disoriented, doubtful, but the
Skull Cowboy is gone.
LOW DEEP ANGLE - THE CROW
Taking wing in the rain, showing the way.
ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC
alone in the cemetery.  After a moments hesitation, he lurches
off, following the crow."|stage direction

darting eyes.
COMPLETE CAMERA MOVE to include SKANK, a blade-thin speed freak

Gun out, hauling ass on wet pavement.  Aims at the departing

ANGLE - THE WOMAN
hurting, cut, bleeding, tottering toward the dumpster.  Duct tape
stuck to her face but cut away around her mouth.  With her as
she falls into the alley darkness... straight into the arms of
CLOSE TWO-SHOT - ERIC AND THE WOMAN
Their eyes lock.  Eric stiffens with his first FLASH.
NB:  Eric's flashes of past memory are conditioned by the nature
of things with which he makes physical contact.  Hints and
fragments in fierce, super-saturated COLOR.  Puzzle pieces he
must assemble.  Each flash keynoted by a BLOWBACK NOISE and
accompanied by a degree of pain.  It hurts to remember.
FLASH:  INT. T-BIRD - WOMAN'S STRUGGLE
The faces of Skank and T-Bird are murky, ephemeral, their voices
hideous, distorted echoes.  A knife snaps open.  We see the

the wall across from the backside of Arcade Games.
ANGLE - THE CROW (FLYING)
Circling, then lighting on the fire escape above Eric.
BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES - (""CROWVISION"")
""CROWVISION"" is what the crow ""gives"" Eric to see.  Visually
distinct and immediately identifiable.
ERIC'S POV - BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES
Which he's already seen through the crow's eyes.
ANGLE - ERIC
looking up at the crow.  Disoriented.  Doesn't understand.
Suddenly he cottons, and covers his eyes just in time to shield
from:
ANGLE - BACK OF ARCADE GAMES
The rear windows EXPLODING outward in a spray of fire and
debris.
ANGLE - WITH ERIC
he reels back, crashes into a dumpster.  Falls.
ANGLE - THE CROW
landing on the dumpsters edge near a pair of discarded combat
boots in the trash.  Flames.
LOW ANGLE - ERIC
The blood from his hands mars his burial shirt.  He tears the
shirt away, leaving his tie absurdly intact.  Wipes his face
with his shirt.  Discards it.  Stops, held by his discovery --
PUSH IN ON ERIC
as his fingers explore the five puckered bullet punctures in his
chest.  Almost a circle.  Comically, he feels his back foe exit
wounds.  Then hauls himself upright, coming level with the crow.
His glance at the bird is almost accusatory.
ANGLE - THe CROW
Inscrutable.  We should get the idea that some silent
communication is taking place.
ANGLE - ERIC'S FEET
bare, muddied, frozen.  TILT to Eric.  His gaze moves from the
crow to the boots in the trash.  He grabs them, pushes them onto
his bare feet.  His eyes catch the firelight.  Distant o.s.

music is hard, savage, primal:  a doom-laden Radio Werewolf band

trendazoids.  We'll see more of this circus later.  Right now
the BG SOUND is our biggest clue to the flavor of this
establishment since we are --
TIGHT CLOSE-UP A FRAMED 8X10
Thinly filmed in dust, mounted among dozens of other band shots.
Visible among the posed members of a group called Diabolique is
Eric, wielding guitar on the club stage.  ND BLUR as people
CROSS FRAME.
GRANGE, 45-50, powerful, a seasoned assassin, cruel but loyal.
His facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly
down the corridor.:  NGO NWA, 50ish, clad Chinese gangster style
- white topcoat, white scarf, tinted shades - and two body guards
supplying a power perimeter around him,lean, dark-haired Asian
killers who would gladly die for Ngo Nwa, which they will in
just a minute.
They have just passed the Diabolique 8X10.  Ngo Nwa's gloved
fingers, in passing, leave little skid tracks in the dust that
clear the eyes of Eric in the photo.
As the foursome reaches the DOOR, Grange turns doubtfully --
suspiciously -- to Nwa."|stage direction
108|NGO NWA|He will see me... unannounced.|speech
109||"ANOTHER ANGLE - THE DOOR

Grange's face by the Bodyguards, who post themselves to either
side."|stage direction

(mirrored on the club side) all sorts of activity is visible
through automatic mini-blinds.  A fly-vision bank of 12 TV
monitors is hot with surveillance.
LAO, a painfully clean-cut, Armani-clad Asian, impeccable,
almost dashing, but the dynamic here is crystal clear: Nwa is
the King: Lao, the dark prince in this hierarchy.
At the desk, Lao is startled from his contemplation of a tiny,
perfect rat skeleton by Ngo Nwa's unheralded entry.  The desktop
is bare except for and Arcane Vietnamese fighting knife, half a
meter long with an ideogrammed blade, dramatically positioned
beneath an Artemide lamp.  Lao rises and feigns servility.

VIETNAMESE."|stage direction

is somehow errant"|stage direction

119|LAO|(begrudging agreement)|speech

the Nwa hilt-first in both hands, as if bestowing a thing of
immeasurable worth."|stage direction
121|NGO NWA|(why give me this?)|speech
122||"Nonetheless, Nwa accepts the blade.  It gleams.  Hypnotic. Even
Nwa has to admire it.  Turns it so the blade is pointed at his
sternum.  His attitude indicates Lao is too far away to do
anything untoward."|stage direction
123|LAO|(sinister punchline)|speech
124||"Lao spins through the air and HEEL-KICKS the blade THROUGH Nwa's
chest, pinning him to the door.  It's over so fast the gasp of
astonishment never escapes Nwa.  Lao is much more than merely
treacherous, he is extremely capable."|stage direction

Lao exchanges a look with his right arm; Grange nods
affirmatively."|stage direction
129|GRANGE|"You gonna smoke his bones now, or
however it is you do it?"|speech

falls turns into a TUMBLING ROLL that lands Eric back on his feet

runs out of the frame.
ANOTHER ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON THE RUN.
as he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up.
TRACK WITH HIM to the edge of the roof, heavily misted in rain.
He jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof.  The next
roof-top is a one-story jump down.  Eric clears the jump with a
WOOF of air.  Keeping his eyes on the flying crow; gaining
strength.  His next leap is more like a broad-jump.  Athletic.
FAST MOVING ANGLE - THE CROW
keeping airborne, keeping ahead.
MOVING ANGLE - ERIC
Eyes confidently on the sky as he arches out into space...
UP ANGLE FROM STREET - BUILDINGS
As Eric is seen to jump across the gap at least three stories up

CLOSE ANGLE - TARGET BUILDING LEDGE
as Eric smashes into it, just missing, hinging at the waist,
grabbing for purchase, suddenly panicked, gravity pulling him
downward.
ANGLE - AT ERIC FROM PHONE CABLE BRACKET

executes a one-handed pull-up that will save his ass."|stage direction

rips from the wall and Eric plummets, with a howl of defeat.
UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S DOWNFALL
It's a looooooong way down.
ANGLE - ALLEYWAY
as Eric lands and splits a trash can in two.  A beat as we wonder
if any bones are left unpulped.  PUSH IN as Eric rolls from
facedown to his back.
TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE
as he completes the roll, gasping, amazed he's still in one
piece.

on a scarred banister knob.  Eric's footsteps come down into frame.
ANGLE ON LOFT DOOR - INCLUDE ERIC
A year ago this door was sealed with police barricade tape...
