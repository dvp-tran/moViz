signature.  No cavitation, no reactor noise...
doesn't even sound like screws."|speech
9||"He puts the signal onto a speaker and everyone in the attack room listens to
the intruder's acoustic signature, a strange THRUMMING.  The captain studies
the electronic position board, a graphic representation of the contours of
the steep-walled canyon, a symbol for the Montana, and converging with it, an
amorphous trace, representing the bogey."|stage direction

at us, FILLING FRAME.
REVERSE, as they barrel OVER CAMERA toward a lone civilian ship... an ugly
but very sophisticated deep-sea drilling support ship, the BENTHIC EXPLORER.
It is a twin-hulled monstrosity with a central opening in its deck, around
which crouch enormous cranes, winches and other arcane equipment.
The first Sea King settles onto the helipad, disgorging a contingent of Naval
officers, technicians, and a squad of armed seamen.  A pantomime in the
rotorwash, we see the Benthic Petroleum ""company man"" KIRKHILL greeting
COMMODORE DEMARCO, the on-scene commander."|stage direction

78||"WIDER, showing the Navy contingent crowding the control room.  DeMarco is
hardcore military, brusque and efficient.  Kirkhill is a small man with
pinched features, wearing a shirt and tie, which on a drill ship means
company man and/or dickhead."|stage direction

of light in the vast blackness.  Its main framework connects two ""tri-
modules"" consisting of three cylinders each.  These contain living and work
areas in a pressurized environment.  An umbilical cable, thick as a man's
thigh, runs up from the oil rig into the darkness, to the Benthic Explorer
at the surface.  In a bubble-like dome port window we see the rig foreman, or
""toolpusher,"" BUD BRIGMAN.  He's talking (via headset) with two divers
working outside... 'CATFISH' DE VRIES, AND LEW 'BIRD-DOG' FINLER."|stage direction

plastered overalls, tend the massive spinning turn-table in the center of the
chamber.  The semi-automated system requires only five men to operate.  The
others are LUPTON MCWHIRTER, DWIGHT PERRY, JAMMER WILLIS, and TOMMY RAY

packed with instrumentation.  At the end is a small bay with multiple
viewports.  Outside, at a 'Christmas tree' pipe installation, a lone diver
can be seen welding.  He is accompanied by a large submersible, FLATBED, and
by a Remotely Operated Vehicle, or ROV, call LITTLE GEEK.  Little Geek is an
underwater robot which operated on the end of a cable-like control TETHER.
It has a single video 'eye' in front, by which the operator pilots the little
machine.  The rig's ROV pilots is ALLEN 'HIPPY' CARNES, who stands by the
window twiddling his joysticks and drinking coffee.  His pet white rat,
BEANY, crawls contentedly around his shoulders.  The door BANGS OPEN.
Hippy jumps, slops his coffee.  Bud strides in.  Not calm."|stage direction

bubble canopy.  She is a no-nonsense lady who holds her own in the mostly
male environment by being one of the best submersible drivers in the
business.  She controls a hydraulic manipulator arm, assisting the diver,
ARLISS 'SONNY' DAWSON, in his work.  Little Geek hovers around them like a
tiny helicopter.  One Night moves the Flatbed arm to Sonny and hands him the

through it.  From inside the sub-bay it looks just like a swimming pool.
Flatbed surfaces, nearly filling it.  The chamber also contains CAB ONE, a
similar submersible.  Jammer, Perry, and some of the other drill-room boys
are helping the divers out of the water.  The water at this depth is only
about six degrees above freezing, and these folks are cold and prune-

conservatively in a skirt and jacket.  Meet LINDSEY.  Project Engineer for
Deepcore.  She's a pain in the ass, but you'll like her.  Eventually.
She's holding on grimly, sitting crammed in with the SEALs and a bunch of
gear, getting tossed around by the storm.  The SEALs are dressed alike in
black fatigues.  They are muscular, finely-tuned and extremely dangerous
special-forces types.  The leader of the SEAL team, LIEUTENANT COFFEY, makes

transparent outer hull housing interior structures of great delicacy and
complexity, pulsing with a blue-violet glow.
Lindsey stand before it, unable to move.  Absolutely rapt.
Captivated by its ethereal beauty.  It begins to turn, majestically, one
rounded wing passing only a few feet above her.  She reaches up.  Touches it
as it passes over her.
Lindsey is without fear, completely mesmerized.

is gently lifted by a backwash of turbulent water.

machine glides into the depths.  Gets all set for a shot and...
WOOSH!  The little 'scoutschip' whizzes past her from behind, startling her.

python, it elongates and weaves across the room.  It extends and extends,

pseudopod, taking its time, checks them out and then moves on.
IN THE MESS HALL, it's dark and quiet.  Lindsey has even fallen asleep in her
chair, her head buried in her arms on the table.  The shimmering tentacle

turning... sees the apparition next to her.

open like a total goon.
Bud chucks his pillow are Catfish, on the next table.
Catfish cracks one eye open.  Turns away.  Turns right back... both eyes open
now.  Sensing movement, the thing turn back toward them.  It seems to
recognize Lindsey.  It doubles back on itself in a loop and comes right up to
her.  She holds her ground, fascinated.
The bulbous tip forms suddenly into a human face... her face.  It is water,
still clear and undulating... but definitely Lindsey.  She gasps in surprise.
The liquid-Lindsey gasps soundlessly... a perfect mimic of her expression.
Lindsey laughs involuntarily.  It laughs... without sound.  Lindsey makes a

modules at full throttle, slamming into each other and the steel pressure
hulls.
Coffey sideswipes the smaller sub, jamming it sideways.  It screeches along
the flank of one of the trimodules.
They head out over empty terrain in a flat-out speed run.
Lindsey is jinking and dodging as Flatbed, roars along behind her, tearing
up the bottom with its powerful backwash.  Lindsey carves hard around a rock
pinnacle, finding herself running parallel to the edge of the abyssal canyon.
Coffey is ramming, hammering from behind, then from side to side.
Lindsey snarls.  He's pissing her off.  He shouldn't do that.
Ahead, out of the blackness, another outcropping.
Lindsey rises, cuts right.
Smashes down into Coffey's craft.  Timing it just right.  He skids catch in
the rocks.
Flatbed slews violently, nosing down.  Crushing into the rocky bottom.
Pressing the advantage, Lindsey hammers into Flatbed from behind.
It smashes full force into a second spire, spinning out of control.
Tangles together, the subs slide down an embankment toward the edge of the
wall.  With her one remaining thruster she jerks clear of Flatbed and grounds
her crippled sub.  Flatbed tumbles over the edge.

He has no buoyancy or motors and the craft continues its mad plunge.  As the

A tiny silver fracture shoots partway across the front bubble.  Grows.
Coffey gives up fighting.  Just stares, wide eyed, at his death.  A damned
soul dropping into the bottomless pit.

BUD'S POV... A glowing figure hovers before him, like a vision.  It seems to
be an angel.  Seen closer, as it drifts toward him, we see that it is an
extraterrestrial being, bioluminescent like some deep-sea fish.  Its body
and limbs are transparent, and it resembles a figure made of blown glass.  A
delicate mantle or veil billows out around its like a corona, which pulsates
gently, propelling the being with the hypnotic grace of a Spanish dancer.  The
head is refined and strangely anthropomorphic, with large eyes that convey a
cold, dispassionate wisdom.

nearly collided with at the Montana wreck.  The larger manta-ships.  And
others, strangely configured, moving in the darkness below like luminous fish.
Suddenly the darkness explodes with light.  A vast, reticulated pattern of
brightly glowing lines, like some enormous circuit diagram, appears below
them, covering the floor of the abyssal trench.  It sweeps outward from the

swirling down like a whirlpool, just dimpling down.
It gets wider.  Deeper.  Rapidly becomes a yawning pit.
The ocean is OPENING.
Now the surface is churned by turbulence.  Slow massive roils of tremendous
power boil up from the depths.
McBride leads a mass exodus onto the deck to see better.
The open becomes a roaring maw a hundred yards across.
The ships are like toys on the shimmering rim of the maelstrom.
SOMETHING RISES IN THE CENTER OF THE OPENING.  A massive spire.  Smoothly
curving and iridescent.  Off the starboard beam, a quarter mile away, another
spire rises.  Tons of seawater fall from its sides with a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the
energy of Niagara.
Off the port bow... another spire.
And another, beyond the destroyer Albany, dwarfing it.
Six towers... plus one larger, in the center.  Rising.
One the Explorer's deck, a shadow engulfs them as the nearest spire blocks out
the sun.  The air, the sea, the deck... all vibrate with the THUNDER OF
CREATION.
And now for the payoff shot:  WE'RE HIGH, LOOKING DOWN.  THE SPIRES FORM A
PERFECT RING A MILE ACROSS.  A VAST DARK FORM, LIKE A GREAT SHADOW, RISES FROM
THE DEPTHS BENEATH THE SHIPS.  THE SPIRES ARE CONNECTED.  IT IS ALL ONE.
THE NTI ARK.
It surfaces with slow majesty, gently beaching all the ships on its broad
back.  We recognize it as the structure into which Bud was led by the angelic
being, which we assumed was a city.  The Explorer rocks gently on its flat
hull, clunking massively to one side as it settles.
The bridge crew watch millions of tons of seawater streaming off the back of
the vast, slightly curved hull.  The missile cruiser rocks back and forth
nearby, high and dry... its prop whining futility.
ON EXPLORER'S DECK, McBride, Bendix, DeMarco, the rest of the Navy
contingent... they're all standing there open-mouthed, in a dream-like daze.
Touched by the hand of God."|stage direction

Two.  It looks like a particularly ugly and unwanted toy, sitting on the

CLOSER, ON TRIMODULE C, as the hatch at the bottom opens.
Catfish's feet appear, bicycling.  He swings down to the pearlescent 'deck'.
Stands there blinking in the sunlight, mole-like.  Jammer plonks down behind
him.  He turns, lifts Lindsey down.  Hippy, Sonny, and the rest, emerge into

REVERSE, as Bud walks up the curving incline of one of the mouth-like
enterances to the NTI structure.  His suit is casually unzipped and the FBS
helmet dangles from one hand jauntily.
She starts toward him.  Breaks into a run.  Then stops a few feet from him.
Watching him come to her.
His smile, his eyes illuminating her.
He stops and she touches him, lightly.  Is this real?
The look at each other, wonderingly a moment.
