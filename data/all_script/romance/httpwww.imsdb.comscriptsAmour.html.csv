The hallway is a mess. A window opening onto a light well is
open.
The door to the apartment is suddenly broken open. A plain-
clothes detective, two uniformed police officers and several
firemen - also in uniform - enter and look around. They all
wear gloves and masks that cover their mouths and noses.
Behind them, the superintendent and his wife also push their
way in. They're both holding their noses. In his free hand,
the superintendent holds a pile of mail and promotional
flyers. Behind him, comes a female neighbor."|stage direction

Can you try?"|speech
9||"While the firemen go to work on the door, the plain-clothes
detective goes into the adjoining dining room. He opens the
windows quickly and turns to go into the room to the left via
the double doors. They are locked and the gaps are also taped
up. He turns to the right and goes into the living room,
where he also opens up the windows..."|stage direction

The door is open."|speech

police officer and the janitor."|stage direction

whole time, they had a nurse, but

17||"The firemen shake their heads.
The PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE turns toward the big double bed
placed against the back wall of the bedroom. On the right-
hand bed, there's only the bare mattress. On the left-hand
bed lies the partly decomposed body of an old woman. Where
once there were eyes, now there are only gaping holes. The
corpse has been neatly dressed and is adorned with flowers
that have already dried out a little. On her chest is a
crucifix.
SCENE 2 - White letters on a black background: THE CREDITS
SCENE 3 - INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT
All we see is the audience pouring into the hall. GEORGES and
ANNE, both are around eighty, are part of this crowd. They go
to their seats in one of the rows near the front. Once
everybody is seated, we hear the usual ANNOUNCEMENT asking
people to turn off their mobile phones. Some people, caught
with their phones switched on, hasten to comply. Then the
lights go out. APPLAUSE.
Off-screen, we hear the soloist make his entrance. THROATS
ARE CLEARED here and there. Finally, the MUSIC begins.
SCENE 4 - INT. ARTISTS DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
The music from Scene 3 continues. The soloist is surrounded
by admirers who congratulate him.
Now Georges and Anne push their way into the room. (If the
soloist is female, they will be carrying flowers, like most
of the others)."|stage direction

19||"When the soloist notices their presence, he leaves his group
of fans, heads towards them and greets them very warmly,
visibly glad to see them.
SCENE 5 - INT. BUS - NIGHT
Continuation of the MUSIC from Scene 3.
Georges and Anne are seated side by side in the half empty
bus. Anne talks enthusiastically, Georges says something from
time to time, and smiles now and then. They are both relaxed
and happy.
SCENE 6 - INT. APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT
The door to the apartment is unlocked and opened from the
outside. THE MUSIC ENDS.
Georges comes in, turns on the light. He and Anne observe the
open door. Around the lock, one can see the traces of an
attempted forced entry.
Georges bends down and runs his fingers over the deep
grooves."|stage direction
20|GEORGES|"They used a screwdriver or
something like that...it doesn't
look very professional..."|speech
21|ANNE|"But who would do something like
that?"|speech
22|GEORGES|"No idea. Why do people break in?
Because they want to steal
something."|speech
23|ANNE|From us?|speech
24|GEORGES|"(laughs briefly out loud)
Hey, why not? If I thought about
it, I could come up with at least
three or four people we know who've
been burgled."|speech
25||"After having examined the outside of the second leaf of the
double door, he comes in, closing the door behind him."|stage direction
26|GEORGES|4.|speech
27|ANNE|"What time is it? Can't we call the
superintendent?"|speech
28|GEORGES|"I'll do that tomorrow morning.
Anyway, they didn't see anything."|speech
29||"He unbuttons his overcoat and heads toward the large closet
in the hallway."|stage direction
30|GEORGES (CONT'D)|"Don't let it spoil your good mood
now."|speech
31|ANNE|Or the police?|speech
32|GEORGES|Come on, give me your coat.|speech

his in the closet."|stage direction
34|ANNE|"Imagine if we were here, in our
beds, and someone broke in."|speech
35|GEORGES|Why should I imagine that?|speech

of fright."|speech

38||He undoes his shoes.|stage direction
39|GEORGES (CONT'D)|Shall we have a drink?|speech
40|ANNE|I'm tired.|speech
41|GEORGES|I still fancy a drink.|speech

slippers. Anne has gone into the bathroom."|stage direction
43|GEORGES|"5.
ANNE (O.S.)
Go ahead then. Mathilde told me
that in her building, the attic
apartment was burgled from the
loft. They just knocked a hole in
the wall, cut out all of the
valuable pictures from their frames
and disappeared without a trace."|speech
44||He goes toward the kitchen.|stage direction
45|GEORGES|They must have been professionals.|speech

to be looking at Anne."|stage direction

tonight?"|speech

You're proud of him, huh?"|speech

Georges wakes up. He looks with amazement beside him, then
raises his eyes. Anne is sitting upright, her back against
the headboard."|stage direction
57|GEORGES (CONT'D)|Something wrong?|speech
58|ANNE|"No.
6."|speech
59||"After a while, the RINGING of a kitchen egg-timer leads us to
the next scene.
SCENE 8 - INT. KITCHEN - DAY
The egg timer in the kitchen RINGS.
Georges is seated in front of the window, at a table which is
half set for breakfast. He has mobile phone raised to his ear
and a phone book opened in front of him. Anne is getting up
from the table. She goes toward the stove, turns off the gas,
takes the egg out of the pan with a spoon and runs it under
cold water. Like Georges, she is still in her robe."|stage direction
60|GEORGES|"(on the phone)
What about next week? No but still,
it would make sense to get it done
soon. It might give people silly
ideas. And anyway, it's too ugly to
look at... Wednesday? What time?
OK... Will you bring the paint with
you too, to paint over it? But at
least some primer...Yes, OK. Thank
you."|speech
61||He hangs up.|stage direction
62|"GEORGES (CONT'D)
(TO ANNE)"|You can depend on that guy.|speech
63|ANNE|"(who comes back to the table with
the egg) I hope so. The last time,
he kept us waiting for ages, if you
remember."|speech
64|GEORGES|"(laughs while acquiescing)
Yes, that's true. (Reacting when
she places the egg in his egg cup)
Thanks. If I call a regular
professional, we'll still be
waiting two months time."|speech
65|ANNE|"(more to herself)
Really?"|speech
66||"She has sat down. Looks straight ahead. He cracks open his
egg, puts salt on it, eats."|stage direction
67|ANNE|7.|speech
68|GEORGES|"The Frodons waited three days when
their toilet was blocked. Not
exactly pleasant."|speech
69||"He eats. Wants to put on more salt, but the saltcellar is
empty."|stage direction
70|GEORGES (CONT'D)|The saltcellar is empty.|speech
71||"He looks up for an instant, as if he expected her to deal
with it. As she doesn't react, he realizes the
inappropriateness of such an expectation, gets up himself,
heads for the kitchen cupboards and fills the salt cellar."|stage direction
72|GEORGES (CONT'D)|"I don't know if he's going to bring
us the CD. Maybe he won't come at
all. In any case, he didn't mention
it. I'd like to buy it. It was
really good and I don't want to
wait long for it. We could go to
Virgin this afternoon and buy it.
What do you say?"|speech
73||He comes back to the table and sits down again.|stage direction
74|GEORGES (CONT'D)|Hmmm? Anne? What's the matter?|speech
75||She looks at him and doesn't answer.|stage direction
76|GEORGES (CONT'D)|What's going on? What's the matter?|speech
77||He waves his hand in front of her eyes and laughs nervously.|stage direction
78|GEORGES (CONT'D)|Helllloooo!!! Cuckoo!!! I'm here!|speech
79||She continues to look at him without reacting.|stage direction
80|GEORGES (CONT'D)|"(serious now) Anne! What's going
on?"|speech
81||"He waits, looks at her. No reaction. He stands up slightly,
leans over the table to sit beside her. Tries to make her
turn toward him."|stage direction
82|GEORGES (CONT'D)|"Anne, what's the matter?
8."|speech
83||"He manages to get her torso to turn halfway toward him, but
her eyes look through him."|stage direction
84|GEORGES (CONT'D)|Anne...what's...|speech
85||He takes her face in both hands and turns toward him.|stage direction
86|GEORGES (CONT'D)|Anne...|speech
87||"She stares into the void. He drops his hands. Then sits
beside her, for quite awhile."|stage direction
88||SILENCE|location
89||"Finally he gets up, heads for the sink, turns on the tap,
wets a tea towel, wrings it out a little, comes back and
places it on Anne's face. Waits for a reaction that doesn't
come. Then he pulls up her hair in the nape of her neck and
applies the cloth there. Then sits down and looks at her
imploringly."|stage direction
90|GEORGES (CONT'D)|"(close to tears)
Anne...Darling...please!"|speech
91||"Once again they both remain seated. In the background, we
hear the GUSHING of the tap that in his panic he has
forgotten to turn it off.
Making a sudden decision, he gets up, rapidly crossing the
hallway, he goes into the bedroom where he starts to dress
agitatedly, which takes him quite a lot of time. Suddenly,
the GUSHING of the tap stops, which had accompanied us as far
as the bedroom.
George doesn't notice it immediately, then he stops short."|stage direction
92|GEORGES (CONT'D)|Anne?|speech
93||"Finally he returns, half dressed, into the kitchen.
Anne is seated in the same place and looks at him."|stage direction
94|ANNE|What are you doing?|speech
95||She turns toward the breakfast.|stage direction
96|ANNE (CONT'D)|"You left the water running.
9."|speech
97||Georges stares at her.|stage direction
98|GEORGES|"(both aghast and furious)
Hey, what's going on? Are you
completely crazy? Is this supposed
to be a joke, or what's going on?"|speech
99||She looks at him with amazement.|stage direction
100|ANNE|What did you say?|speech
101|"GEORGES
(SERIOUSLY)"|"Is this a joke? Is this meant to be
a joke?"|speech
102|ANNE|"What joke? I don't get it! Why are
you talking to me like that? What's
got into you?"|speech
103||Georges comes from the door to the table.|stage direction
104|GEORGES|"Anne! Please! Stop this game. It's
not funny."|speech
105|"ANNE
(GETTING IRRITATED)"|"What game, for Christ's sake? What
on earth's the matter?!!"|speech
106||"Georges is about to answer in a similarly irritated tone,
but gradually begins to suspect that he could be mistaken. He
tries to calm down, takes his chair that has remained beside
Anne, sits down and looks at his wife. She doesn't know how
to react."|stage direction
107|GEORGES|"What's the matter? Why didn't you
react?"|speech
108|ANNE|To what?|speech
109|GEORGES|To what? To me, to everything.|speech
110|ANNE|"When?
10."|speech
111|GEORGES|Just now. A moment ago.|speech
112|ANNE|"Please tell me what's wrong. What
am I supposed to have done?"|speech
113||"Georges first looks away reluctantly, then looks at Anne. He
doesn't want to believe that its serious."|stage direction
114|GEORGES|"I don't know what to say. Do you
really not know what just happened?"|speech
115|ANNE|But what DID happen?|speech
116|GEORGES|"(almost reluctantly bowing his head
as he speaks) You were sitting
there, staring at me. You didn't
answer me when I asked you what the
matter was."|speech
117||He picks up the wet tea towel from the table.|stage direction
118|GEORGES (CONT'D)|"I put this tea towel on your face,
and you didn't react."|speech
119||"Anne looks at the towel, then at Georges, and shakes her
head, perturbed that she can't understand. Georges looks at
her. He sees the damp marks on the collar of her robe."|stage direction
120|GEORGES (CONT'D)|"Look... There's still dampness on
your collar."|speech
121||"Anne follows his gesture, tugs on her collar and sees the
damp marks. She slowly grasps that something is awry."|stage direction
122|ANNE|When... When was it?|speech
123|GEORGES|Just now, a few minutes ago.|speech
124|ANNE|So...??|speech
125|GEORGES|"There's no ""So"". I went into the
bedroom to get dressed. I wanted to
get help.
11."|speech
126|ANNE|Help?|speech
127|GEORGES|"Yes, and then you turned off the
tap."|speech
128|ANNE|Yes. Because you left it on.|speech

Dr. Bertier?"|speech
134|ANNE|Why? What can he do?|speech
135|GEORGES|I don't know. Examine you.|speech
136|ANNE|"I'm fine. There's nothing wrong
with me."|speech
137|GEORGES|"Anne, please!! That's absurd. We
can't pretend that nothing
happened."|speech

139||PAUSE.|stage direction
140|ANNE (CONT'D)|"I'm here. I'm having my breakfast,
and you're telling me things
happened that I don't understand."|speech
141|GEORGES|"Can you explain how the tea towel
got there?
12."|speech
142|"ANNE
(IRRITATED)"|No, I can't!|speech
143|GEORGES|Who turned on the tap?|speech
144|ANNE|You did!|speech
145|GEORGES|Can you remember that?|speech

tears) No I can't! Do you want to
torture me? Leave me in peace!"|speech

to fetch Dr. Bertier?"|speech
149|ANNE|No!|speech

we go to Stockholm for four days,

We're playing the ""Dowland

Very industrious."|speech
162|GEORGES|That sounds rather derogatory.|speech
163|EVA|"No!! He's not like Geoff. Quiet,
but stubborn. I think he'll do all
right. At the last Conservatory

the Haydn Concerto. It was very
good. Geoff was there and

My God, you know him, don't you?
Over the winter, he suddenly
discovered his passion for a viola
player who'd been in our ensemble
for years. What can I tell you? It
was a huge drama, and the poor
little darling wound up trying to
commit suicide. That scared him and
he came back to me in full remorse.
I've got used to it now. What's a
bit embarrassing is that the
ensemble, you can't keep any
secrets from anyone."|speech

been afraid of doctors. They said
the risk was very low and that if
they didn't operate, she'd be
certain to have a serious stroke."|speech

First come sit with me."|speech

the footrest with her left hand and then extends her left arm
to Georges."|stage direction

your neck and your right arm around
me, that way it'll be easy."|speech

the short distance to the second arm chair. Cautiously, he
lowers her down and helps her sit herself straight. Because
they are not used to it, the whole process appears awkward
and clumsy."|stage direction

mention it"". Then he sits down opposite her.

afterwards I was thoroughly
distraught, and it took me a bit of
time to calm down. In the courtyard
of the house where grandma lived,
there was a young guy at the window
who asked me where I'd been. He was
a couple of years older than me, a

Eva, trying to compose herself, goes toward the window and
looks outside. Suddenly she starts sobbing.
After a while, Georges gets up and goes out of the room. Eva,
vexed, blows her nose.

I'm here... everything's fine...
we'll... Hold on, I'll tell you a
story... but you must be quiet, I
can't talk too loud, it wears me
out... Here we go: when I was
little... well, I wasn't as little
as all that... it was toward the
end of primary school, so I was
about ten, Dad and Mom sent me to a
holiday camp. They thought it would
do me good to spend the summer with
kids my own age... We were lodged
in an old castle in the midst of a
magnificent wooded landscape... I
think it was in the Auvergne... I
don't know... in any case it was
the opposite of what I'd
expected... We had to get up at 6
and go for a morning swim. Not far
from the castle, there was a pond
fed by an icy mountain stream. We
entered it running, in a double
file. You know, I was never very
sporty. They had a program to keep
us on the go all day, probably to
nip any potential pubescent
impulses in the bud ... But the
worst thing was the food. The third
day after our arrival, there was
rice pudding for lunch. I hate rice
pudding. We sat at long tables in a
huge hall. I didn't want to eat the
stuff and the housemaster said to
me: You won't get up until you've
cleared your plate. So after the
meal everybody left the room, and I
remained seated, in tears. I had
made a secret pact with Mom. I was
to send her a postcard every week."|speech
782|(MORE)|64.|speech
783|GEORGES (CONT'D)|"If I was pleased with the place I
was to draw some flowers on it, or
if not, some stars. She kept the
card; it was covered all over in
stars. After three hours, I was
allowed to leave the table. I went
up to my room, got into bed and had
a fever of 42 degrees. It was
diphtheria. They took me to the
nearest hospital where I was put in
an isolation ward, which meant that
Mom, when she came to visit me,
could only wave at me through a
window. At some point I lost that
postcard. It's a pity."|speech
784||"Anne has become ever calmer during Georges' story. He still
holds her hand.
LONG SILENCE.
Then Georges reaches across Anne's body to get hold of his
pillow and presses it over her face. STIFLED SOUNDS from
Anne. Everything that can still move in her body starts to
move. Georges presses down heavily on the pillow, lies on it
with his whole weight, for a long time, until all Anne's
movements stop. Then he sits up, exhausted, and without
removing the pillow from her face, remains seated beside her.
SILENCE.
SCENE 55 - INT. HALLWAY - KITCHEN - DAY
Hallway.
The front door of the apartment is unlocked. Georges, in city
clothes, enters with two big shopping bags full of cut
flowers. He puts down the bags, takes off his coat, hangs it
in the closet.
The TELEPHONE RINGS. Georges takes the bags and carries them
in the kitchen, puts them in the sink, fills it with water.
He starts to cut the stems and put the flowers in the water.
We watch him doing so for a while. Meanwhile, the TELEPHONE
HAS STOPPED RINGING.
SCENE 56 - INT. HALLWAY - DAY
Georges has opened one of the sections of the large wall
closet. He is looking for a specific dress. He takes some
out, puts them back inside. One of the dresses slips off its
hanger and falls to the floor. He picks it up, hangs it up
again. He ends up finding the one he was looking for. He
takes it out on its hanger. Closes the closet again."|stage direction

about to leave the bedroom. He catches his feet in the dress.
He just saves himself from tripping up by grabbing on to the
wheelchair that is parked there. Exhausted, he flops down
into it.
SCENE 57 - INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
With wide adhesive tape, Georges seals up the door frame of
the bedroom.
SCENE 58 - INT. KITCHEN - ADJOINING BEDROOM - HALLWAY - DAY
Georges is seated at the kitchen table where he had breakfast
with Anne in Scene 8, and writes a letter. PAUSES for
reflection. GENTLE COOING OF PIGEONS, scarcely audible.
Suddenly, Georges starts.
At the far end of the long kitchen, beside the door between
the kitchen units, a pigeon is walking. Georges stares at it.
For a long time.
Then he gets up slowly and, via the door located beside the
kitchen table, he goes into the adjoining room.
On the sofa there, he has set up his new bed. He takes the
wool blanket from the bed and comes back into the kitchen,
carefully approaches the pigeon that then runs off in alarm.
Georges carefully opens up the blanket and finally throws it
over the pigeon. But it manages to escape into the hallway.
Georges follows it. This action is repeated several times.
The pigeon is more and more panicky, starts to fly up,
flutters about in all directions. Georges closes the light-
well window to cut off its escape route. This lasts an
exhausting amount of time, but he ends up capturing it. He
cuddles it against him, rolled up in the blanket, leans
against a wall, then holds it as if it were a baby.
SCENE 59 - INT. ADJOINING ROOM - KITCHEN - NIGHT
From the adjoining room, we see Georges seated at the kitchen
table, writing. Finally we see what he is writing:
... you won't believe it. A pigeon came in, for the second
time already, through the light well. This time I caught it.
In fact it wasn't difficult at all. But I set it free again.
I'm going to ...

for a few moments into the bathroom. Meanwhile, Georges has
got up, and looks in the bathroom where, clearly, Anne is
