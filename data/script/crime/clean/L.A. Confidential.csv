RETURN FIRE.

They spot Exley lying there.  Hushed whispers as they
approach:  ""Dead meat.""  ""Be careful.""  Kicks in the
side.  The men look at each other, sneer.
Exley jerks a foot.  The foot man stumbles as Exley spins
around SHOOTING.  FIRING the .45 and his own .38.  All
four men go down.  Exley stands, digs into his pocket to
reload.
Bud scrambles back through the window.  Exley looks over

He's got Exley dead to rights.  As he squeezes the
trigger, Bud leaps forward, pushes Exley hard to the
ground.
The SHOT passes through Bud's back by his left shoulder
blade.  It spins him around.  A SECOND SHOT to the
stomach slows him to a walk as he charges Dudley.  A
THIRD ROUND SHATTERS Bud's jaw, but still he comes.
Driven by rage, his hands reaching for Dudley's throat.
He even gets hold before a FOURTH SLUG tears his chest.
Bud falls hard.
Dudley swings his aim to Exley who's just managed to
