1||"A WINDOWPANE
Assaulted from without by SNOWFLAKES. Wind tossed.
INSIDE, a bed, dappled with moon shadow. A LITTLE GIRL, fast
asleep. The wind whistles and sighs outside. She DREAMS...
Eyelids closed, eyes roving beneath... then suddenly they
SNAP open. A stifled cry. She thrashes for her STUFFED BEAR,
as a soft voice says:"|stage direction
2|VOICE|Shhhhh.|speech

12|MOM|Close your eyes now. I love you.|speech
13||"The child subsides, breathing steady. Eyes closed. The mother
rises. Regards her through the dimness. Slowly turns, heads
for the door. Flicks on a Winnie the Pooh NIGHTLIGHT --
Her entire right forearm is slicked with blood. More blood
on her Czech-made MP-5 machine gun.
She staggers just a little... barely noticeable. Passes out
on the light. Into darkness. Sits beside her daughter's bed.
The child sleeps peacefully. Outside snow slithers at the
glass.
FADE OUT. Pause. Blackness.
FADE IN:

rolling hills: a postcard slice of suburbia. SUPER the legend:"|stage direction

Street. Flanked by kids. Christmas carols, droning from
loudspeakers.
HAPPY, LAUGHING SANTA waves howdy, chortling his ""Ho's"" in
groups of three, meanwhile he's really a grizzled old fire
marshall named EARL, freezing his nuts off.
Beside him sits MRS. CLAUS, about whom we notice two things:
First, she's the June in this June/December pair -- and
second, she's to kill for, an effortlessly beautiful woman.
For the record, meet SAMANTHA CAINE."|stage direction

can't help it, snorts laughter --
THE ADULT DEER appears perfectly framed in the Sunbird's
headlights. Dead ahead. Sam looks up, face etched in sudden
TERROR. *No time to think*. SWERVES, no dice...! BROADSIDES
the animal --
And it comes THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. All two hundred and
fifteen pounds of it. Fucks up their night altogether.
Actually, it only makes it *halfway* through --
But the damn thing is ALIVE. More than alive. KICKING.
Thrashing. Squawling with pain and rage. A FLAILING HOOF
takes out Earl. Kills him in less than a second. Collapses
his skull.
Sam rides the wheel, screaming. An antler gouges her chest.
Rips. Draws blood. She SWERVES, madly -- Hits the tree doing
50.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Sam goes airborne. Explodes through the windshield, outward
bound. Shower of glass, spritz of blood... And then she's
flying. Slow motion, end over end... We lose all SOUND.
Silence as she tumbles. Below and behind her, the Sunbird
noiselessly ERUPTS. Fireball, sky high --
Sam floating. Describes a lazy arc in mid-air... Whoomph-!
Disappears into the snow. Swallows her, leaves a silhouette.
Around her, trees catch fire. Burn. She lies in her impromptu
sarcophagus. Out of sight.
THE FLAMING DEER totters from the wreck, thrashing. Scene
from a nightmare. Nightmare part two: from the snow, from
the human-shaped divot -- arises a woman of blood.
She stumbles from the drift. Toward the wreck. And though
it's clearly Sam Caine under all that crimson, there's
something wrong about her *eyes*.
En route to the car, she kneels beside the suffering deer,
its flesh scorched and torn -- and KILLS it. Puts it away
with a sharp CRACK-!ing blow to the head. Stands, eyes
squirming with madness...
The car's an inferno. Earl is dead. She turns away, wiping
blood from her eyes -- Comes face to face with a SNOWMAN.
A jolly white fellow. Charcoal briquettes for eyes. She
watches, fascinated, as he MELTS in the blast furnace heat --
With warning, she *screams*. Crumples to the ground.
The snowman's eyes fall out. He melts away and away..."|stage direction

the ice. Bound hand and foot. Strapped to the wheel, wearing
only a nightgown, she is utterly helpless.
