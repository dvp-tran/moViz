CROCKETT + ZITO
FIRE at the prone Coleman.  Coleman's dead.
WIDER:  THE FREIGHTERS - THE FIREFIGHT
continues as other NLR battle Miami SWAT.  Meanwhile...
CROCKETT
goes to Isabella, pulls her into the shadows away from
dockside, keeping her low, seemingly away from the police.
OK, how will they get out of here?
OVER CROCKETT + ISABELLA:  TUBBS
approaches from the left.  Tubbs and Crockett's eyes connect.
CLOSER:  TUBBS
sees his partner with this woman.  The frozen moment.
Isabella doesn't understand the changed expression on Tubbs'
face.  We do.
CROCKETT EYE TO EYE WITH HIS PARTNER
50 yards away.  All meaning is transmitted.  And Tubbs
nods...and the nod means:  ""get her out of here...""
As Tubbs speaks into his radio, his right arm belted where it
was slashed, heading towards the diminished firefight, now
under MPD control, as...
CROCKETT RACES ISABELLA AWAY
through the weeds and scrap, away from the firefight, away
from the freighters, AWAY FROM THE POLICE.  Beyond them, we
hear the gunfight diminishing."|stage direction||

stopped, their occupants seeking cover behind them.  Crockett
hesitates not at all.  He grabs a late '80's Mercedes left

curb, starts to object.  Crockett raises his gun.  Owner
