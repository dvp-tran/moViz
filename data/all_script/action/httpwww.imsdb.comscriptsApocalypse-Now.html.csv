1||"1  PRIMEVAL SWAMP - EARLY DAWN
It is very early in the dawn - blue light filters through
the jungle and across a foul swamp. A mist clings to the
trees. This could be the jungle of a million years ago.
Our VIEW MOVES CLOSER, through the mist, TILTING DOWN to
the tepid water. A small bubble rises to the surface;
then another. Suddenly, but quietly, a form begins to
emerge; a helmet. Water and mud pour off revealing a set
of beady eyes just above the mud. Printed on a helmet,
in a psychedelic  hand, are the words: ""Gook Killer.""
The head emerges revealing that the tough-looking soldier
beneath has  exceptionally long hair and beard; he has no
shirt on, only bandoliers of ammunition - his body is
painted in an odd camouflage pattern. He looks to the
right; he looks to the left; he looks INTO CAMERA, and
slowly sinks back into the swamp, disapperaring completely.
Our VIEW HOLDS, We begin to HEAR natural, though
unrecognizable JUNGLE SOUNDS, far off in the distance.
We PAN TO REVEAL a clump of logs half submerged in the
swamp; and part of what seems to be a Falstaff beer can
in the mud. A hand reaches out, and the beer can disappears.
As we TILT UP, we NOTICE that the log is hollow
and houses the rear of a M-60 machine gun, hand painted
in a paisley design.
Now the VIEW MOVES AWAY, ACROSS the ancient growth, PAST
the glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in
ambush, wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes.
ACROSS to a dark trail where the legs of those in black
pajamas move silently across our ever TIGHTENING VIEW.
Their feet, boots and sandals leave no impression; make
no sound. A slight flicker of light reveals a pair of
eyes in the foliage across the path, waiting and watching.
The VIEW PUSHES ALONG WITH the Vietnamese, MOVING FASTER
AND FASTER WITH them, until suddenly, directly in front
about ten feet away, an enormous AMERICAN clad in rags
and bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun
casually at his side, steps in front of them. He smiles
laconically, and BLASTS OUT FIVE SHOTS that rip THROUGH
US. By the second shot, the whole jungle blazes out
with AUTOMATIC FIRE.
Out VIEW TURNS as the men around us are thrown and torn,
screaming and scattering into the jungle. More AMERICANS
appear; unexplainably, out of the growth. It is now that
we fully SEE the bizarre manner in which they are dressed.
Some wear helmets, others wear strange hats made from
feathers and parts of animals. Some of them have long
savage-looking hair; other crew-cut or completely shaved;
they wear bandoliers, flak jackets, shorts and little else.
They wear Montagnard sandals or no shoes at all, and their
bodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns.
They appear one with the jungle and mist, FIRING INTO US
as they move.
The soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp, dripping
mud, his MACHINE GUN BLASTING FIRE.
We begin to move quickly with one Vietnamese, breathlessly
running for his life; we MOVE INTO the jungle with him,
only to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling AMERICAN
painted and wearing feathers like an Indian. OUR VIEW
FALLS WITH him to the ground, STARING UPWARDS, as FLAME
and EXPLODING MUD scatter above us. Men scream and die
around us. The screams amid the GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS
are piercing and terrible, as though the jungle itself is
frightened.
An AMERICAN wearing a jungle hat with a large Peace Sign
on it, wearing war paint, bends TOWARD US, reaching down
TOWARD US with a large knife, preparing to scalp the
dead.
OUR VIEW MOVES AWAY, along with the running sandals of a
Vietnamese soldier, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER, only to be
stopped by still another of the savage-looking AMERICANS
with primitive ornamentation, wearing only a loin-cloth
and green beret. He opens his flame-thrower directly ON US
and the NVA soldier and we are incinerated in flame,
bright psychedelic orange-red flame. Outrageous, loud,
electric ROCK MUSIC OVERWHELMS the SOUNDTRACK :"|stage direction

3||"2  TITLE SEQUENCE
The CREDIT TITLES proceed as the FLANE CONSUME US,
growing more intense, brighter, more vivid, purifying;
transforming into an intense white heat that we can barely
look at, like the sun itself.
Then it EXPLODES, breking apart, and shattering once
again. It begins to cool, as the TITLES CONTINUE. It
is as though WE ARE MOVING through the white center of
cooling flame, forming a spinning web, and becoming more
distant. The TITLES CONTINUE.
We are MOVING TOWARD planetary nebulae; MOVING through the
stars; MOVING closer to the Earth. We can BARELY HEAR the
MUSIC  now.
We MOVE CLOSER to the earth; beautiful, covered in clouds,
as though SEEN from a satellite. The TITLES CONTINUE.
We are MOVING CLOSER to the earth; through the soft clouds,
close enough that we can MAKE OUT the Western Hemisphere;
CLOSER to North America; CLOSER, to America, then California;
Los Angeles, STILL CLOSER to the odd, finger-like
shapes of :

The VIEW finally SETTLES ON a partically luxury cabin
cruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day.
It is large, pleasure boat: The people are relaxing in
bathing suits and towels and robes. They are drinking
cocktails, and snapping pictures. The boat belongs to the
head of a large American Corporation, and this is his
party. This man, CHARLIE, is sitting, his shirt off to
catch some of the late sun. Others have their faces
smeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war
paint. Charlie is going on and on :"|stage direction

A Vietnamese coastal fishing village built along the
beach and palm trees -- with rice paddies behind. This

Suddenly we HEAR the distant MUSIC -- Everyone stops;
they stare out to see. Men scream orders -- women run
from huts bearing ammunition and rifles -- Everywhere
there is activity to prepare for the defense of the
village.
Camouflage is removed from anti-aircraft emplacements.
People feverishly unlimber weapons of all types and run
to tunnels and trenches.

The canopy of trees grows taller and stretches out across
the river filtering the sun. The forest itself has grown

snake slips along an overheading limb. The depth of the
jungle is dark, ominous -- yet cool and strangely inviting.
196  FULL SHOT - BOAT - JUNGLE
Suddenly the river widens, the trees give way to marsh
and as they emerge into the light a strange shadow falls
upon the boat. It is the shadow cast by an enormous
vertical tail section of a B-52 bomber thrusting out from
the mud. Pieces of aluminum hang loosely from it, oxi-
dizing in the sun. Creepers have already started to grow
up around its heights -- the jungle is claiming it. But
once under its shadow, they have passed a gateway. A
gateway to paradise.
The river widens and the trees at its edge are soft and
seductive. The hills beyond are purple and lush. Strange
orange colored water-fowl swim lazily out of their way.
The water itself is glass smooth and black as if there
were no bottom. The sun is warm and the breeze gentle
and laced with wild gardenians. It is indeed the most
peaceful valley in all the world and each man looks upon
it and has never known such a sense of peace and well-
being.
Each man in his heart feels a need to stay -- his soul
cries to stop -- stop their madness -- this spiral into
hell.
Here is all that can be had of earth. But no hand moves.

Hundreds and hundreds of Montagnard natives -- dressed

about them, men and boys, standing passively watching
the small Navy craft flying the strange flag of red,
white and blue.

The men of the crew are not the same men who began this

The various decorations and paraphenelia that they have
picked up along the way seem oddly relevant to the
savages that stand before them. The Chef has made a
hat of birdfeathers; Lance's face has been painted with
mud under the eyes to block the glare of the sun. He
wears certain animal skins; trinkets; some animal teeth.

feathers -- which slowly and automatically gives away, in

As they proceed closer to the fortress-temple, men appear
where a moment before there was only jungle.
They are mostly Montagnards, but far more savage looking
than any we've seen before. They wear only loinclothes
and bandoliers of ammunition. their bodies are painted
in strange patterns. They carry Army M-16's, Russian
AK-47's and a wide variety of knives and clubs. Women
emerge from the brush as well. they are armed and
equally primitive looking. Interspersed among them
are a few taller men with paler skins, with the remnants
of Army insignia on them. The paint on their bodies is,
if anything more bizarre. We CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS
the entire group up to the stone gates of the fort,
where thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against
the sky. Willard and his men look up at people more
primitive and more savage than any since the time
of Captain Cook.
They encounter, in the center of the group, what once
appears to have been an American. he is tall, gaunt,
wears a flak jacket, but is otherwise naked, save a
loincloth. His face is darkened from dirt, battle smoke,
strange camouflage patterns. His hair and beard are
long, matted with mud and grease. He carries an AK-47
decorated with scalps and human ears. Willard approaches
this beast, who seems shy and retiring."|stage direction

primitive ornaments designating him a tribal chief, as
