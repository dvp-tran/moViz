razor-claws on metal... the hiss of pneumatic hoses...
the whirr and click of servos... liquid gurgling... an
eerie, alien cacophony."|stage direction

alien noises continue, and far in the distance we hear
the muffled THUMP of what could be a distant explosion.
Alien TEXT suddenly appears next to Earth, and we

5||"The image of Earth is actually on a monitor, which is
only one of DOZENS of MONITORS covering a huge wall.
We don't see anything of the rest of the room, but the
technology in view is distinctly alien and bizarre --
a mixture of organic and mechanical elements.
Circuitry and optical cabling are side-by-side with
what looks almost like arteries and organs. We can
still hear the creepy skittering and gurgling noises.
Occasionally, a SHADOWY FORM sweeps past the camera,
vaguely humanoid but we can't tell who or what it is.
All of the monitors are active, and they present myriad
IMAGES and SOUND -- all related to EARTH HISTORY. The
screens show everything from written Chinese... to
Renaissance paintings... to black and white newsreel
footage of World War Two... to what look like clips of
space battles from the 24th century. The entire range
of human history dancing across the monitors. The
effect is dizzying -- we get the feeling that whoever
is watching this is studying the human race.
There is another THUMP and the wall of monitors
SHUDDERS slightly. We hear the VOICE of what we will
come to know as the BORG COLLECTIVE -- thousands of
voices speaking at once :"|stage direction
6|BORG|"Restrict search parameters to 1-9-
9-8 through 2-0-8-4."|speech
7||"The images on the monitors now change to show us images
from 21ST CENTURY Earth history.
Again, it's a collection of still photography, video
footage, text, artwork, etc. We hear snippets of sound-
bites, music, speeches from the period. A lot of
enticing details. As the images race across the
monitors, we should learn the following.
-- The turn of the 21st century brought chaos.
Regional wars, the collapse of the United Nations.
Societal break-down. Crime, starvation, desperation.
-- A Third World War. Nuclear explosions,
environmental disasters, tens of millions dead. The
United States ceases to exist. All political authority
vanishes. Humanity teetering on the edge of the Second
Dark Age.
-- The image of a single man -- ZEPHRAM COCHRANE. A
visionary scientist. He see the spacecraft he created
out of a nuclear missile. He flies the first warp
test, breaking the light barrier. It changes history.
-- Grainy black and white images of a VULCAN SCOUT SHIP
landing on Earth. They saw Cochrane's flight, followed
him back to Earth, and made First Contact with the
human race.
-- Humanity turns the corner. First Contact with an
alien civilization brings the planet together as never
before. Humans and Vulcans working together, beginning
to solve long-standing problems with new technology.
We see an early replicator producing food for the
starving millions. A new World Government is formed.
-- People from planet Earth and people from Vulcan form
an Alliance. They call it the United Federation of
Planets. And they commission a fleet of starships for
protection and exploration. They call it Starfleet.
-- These are images recounting the birth of the Star
Trek universe.
Another muffled EXPLOSION, this one stronger, SHAKES
the entire wall. One of the monitors BLOWS OUT in a
shower of sparks. And now a new voice, a woman's
voice, low, threatening, with a slight metallic
inflection, speaks for the first time:"|stage direction

man/half machine. No individual personalities. No

assimilate new races into their collective. To become

attach a small pod to a Starfleet console and activate
it. The pod immediately sends out a COMPLEX WEB of
BORG TECHNOLOGY which covers the Starfleet console
inside and out. It's like weeds overpowering a flower
bed -- within seconds the console has been BORGIFIED.
The walls, ceiling and floor are now honeycombed with
the ALCOVES that make up the BORG COLLECTIVE. Borg

other conduits connecting them to various equipment...

Cochrane down the street toward the hospital at the
end. As they walk along, we get our first taste of
post-apocalyptic 21st century life:
This is a recognizable American community, but it's
definitely a futuristic town. Clothing, architecture,
technology -- all have changed over the course of
seventy years. But it is a broken future. What used
to be high-tech public COMPUTER TERMINALS are rusted
and abandoned. We can see the corroded hulks of HOVER-
CARS lying idle in the streets. Futuristic elements
now useless.
At one point, they pass a large polyurethane TENT --
the inside surface is covered with condensation and we
can see the silhouettes of people moving within. The
entrance is guarded by a single Militia Guard. Later
we will learn that this is a primitive greenhouse, the
only place where they can grow uncontaminated food.
What used to be a McDonald's, or some other
recognizable food chain, has now been gutted and has
been turned into a kind of blacksmith shop. People are
fashioning metal into various tools using hammer and
tongs.
The sidewalks are populated with PEOPLE, who congregate
in small groups, quietly talking amongst themselves,
others just staring vacantly off into space. Many of
them have visible burn scars and damage to their bodies --
victims of the war and post-nuclear environmental
dangers. A few of them are applying a special lotion
to their arms and face -- protection against the toxic
elements. A long FOOD LINE snakes around a block, as
people line up to get their daily rations.
A few people glance up at Picard and Beverly with
curious or suspicious looks. This is not a community
that welcomes strangers. At one point, they see a man
dressed in futuristic CAMOUFLAGE carrying an automatic
weapon -- we will learn he's a MILITIA SOLDIER. He
stares at them with a neutral expression, then walks
off.
The people here have that hollow-eyed, listless look
about them. They're going through something that makes
the Great Depression look like a minor inconvenience.
But there's also a toughness to these people, a
resilience and determination to survive in the face of
overwhelming odds. We are looking at our future... and

dark. He fumbles around for a light switch... finally
locates one... and a soft, golden glow fills the room.
The house has only one room, which functions as a
living room, kitchen, bedroom, etc. This is also
Ruby's DARKROOM. The windows have been painted black,
and there are photographic plates and futuristic photo-
equipment all around. But the most striking feature of
the house are the large, hanging cloth-printed
PHOTOGRAPHS. They vary in size and shape. Some are
hanging on walls, others hang from the ceiling in mid-
air, still others are stacked on the few pieces of
furniture that's here. The absence of paper has forced
Ruby to print photos on anything she can find --
bed sheets, shirts, pieces of upholstery, backs of
carpeting, etc. Picard stands there for a moment,
taking in the scene -- he's never been in anyplace
quite like this. The cloth photos give the room a
feeling of a small, intensely personal gallery.
Picard moves around the room, looking from photo to
photo... hunting for the elusive shots of the missile
silo... and as he does, we get our first close look at
Ruby's images, and they tell us a great deal about
her...
She has an artistic eye for finding beauty in the
mundane and the ugly. There are pictures of hope
amidst despair... beauty amongst devastation. There
seems to be a theme running through the photographs --
a romantic, almost idealistic sense of optimism.
At one point, Picard finds a photograph he recognizes.
It's the rusted-out hover car she photographed on the
streets of Resurrection. It's an ugly, decrepit piece
of junk... but there in the center, spot-lighted by a
single ray of sunshine... is a tiny flower about to
bloom.
Picard takes in the image for a brief moment... then
pushes onward... goes to a file of photos sitting in a
box... begins sorting through them quickly... we see
PRE-WAR photos printed on real paper. They show a
younger Ruby with her parents... Resurrection the way
it used to look... Ruby with a dog...
