1||INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREW'S ROOM|location||

its side, facing the door. We can hear someone moving around
off screen.
The door handle clicks; someone's trying it.    Then nothing.
Then, suddenly, loud pounding on the door.
Andrew's voice is scratchy and prone to cracking.   He speaks
with a rushed mix of fear and anxiety."|unknown||
