it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like
this constant questioning and re
questioning.  Do I end it?  Should I give
it more time?  I'm not happy, but what do
I expect?  Relationships require work.
You know the drill.  The thing that I
keep coming back to is, I'm not getting
any younger, I want to have a baby... at
some point... maybe... right?  So then I
think I should settle -- which is not
necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's
a good guy.  It's not really settling.
Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of
movies, y'know?  That I have some
completely unrealistic notion of what a
relationship can be.  But then I think,
no, this is what I really want, so I
should allow myself the freedom to go out
and fucking find it.  You know?  Agreed?
But then I think he is a good guy and...
It's complicated.  Y'know?"|speech

that's good."|speech

four years.  It's really cheap.  My
downstairs neighbor is old so she's
quiet, which is great.  And the

great, and I have a little porch in the

285|"CLEMENTINE

strictly grade school to me.  But this
made me cry for some reason.  Maybe
because it is grade school.  Y'know?"|speech

287|CLEMENTINE|"I miss grade school.  I don't know why
I'm calling it grade school all of a

elementary school.  But I like grade
school better.  Sounds like something
someone from the forties would call it.
I'd like to be from then.  Everyone wore
hats.  Anyway, cheers!"|speech

good."|speech

about that."|speech

several potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade

potato, a housewife potato.  Clementine returns with Joel's
drink and a refill for herself."|stage direction
316|JOEL|Thanks.|speech

318||Joel looks a little alarmed.|stage direction
319|CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)|I'm just kidding.  C'mon.|speech

drunkenly at him."|stage direction

322|JOEL|Yeah?|speech
323|CLEMENTINE|"Well, I go to a psychic and she's always
telling me I'm psychic.  She should know.
Do you believe in that stuff?"|speech
324|JOEL|I don't know.|speech
325|CLEMENTINE|"Me neither.  But sometimes I have
premonitions, so, I don't know.  Maybe
that's just coincidence.  Right?  Y'know,
you think something and then it happens,
or you think a word and then someone says
it?  Y'know?"|speech
326|JOEL|Yeah, I don't know.  It's hard to know.|speech
327|CLEMENTINE|"Exactly.  Exactly!  That's exactly my
feeling about it.  It's hard to know.
Like, okay, but how many times do I think
something and it doesn't happen?  That's
what you're saying, right?  You forget
about those times.  Right?"|speech
328|JOEL|Yeah, I guess.|speech
329|"CLEMENTINE
(dreamy beat)"|But I think I am.  I like to think I am.|speech
330|CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)|"It's helpful to think there's some order
to things.  You're kind of closed

331|JOEL|"Sorry.  My life isn't that interesting.
I go to work.  I go home.  I don't know
what to say."|speech
332|CLEMENTINE|Oh.|speech
333|(considers this)|"Does that make you sad?  Or anxious?  I'm
always anxious thinking I'm not living my
life to the fullest, y'know?  Taking
advantage of every possibility?  Just
making sure that I'm not wasting one
second of the little time I have."|speech
334|JOEL|I think about that.|speech
335||"She looks at him really hard for a long moment.  Joel tries
to hold her gaze, but can't.  He looks down at his drink.
Clementine starts to cry again."|stage direction
336|CLEMENTINE|"You're really nice.  I'm sorry I yelled
at you before about it.  God, I'm an
idiot."|speech
337|JOEL|"I do have a tendency to use that word too
much."|speech
338|CLEMENTINE|"I like you.  That's the thing about my
psychic thing.  I think that's my
greatest psychic power, that I get a
sense about people.  My problem is I
never trust it.  But I get it.  And with
you I get that you're a really good guy."|speech
339|JOEL|Thanks.|speech
340|CLEMENTINE|"And, anyway, you sell yourself short.  I
can tell.  There's a lot of stuff going
on in your brain.  I can tell.  My
goal... can I tell you my goal?"|speech
341|JOEL|Yeah.|speech
342|"CLEMENTINE
(ala Paul Simon)"|What's the goal, Joel?|speech
343|(laughs)|"My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow
through me?  Do you know what I mean?
It's like, there's all these emotions and
ideas and they come quick and they change
and they leave and they come back in a
different form and I think we're all
taught we should be consistent.  Y'know?
You love someone -- that's it.  Forever.
You choose to do something with your life
-- that's it, that's what you do.  It's a
sign of maturity to stick with that and
see things through.  And my feeling is
that's how you die, because you stop
listening to what is true, and what is
true is constantly changing.  You know?"|speech
344|JOEL|Yeah.  I think so.  It's hard to --|speech
345|CLEMENTINE|"Like I wanted to talk to you.  I didn't
need any more reason to do it.  Who knows
what bigger cosmic reason might exist?"|speech
346|JOEL|Yeah.|speech
347|CLEMENTINE|"You're very nice.  God, I have to stop
saying that.  You're nervous around me,
huh?"|speech
348|JOEL|No.|speech
349|CLEMENTINE|"I'm nervous.  You don't need to be
nervous around me, though.  I like you.
Do you think I'm repulsively fat?"|speech
350|JOEL|No, not at all.|speech
351|CLEMENTINE|"I don't either.  I used to.  But I'm
through with that.  Y'know, if I don't
love my body, then I'm just lost.  You
know?"|speech
352|CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)|"With all the wrinkles and scars and the
general falling apart that's coming
'round the bend."|speech
353|(beat)|So, I've been seeing this guy...|speech
354||Joel looks slightly crestfallen.|stage direction
355|"CLEMENTINE (CONT'D)
(off his reaction)"|"Well, for the last week, anyway!  He's
kind of a kid.  Kind of a goofball, but
he's really stuck on me, which is
flattering.  Who wouldn't like that?  And
he's, like, a dope, but he says these
smart and moving things sometimes, out of
nowhere, that just break my heart.  He's
the one who gave me that crow photograph."|speech
356|JOEL|Oh, yeah.|speech
357|CLEMENTINE|"That made me cry.  But, anyway, we went
up to Boston, because I had this urge to
lie on my back on the Charles River.  It
gets frozen this time of year."|speech
358|JOEL|That's scary sounding.|speech
359|CLEMENTINE|"Exactly!  I used to do it in college and
I had this urge to go do it again, so I
got Patrick and we drove all night to get
there and he was sweet and said nice
things to me, but I was really
disappointment to be there with him.
Y'know?  And that's where psychic stuff
comes in.  Like, it just isn't right with
him.  Y'know?"|speech
360|JOEL|I think so.|speech
361|CLEMENTINE|"I don't believe in that soulmate crap
anymore, but... he says so many great
things.  We like the same writers.  This
writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to.
And he's cute.  It's fucked up.  Joel,
you should come up to the Charles with me
sometime."|speech
362|JOEL|Okay.|speech
363|CLEMENTINE|Yeah?  Oh, great!|speech

do that?  I would like that."|speech

in his pocket.  He stands there uncomfortably for a moment,
then forces himself to speak."|stage direction

of a tube.  I think the hair is just... a
pretty topping."|speech

surprised and pleased and nervous."|stage direction

happened.  Those who do not remember
