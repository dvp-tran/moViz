In an e-mail to the New York
Times, a Marxist extremist known
only as 'The Wolf,' states that
the bombing was, quote, 'not an
act of terror but an act of war,
aimed at stopping your C.I.A.
murderers and their fascist puppets
from committing further acts of
repression against the people of
Colombia,' unquote... Two
Colombian officials and an
American military officer died
in last Thursday's blast. Also
killed were Anne Pitt, wife of a
New York City firefighter, and
their only child, four-year-old
Matt... The President has vowed
that the United States will avenge
what he called 'this monstrous act
of barbarism and cowardice'...
Intelligence sources say the
identity and whereabouts of The
Wolf remain a mystery. They
believe he has worked closely with
radical elements in Latin America
for more than twenty years and
have linked him to numerous
terrorist bombings, including the
1983 downing of a Peruvian
airliner, which killed forty-two
people, eleven of them
Americans... The head of the Latin
America Indigenous People's
Committee, a group known to be
