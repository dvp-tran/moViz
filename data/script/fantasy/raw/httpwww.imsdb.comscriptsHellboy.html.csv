A hail of bullets cuts down a dozen Nazis. The Allies overrun
the machine gun nest as grenades explode everywhere.
VON KRUPT shoots wildly, hitting Broom in the leg. But
Whitman's bullets rip into the old Nazi's chest.
Leaving a trail of blood, Broom crawls to a dead G.I. and
grabs a grenade from his belt.
TCHKKK!!! Kroenen extends two gleaming blades from twin steel
bands on his wrists and takes on an entire group of soldiers,
mowing through them with swords spinning like deadly rotors.
The steel chops clean through their weapons.
Broom pulls the pin and throws the grenade at the generator.
CLICK-CLACK!! It wedges itself between two moving tie rods.
Kroenen squeals and -- retracting his blades -- lunges after
it. The gyrating rails slice through his leather jacket. As
his fingers reach the grenade, it EXPLODES!!!
Kroenen flies through the air, hitting a stone wall, where
two long pieces of shrapnel pin him like an insect.
Another rail plunges -- FFFFT!!, like a javelin -- into the

Grigory and Ilsa are gone. And for now, so is Kroenen.
Embedded in the wall where he was pinned, two bloody rails,

THING shrinks back.
Broom bites into the candy and chews, noisily smacking his
lips. Offers the candy again. This time, out of the dark

around it.
The creature extends its right arm: it's solid stone with

As he arcs back down, ABM!! -- he cracks the floor wide open.
Next to him: the rosary and the EXPLOSIVE BELTS. He tries to
grab them. The tentacle slams down, blocking his way.
The vibration sends the belts down into the crack. They bounce
off a small ledge and land further down. Far below, grinding
cogwheels and gears.
Hellboy manages to pull a steel sword from the closest marble
statue.
Hellboy stands up and swings the sword for all he's worth.
FWAP! He cuts clean through the tentacle. The tip hits the
floor, rolling into the crack.
From out of Behemoth's stump... a mass of wriggling tentacles
replaces the cut-off section! They squirm around Hellboy's
face as he slashes, again and again, fighting his way forward.
He leans into the crack, stretches his arm, struggling to
grab the belts. A few inches short. He jumps into the crevice,
onto the first ledge. It crumbles!!
The gears below grind a few falling bricks. The belts slide
away.
A tentacle captures Hellboy, pulls him up. At the last second,
he grabs the belts with his tail.
The beast raises Hellboy high. A multi-layered mouth opens
in the body of BEHEMOTH. The most horrible proboscis ever
