1   INT. DARK CHAMBER -- NIGHT                                     1
Foreboding organ music is heard...
We are looking down at a rough brick floor ... is it an
alley? ... a cobblestone street? ... a warehouse? a factory?
... we're not sure...
The flickering glow of flame is the only illumination...
The ominous organ music continues as...
From the bottom of the frame...
A dark pool of blood slowly begins to spread ... moving up
the frame, defying gravity ... the flickering flame reflected
in the blood...
Finally, the pool of blood fills the entire frame.
SUDDENLY--
A shrill factory whistle blows--
ENORMOUSLY LOUD -- blood-chilling and spine-shattering --
the whistle is a bizarre combination of sound: a factory
whistle; a hog being slaughtered; a dog snarling; a roaring
inferno; a human scream--
And a man's face appears, upside down, reflected in the pool
of blood.
He is THE GENTLEMAN, a slender dandy in pearl grey gloves and
matching waistcoat. A cold and superior aristocrat.
The camera slowly revolves -- the Gentleman becoming right
side up as--
GENTLEMAN
Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd.
His skin was pale and his eye was odd.
He shaved the faces of gentlemen
Who never thereafter were heard of again.
He trod a path that few have trod,
Did Sweeney Todd,
The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.
We cut from the blood to see the Gentleman standing before
us. Strangely impassive.
We are in an eerie dark chamber, unclear, a low ceiling, a
world of silhouettes and shadows.

Another figure emerges from the miasma of shadows, into the
hellish flickering of flame: THE BANKER. He is large, rotund
and sleek. Impressive muttonchops.
BANKER
He kept a shop in London town,
Of fancy clients and good renown,
And what if none of their souls were saved?
They went to their maker impeccably shaved...
More FIGURES begin to emerge from the shadows, joining the
Gentleman and the Banker as...
BANKER
By Sweeney,
By Sweeney Todd,
The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.
Although prosaic in appearance these figures are, in fact,
GHOSTS.
GHOSTS
Swing your razor wide, Sweeney!
Hold it to the skies!
Freely flows the blood of those
Who moralize!
As they continue, the new figures become more distinct...
THE GENERAL, a tough, leather-skinned military man in a
crimson imperial uniform...
GENERAL
His needs were few, his room was bare:
THE PRIEST, a lean, severe man with pale skin in clerical
attire...
PRIEST
A lavabo and a fancy chair...
THE TOURIST, a small, meek man with glasses in an ill-fitting
suit...
TOURIST
A mug of suds and a leather strop,
An apron, a towel, a pail and a mop...
THE STUDENT, a dashing young man from Oxford with luxurious
long hair...

Back of his smile, under his word,
Sweeney heard music that nobody heard.
Sweeney pondered and Sweeney planned,

Sweeney was smooth, Sweeney was subtle,
Sweeney would blink and rats would scuttle...
The specters are becoming more insistent, their strange
impassivity giving way to accusation as the flickering red
flame becomes an inferno--

Sweeeeeneeeeey!
On this explosive note we revolve -- away from the ghostly
Furies--
To discover--
SWEENEY TODD. Standing before us. An unclear figure,
silhouetted in blazing red flames.
We slowly push in on him as:
GHOSTS
Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd.
He served a dark and a vengeful god.
What happened then--

On this note, we push in tight on the figure of Todd...
Music and the clanging of a clock tower bell are heard as we
slowly begin pulling back and are imperceptibly transported
to...
2   EXT. SHIP -- THAMES -- ALMOST DAWN                             2
ANTHONY, a young sailor of about 20, is standing at the rail
of a ship. We see the obscure shape of rigging and sails
behind him. The cries of sailors echo.
Behind him stand the GENTLEMAN and the BANKER. They are
looking past Anthony, looking at something. They move away as
Anthony peers through the fog, straining to see...
London.
Gradually, as the ship approaches, the towering spires and
mountainous rooftops of the city begin to stand out in
relief, to emerge through the fog like a tiger creeping
toward its prey.
Music continues as Anthony takes in the dreadful and
magnificent spectacle of the 19th Century metropolis. The
gnarl of rooftops. The labyrinth of streets and alleys. The
black trails of smoke reaching up like skeletal fingers from
a thousand chimneys.
London. Sulfurous London.
Anthony is awestruck.
ANTHONY
I have sailed the world, beheld its wonders
From the Dardanelles
To the mountains of Peru,
But there's no place like London--!
Then--

Sweeney Todd steps to Anthony's side, grimly interrupting--
TODD
No, there's no place like London.
ANTHONY
Mr. Todd...?
TODD
You are young.
Life has been kind to you.
You will learn.
Todd's glares forward, his haunted gaze never leaving the
approaching city.
3   EXT. DOCKS -- DAWN                                             3
Music continues as Todd stands very still and takes in the
shadowy figures on the docks.
Anthony seems almost lost at his side, overwhelmed by the
scale and aura of the city.
ANTHONY
Lord ... takes your breath away,
doesn't it?
Todd shudders violently, almost snarling.
TODD
There's a hole in the world
Like a great black pit
And the vermin of the world
Inhabit it
And its morals aren't worth
What a pig could spit
And it goes by the name Of London.
At the top of the hole
Sit the privileged few
Making mock of the vermin
In the lower zoo,
Turning beauty into filth and greed.
I too
Have sailed the world, and seen its wonders
For the cruelty of men
Is as wondrous as Peru,
But there's no place like London!
Anthony looks at his friend, mystified by his grim reaction
to the city.

TODD
I beg your indulgence, Anthony ... My
mind is far from easy. In these once
familiar streets I feel shadows
everywhere...
ANTHONY
Shadows...?
TODD
Ghosts.
Anthony looking at him, questioning. Todd continues quietly:
TODD
There was a barber and his wife,
And she was beautiful,
A foolish barber and his wife,
She was his reason and his life,
And she was beautiful,
And she was virtuous.
And he was...
(a breath)
Naive.
Anthony watches, rapt, as Todd remembers...
4   EXT. FLOWER MARKET -- FLASHBACK -- DAY                         4
...Fifteen years before.
Todd walks with his beautiful wife LUCY through a crowded
flower market, a colorful explosion of blossoms. Lucy carries
their one-year-old baby, JOHANNA.
Todd is almost unrecognizable to us, content and smiling.
Chatting with his wife. Happy.
TODD (V.O.)
There was another man who saw
That she was beautiful,
A pious vulture of the law,
Who with a gesture of his claw
Removed the barber from his plate.
Then there was nothing but to wait
And she would fall,
So soft,
So young,
So lost,
And oh, so beautiful!

During the above, JUDGE TURPIN, an elderly man with a
saturnine demeanor, eyes Lucy through the luxurious bunches
of flowers. He stalks her, desiring her.
With the Judge is his nefarious creature, BEADLE BAMFORD. The
Beadle is a large man, his florid nature and pink, powdered
face never quite disguising his lethality.
The Judge whispers to the Beadle, indicating Todd. Then the
Beadle and several policemen sweep in and drag Todd off. The
Judge moves in on Lucy like a predator.
And we return to...
5   EXT. DOCKS -- DAWN                                             5
Music continues.
ANTHONY
And the lady, sir ... did she succumb?
TODD
Oh, that was many years ago...
I doubt if anyone would know.
A quiet beat.
TODD
I owe you my life, Anthony. If you
hadn't spotted me, I would be lost on
the ocean still ... Thank you.
Todd picks up his duffel bag, preparing to go.
ANTHONY
Will I see you again?
TODD
You might find me, if you like, around
Fleet Street.
ANTHONY
Until then, my friend.
He offers his hand. Todd takes it and shakes.
Then Todd quickly turns and goes.
Anthony stands for a moment, saddened by the mysterious pall
that hangs over his friend.

6   EXT. STREET -- MORNING                                         6
Todd strides along, deep in thought. The emotions roiling
within him finally seethe out in a dark mutter:
TODD
There's a hole in the world
Like a great black pit
And it's filled with people
Who are filled with shit
And the vermin of the world
Inhabit it...
He disappears down the street as the music THUNDERS--
7   EXT. LONDON ASSAULT -- DAY                                     7
--We ZOOM ahead of Todd -- cutting through the city at
lightning pace down twisting alleys and up crowded boulevards
-- into tunnels and over bridges -- slashing through London
at breakneck speed -- the insane explosion of music sending
us hurtling to--
8   EXT. THE PIE SHOP -- DAY                                       8
Fleet Street.
We see the exterior of Mrs. Lovett's pie shop. It is tatty
and unloved by all. Yet it has a strange, ghostly presence to
it. Imposing and dead at the same time.
There is an exterior staircase leading up to a darkened
second floor room with a window overlooking the street.
The music slows and continues as we see Todd, standing in
front of the shop, considering it deeply.
The GENERAL we saw before passes, glancing at Todd. Here and
then gone.
Todd finally strides to the shop and enters...
9   INT. PIE SHOP -- DAY                                           9
Behind the dusty counter is...
MRS. LOVETT, a venal, vigorous and slatternly woman in her
40's.
She is currently busy chopping a loathsome mess of suet with
a wicked looking knife, her greasy hair hanging down over her
face.

The moment Todd enters -- and the bell at the door sounds --
her head snaps up and her eyes are on him like a bird of
prey:
MRS. LOVETT
A customer!
Todd is startled, starts to go--
MRS. LOVETT
Wait! What's yer rush?
What's yer hurry?
(She sticks the knife into
the counter)
You gave me such a--
(Wipes her hands on her
apron) )
Fright. I thought you was a ghost.
Half a minute, can'tcher?
Sit!
Sit ye down!
(An order)
Sit!
(He obeys)
All I meant is that I
Haven't seen a customer for weeks.
Did you come here for a pie, sir?
(Todd nods. She flicks a
bit of dust off a pie
with a rag)
Do forgive me if me head's a little vague--
Ugh!
(She plucks something off
the pie, examines it)
What is that?
But you'd think we had the plague--
(She drops it on the floor
and stamps on it)
From the way that people--
(She flicks something off
the pie with her finger)
Keep avoiding--
(Spotting it moving)
No, you don't!
(She smacks it with her
hand)
Heaven knows I try, sir!
(Lifts her hand, looks at
it)
Tsk!
(She wipes it on the edge
of the counter)
But there's no one comes in even to inhale--

She has created a modest outdoor eating garden with tables,
surrounded by glowing Chinese lanterns. A fresh coat of
paint, a few bushes in pots and birds in cages add to the
feeling of upward mobility.
A new sign hangs proudly over the entrance to the pie shop:
""MRS. LOVETT'S WORLD FAMOUS MEAT PIES!"" And then in smaller
letters: ""LIKE MOTHER USED TO MAKE.""
The eating garden is already crowded, the benches at the
tables are filled and other customers stand and mill about.
All eating, eating, eating...
...The most delicious looking meat pies you could ever
imagine. Crispy crust. Thick, luxurious gravy. Tart and tangy
meat.
The customers take great, hungry mouthfuls; the steaming
gravy oozing down greedy faces.
Chomp. Chomp. Chomp.
The Beggar Women stands across the street, ravenously hungry.
She finally gets the nerve to approach when--
Toby -- wearing a spiffy new outfit with apron -- bursts from
the shop and circulates through the customers:"|stage direction||

May I have your attention, perlease?
Are your nostrils aquiver and tingling as well
At that delicate, luscious ambrosial smell?

deliver this letter! DO YOU
UNDERSTAND?!
Toby is stunned and terrified. It is the first time he has
seen this side of his friend, Mr. Todd.
Todd releases him. Toby races out.
Todd immediately begins pacing like a caged animal, back and
forth, back and forth, whispering to himself neurotically, as
day becomes evening...
101   EXT. PIE SHOP -- EVENING                                      101
Toby walks back to the pie shop, upset.
He stops when he sees Todd at the window above, unblinking,
gazing like a falcon into the street.
He continues on to Mrs. Lovett, who is clearing up the
remains of a meal in the outdoor garden.

MRS. LOVETT
Where you been, lad? We had quite the
luncheon rush! Me poor bones is ready
to drop...
(She looks at him, notes
his dark expression.)
What is it, Toby?
He sits. She sits next to him.
TOBY
Mr. Todd sent me on an errand ... And
on the way back I went by the
workhouse. And I was thinkin' ... But
for you I would be there now. Or
someplace worse.
A beat.
TOBY
Seems like the Good Lord sent you for
me.
MRS. LOVETT
Oh, love, I feel quite the same way--
TOBY
Hear me out, mum ... You know there's
nothing I wouldn't do for you. Say, if
there was someone around -- someone
bad -- only you didn't know it--
MRS. LOVETT
(concerned)
What is this? What are you talking
about?
TOBY
Nothing's gonna harm you,
Not while I'm around.
Nothing gonna harm you,
No, sir,
Not while I'm around...
MRS. LOVETT
What do you mean, ""someone bad""?
TOBY
Demons are prowling
Everywhere
Nowadays.
I'll send 'em howling,

101   CONTINUED: (2)                                             101
I don't care--
I got ways.
MRS. LOVETT
Darling, hush now, there's no need for
this...
TOBY
No one's gonna hurt you,
No one's gonna dare.
Others can desert you--
Not to worry--
Whistle, I'll be there.
Demons'll charm you
With a smile
For a while,
But in time
Nothing can harm you,
Not while I'm around.
Music continues:
MRS. LOVETT
What is this foolishness now? What are
you talking about?
TOBY
Little things wot I been thinking ...
About Mr. Todd...
Not to worry, not to worry,
I may not be smart but I ain't dumb.
I can do it,
Put me to it,
Show me something I can overcome.
Not to worry, mum.
He leans into her, she puts her arms around him, but her
expression is deeply troubled.
TOBY
Being close and being clever
Ain't like being true,
I don't need to,
I won't never
Hide a thing from you,
Like some.
Music continues as she nervously comforts him:
MRS. LOVETT
Now, Toby dear, haven't we had enough
of this foolish chatter? ...

MRS. LOVETT (cont'd)
(reaching for her purse)
... Here, how about I give you a shiny
new penny and you can fetch us some
nice toffees--?
She pulls Pirelli's chatelaine purse from her dress--
TOBY
That's Signor Pirelli's purse!
MRS. LOVETT
No, no, love -- this is just something
Mr. T. give me for my birthday--
TOBY
See that proves it -- what I been
thinkin'--
(He stands, urgently
pulling her hand)
We gotta go, ma'am, right now -- we
gotta find the Beadle and get the law
here--
She pulls him down to her again, agitated, her mind racing:
MRS. LOVETT
Hush now, Toby, hush ... Here, you
just sit next to me nice and quiet ...
(calming)
... How could you think such a thing
of Mr. Todd, who's been so good to us?
He calms down a bit as she holds him.
And she comes to a painful, dreadful decision.
MRS. LOVETT
Nothing's gonna harm you,
Not while I'm around.
Nothing's gonna harm you, darling,
Not while I'm around.
(He leans into her)
Demons'll charm you
With a smile
For a while,
But in time
Nothing's gonna harm you,
Not while I'm around.
The music continues as she holds him. There are tears in her
eyes. But we see that her gentle song has calmed him.

MRS. LOVETT
(softly)
Funny we should be having this little
chat right now ... 'Cause I was just
thinkin', you know how you've always
fancied coming into the bakehouse with
me to help make the pies?
TOBY
(dreamily)
Yes, ma'am.
She quickly dries her eyes and then turns him to look at her.
MRS. LOVETT
(smiles)
Well ... no time like the present.
102   INT. BAKEHOUSE STEPS -- EVENING                            102
Mrs. Lovett leads Toby down the claustrophobic, long stairway
toward the bakehouse.
TOBY
My heart bleeds for you havin' to go
up and down all these stairs!
MRS. LOVETT
Well, that'll be your job now.
TOBY
Yes, ma'am!
She arrives at the heavy iron door to the bakehouse. We can
hear the seismic rumble of the bake oven within.
She unbolts the door and ushers Toby in.
And we finally enter...
103   INT. THE BAKEHOUSE -- EVENING                              103
A macabre vision of Hell.
The roof hangs low in this subterranean chamber. The grisly
tools of her trade are scattered about the place: a large,
stained chopping block; a meat grinder; buckets of
questionable viscous liquid; cleavers and bone saws and meat
hooks; wet sewer grates for the blood.
A metal sheet, hinged at the top, has been attached to cover
an opening in the wall: the mouth of the chute from the
barber shop above.

103   CONTINUED:                                                  103
And eeriest of all ... the thundering roar of flame coming
from a large industrial oven against one wall.
Toby takes in the cavernous bakehouse:
TOBY
Coo, quite a stink, ain't there?
She indicates the sewer grates:
MRS. LOVETT
Those grates go right down to the
sewers and the whiffs come up, always
a few rats gone home to Jesus down
there.
TOBY
So -- where do I start?!
She leads him across to the thrumming, fiery oven:
MRS. LOVETT
Now this would be the bake oven ...
Ten dozen at a time. Always be sure
the doors is closed properly, like
this.
TOBY
(trying to remember it
all)
Yes'm, always closed properly.
She leads him to the meat grinder:
MRS. LOVETT
And here's the grinder ...
(demonstrates it)
... You pop in the meat, give it a
good grind and it comes out here.
TOBY
(practicing with the
grinder)
Good grind, comes out there.
MRS. LOVETT
That's my boy. Smoothly, smoothly --
Now I've got to pop upstairs, back in
two shakes, all right?
TOBY
Yes'm.

She begins to go. He stops her with:
TOBY
Do you think I might have a pie while
I wait?
She turns. He is standing at a rack of cooling pies.
MRS. LOVETT
As many as you like, son ... As many
as you like.
She goes and shuts the door behind her.
104    INT. BAKEHOUSE STEPS -- EVENING                            104
She leans against the bakehouse door, tormented, gasping for
air. Then she slowly bolts the door.
A120
105   INT. FOGG'S ASYLUM -- EVENING                              105
A cacophony of madness. The ragged inmates of the asylum are
slammed together in a series of cramped cells, the low
ceiling pressing down.
We discover Anthony, dressed as a fashionable wigmaker,
walking past the cells with the odious MR. FOGG. Fogg carries
a large pair of scissors.
FOGG
... Oh yes, sir, I agree it would be
to our mutual interest to come to some
arrangement in regard to my poor
children's hair.
He moves to one of the cells and unlocks it:
FOGG
I keep the blondes over here. It was
yellow hair you was looking for, sir?
ANTHONY
Yes.
Fogg goes into the crowded cell -- the inmates, all blonde
women, scurry back, clearly terrified of Fogg. Anthony sees
Johanna, wearing a filthy straitjacket, hunched like a feral
animal, cowering in a corner of the cell.
ANTHONY
(points)
That one has hair the shade I need.

Fogg goes to fetch Johanna, hauls her to Anthony:
FOGG
Come, child. Smile for the gentleman
and you shall have a sweetie.
Johanna's eyes shoot wide when she sees Anthony, but she says
nothing.
FOGG
(prepares scissors)
Now, where shall I cut?
Before Fogg can react -- Anthony pulls a revolver from his
clothing, grabs Johanna and pushes Fogg back into the cell.
He swings the cell door shut, locking Fogg in.
ANTHONY
Not a word, Mr. Fogg, or it will be
your last ... Now, I leave you to the
mercy of your ""children.""
He grabs Johanna and pulls her away.
Mr. Fogg turns. He is locked in with the blonde inmates. They
slowly begin to advance on him. Menacing. It is likely they
are going to rip him limb from limb...
106   EXT. PIE SHOP -- EVENING                                      106
Todd and Mrs. Lovett are hurrying down the stairs from the
barber shop, urgent. Todd has a razor.
MRS. LOVETT
... I got him locked in -- but if he
escapes he'll go to the law!
TODD
Then he can't escape.
MRS. LOVETT
Mr. T. -- I don't know -- maybe we
could--
TODD
The Judge will be here soon! I have no
time, woman! Come on--!
They turn a corner and walk straight into--
The Beadle!

MRS. LOVETT
Excuse me, sir! -- You gave me a
fright.
BEADLE
Not my intention, good madam, though I
am here on official business.
(elaborately prepares a
pinch of snuff)
You see, there's been complaints.
About the stink from your chimney.
They say at night, it's something most
foul. Health regulations -- and the
general public welfare, naturally --
being my duty, I'm afraid I'll have to
take a look ...
(inhales the snuff,
Sneezes and daintily
wipes his nose)
... at your bakehouse.
TODD
(smoothly)
Of course ... But first why don't you
come upstairs and let me attend to
you?
BEADLE
Much as I do appreciate tonsorial
adornment, I really ought see to my
""official"" obligations first.
TODD
An admirable sentiment -- But I must
ask you, out of professional curiosity
you understand, is that a cream or a
tallow pomade?
BEADLE
(touches his hair)
Oh, not a pomade at all! Me secret is
a touch of ambergris.
TODD
But, sir, hair that delicate requires
a genuine pomade! Come along, let me
show you the difference.
BEADLE
(considering)
Well ... you are the expert in these
matters...

TODD
And we'll finish you off with a nice
facial rub of bay rum.
BEADLE
Oooh, bay rum is bracing.
TODD
And all on the house, for my friend,
Beadle Bamford.
BEADLE
Well, sir, I take that very kindly ...
Lead on.
TODD
(bowing)
I am, sir, entirely at your --
(his eyes flit to Mrs.
Lovett)
-- disposal.
He leads the Beadle away.
Mrs. Lovett allows herself a breath.
107   EXT. PIE SHOP -- EVENING                                   107
From across the street, we see Todd leading the Beadle up the
stairs to the barber shop, chatting with him easily.
We realize we are seeing the perspective of the Beggar Woman,
hunched across the street, watching them closely.
108   INT. BAKEHOUSE -- EVENING                                  108
Toby is eating a pie as he slowly wanders around the
bakehouse.
He stops to consider the many stained cleavers and bone saws,
curious.
Then he bites on something hard -- stops -- he reaches into
his mouth and pulls something out. Looks at it:
It is a fingernail.
To be exact, it is the severed tip of a finger.
Toby drops it in horror and starts back--
Suddenly, a loud THUMPING and CLANGING makes him spin,
alarmed--

As --
The bloody body of the Beadle EXPLODES SUDDENLY from the
mouth of the chute--
Toby screams and races to the door--
Pulls at it. Locked. No use. He bangs on the heavy iron door
wildly:
TOBY
MRS. LOVETT! MRS. LOVETT! LET ME OUT!
MRS. LOVETT!
The thundering roar from the bake oven seems to rise to match
his frenzy as--
In panic, Toby races to the sewer grate, yanks it up and
disappears down into the sewers as the shrill factory whistle
SCREAMS and we cut to--
109   INT. BARBER SHOP -- EVENING                                   109
Todd stands by the chair, his razor high--
His eyes blazing--
His face covered in a spray of blood--
Lost in rapture.
Not for long.
The Gentleman, the Banker, the General move into the frame
with purpose, impatient.
The Gentleman flicks out his handkerchief and begins to clean
the blood off Todd's face -- he is not gentle, the blood
smears--
GENTLEMAN
The engine roared, the motor hissed,
And who could see how the road would twist...?
Meanwhile, the Banker pulls off Todd's stained barber tunic
and hands Todd his jacket--
BANKER
In Sweeney's ledger the entries matched:
A Beadle arrived, and a Beadle dispatched...
Meanwhile, the General is cleaning up the blood on the barber
chair--

Of Sweeney Todd...
GENTLEMAN, BANKER AND GENERAL
The Demon Barber of Fleet...
SUDDENLY -- a sharp cry from across the room -- Todd spins--
OTHER GHOSTS (O.S.)
SWEENEY!
GENTLEMAN, BANKER AND GENERAL
...Street!
Todd sees that more and more of the ghastly specters are
moving around the room -- multiplying exponentially -- we see
the TOURIST, the STUDENT, the PRIEST and others.
They are more intrusive than they have ever been -- touching
Todd -- eagerly preparing him for the finale of his drama --
GHOSTS
(variously)
Sweeney! Sweeney!
Sweeney! Sweeney! Sweeney!
By now the ghosts are fully Furies, demented and threatening--
GHOSTS
Sweeney!
Sweeeeeeneeeeey...!
The screeching music transforms into a strange symphony of
inarticulate moans and howls and chants, taking us to...

Todd and Mrs. Lovett are searching for Toby through a
horrible catacomb of decaying sewers. Todd carries a razor.

111   INT. BARBER SHOP -- NIGHT                                     111
Anthony and Johanna hurry into the barber shop. She is now
dressed as a scruffy boy, a cap hiding her hair. She is
distracted and disturbed.
ANTHONY
Mr. Todd...? No matter. You wait for
him here -- I'll return with the coach
in less than half an hour...
She gently touches Todd's collection of razors...
ANTHONY
Don't worry, darling, in those
clothes, no one will recognize you ...
You're safe now.

She picks up the largest razor, looks at it, an eerie echo of
her father.
JOHANNA
(darkly ironic)
Safe ... So we run away and then all
our dreams come true?
ANTHONY
I hope so...
JOHANNA
I have never had dreams. Only
nightmares.
ANTHONY
Johanna ... When we're free of this
place all the ghosts will go away.
She looks at him very intensely:
JOHANNA
No, Anthony, they never go away.
He gently touches her face.
ANTHONY
I'll be right back to you ... Half an
hour and we'll be free.
He goes.
She turns to the window, watches him go. Her expression is
sad: he will never fully comprehend her depth.
Then she sees the Beggar Woman approaching from across the
street...
112   EXT. PIE SHOP -- NIGHT                                       112
The Beggar Woman begins climbing the stairs to the barber
shop:
BEGGAR WOMAN
Beadle ... Beadle ...
No good hiding, I saw you!
Are you in there still?

BEGGAR WOMAN (V.O.)
Beadle ... Beadle...
Johanna looks around urgently, sees the large chest. She
quickly climbs into it and shuts the lid as--
The Beggar Woman enters.
BEGGAR WOMAN
Beadle dear, Beadle...
The room has a strange effect on her, as if she were vaguely
recalling some distant dream. She intones to pretty lullaby
music...
BEGGAR WOMAN
Beadle deedle deedle deedle deedle dumpling,
Beadle, dumpling, Be-deedle dumpling...
SUDDENLY--
Without warning -- like a thunderbolt -- Todd leaps into the
room--
TODD
What are you doing here?!
BEGGAR WOMAN
(clutching at his arm)
Ah, evil is here, sir. The stink of
evil -- from below -- from her! ...

... Beadle dear, Beadle!
He looks anxiously out the window for the Judge:
TODD
Be quiet, woman!
BEGGAR WOMAN
(still clutching at him)
She's the Devil's wife! Oh, beware

now)
Hey, don't I know you, mister?
Todd suddenly sees -- the Judge! -- walking toward the shop--
Todd has no time--!
The music THUNDERS as--
In one brutal motion -- he swings around and grabs his razor -
- fiercely SLASHES her throat -- tosses her in the chair --
pulls the lever -- she slides through the floor--
He pulls the chair back to its normal position just as--
The Judge enters.
JUDGE
Where is she? Where's the girl?
TODD
Below, your Honor. With my neighbor.
Thank heavens the sailor did not
molest her. Thank heavens, too, she
has seen the error of her ways.
JUDGE
She has?
TODD
Oh yes, sir, your lesson was well
learned. She speaks only of you,
longing for forgiveness.
JUDGE
Then she shall have it. She'll be here
soon, you say?
The music builds, the pace increases:

Sit, sir, sit.

You're in a merry mood again today,
barber.
TODD

Pretty women!

What we do for
They sing simultaneously as Todd smoothes bay rum on the
Judge's face and then reaches for his razor:
JUDGE
Pretty women!
Blowing out their candles
Combing out their hair--
Then they leave--
Even when they leave you
And vanish, they somehow
Can still remain
There with you there...
TODD
Pretty women!
Blowing out their candles
Or combing out their hair,
Even when they leave,
They still
Are there,
They're there...
The music builds dangerously as:
JUDGE
How seldom it is one meets a fellow
spirit!
TODD
With fellow tastes -- in women, at
least.
JUDGE
What? What's that?
TODD
The years no doubt have changed me,
sir.

But then, I suppose the face of a
barber -- the face of a prisoner in
the dock -- is not particularly
memorable.
JUDGE
(a horrified realization)
Benjamin Barker!
TODD
BENJAMIN BARKER!
The factory whistle screams a steady, terrible blast as--
Todd brutally SLASHES the Judge's throat--
Severing his jugular--
The spray of blood drenches Todd--
He pulls the lever and sends the body tumbling out of sight
down the chute.
The music continues...
As Todd stands for a long moment, blood dripping from his
face, exalted.
Then he sinks to his knees, overcome.
The music stops.
A long beat of silence.
Then Todd looks at his razor deeply:
TODD
Rest now, my friend,
Rest now forever,
Sleep now the untroubled
Sleep of the angels.
Then silence as he reverently sets the razor on the floor and
looks at it.
We focus on his face.
His quest is completed.
His demons silenced.
The ghosts are gone.

It's done.
He just kneels there. No reason to move. No purpose in life.
Then...
A sound from the chest. A slight thump.
His eyes dart to the chest.
He slowly picks up his razor and moves to the chest. Then
suddenly WRENCHES it open and HAULS out Johanna--
TODD
(darkly)
Come for a shave, have you, lad?
JOHANNA
No -- I...
He tosses her in the chair, throws back his arm, his razor
ready--
TODD
Surely, yes! Everyone needs a good
shave--!
SUDDENLY -- A PIERCING SCREAM ECHOES UP FROM THE CHUTE --
Mrs. Lovett's voice -- screaming to raise the dead--
Todd rivets Johanna, pointing the razor at her, a lethal
warning:
TODD
Forget my face.
He spins and bolts out of the shop, leaving her sitting in
the chair--
114   INT. BAKEHOUSE -- NIGHT                                      114
Mrs. Lovett is standing in horror by the mouth of the chute.
The Judge, still barely alive, clutches at her skirt--
She tries to wrench herself away from his vise-like grip--
MRS. LOVETT

He shoves her toward the oven and leans over to pick up the
Beggar Woman's body--
TODD
What's the matter with you? It's only
a silly old beggar--
Then -- Mrs. Lovett opens the oven doors--
The thundering roar from the oven crashes through the room as
the fiery light slashes across the floor--
Clearly illuminating the face of the Beggar Woman.
A chord of music as Todd realizes who she is. Music continues

TODD
