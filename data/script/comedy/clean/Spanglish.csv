SHOOTING DRAFT
FADE IN:
1   INT. BEDROOM - MEDIUM CLOSE - MALE FORM - LATE AFTERNOON      1
A shape fills the lower portion of the screen. It is a man's
back..... a perfect back... good dark color, slim, muscular.
LATIN MUSIC PLAYS... a song.... if you understood the words
you would hear love confronted and considered in a very
specific way...We are in a Mexico City suburb. The day is
hot; small beads of sweat are seen on the man's back, the
first indication that we are in slow motion..Perfect red
fingernails come into view...and now a woman's hand goes
beautifully to work...part sensual back scratch, part
massage. The hand cups bits of the man's back, a strong thumb
probes his spine, a long finger teases the very top of his
ass in a cute finger-pirouette and then continues down --
and, as the hand rises once more to the top of his back for
another trip down his upper body...
MAIN TITLES BEGIN: Full titles, minute after minute of titles
with some key dissolves helping us to represent some 30
minutes of time passage as the hand continues to scratch and
rub, the man making sounds of pleasure. The hand is getting
tired. Flirtatious no more, this is getting to be work...The
unseen woman shakes the hand vigorously, the man says a
single sound urging her to continue, the exhausted hand
complies, then stops, then the unseen woman changes hands as
TITLES CONTINUE.....The new hand, wearing a wedding ring,
goes to work then it too stops to rest..the man says
something in Spanish...important for us because it will
establish that there will be no subtitles and yet we
understand perfectly that he is asking her to continue. She
replies in Spanish lightheartedly, with a small and pretty
laugh, that her hands are tired. We understand. The man tells
her to continue. She continues, the rub now desultory and
resentful. She stops for another rest. The man wants more and
grabs forcibly at her hand -- his own hand coming into view
for the first time. She says, in Spanish, with no particular
anger, ""you said you would never push me around again. If you
do, I will somehow break your arm so you can rub your own
back as high as you want."" (NOTE: All Spanish dialogue will
be worked hard to provide something extra for the Spanish
speaking..working in tidbits or extra exposition, jokes etc.)
For now, the man's tone changes, placating her to continue.
Even as she resumes the massage they begin to have a domestic
argument in Spanish. This is no longer a massage we envy.
This back rub, going as it does from sex and hope to discord
and alienation, will be our only full direct knowledge of
their marriage.
2   INT./EXT. BEDROOM / DUSTY ROAD - OTHER ANGLE                  2
Showing us the room and beyond, through the window, a school
bus stopping at the corner on a dusty road.
We now see the full figure of the woman's back as she looks
up with excitement and stops rubbing with the word,
2.
""Cristina."" When the man protests her stopping she indicates
they should both run and meet their daughter. He waves her
off. Stunned by his disinterest, she runs from the room.....
3   EXT. DUSTY ROAD - THE BUS                                     3
As CRISTINA, six years old and adorable, waits patiently to
step down. She sees her mother and grins and waves excitedly,
digging into her little pack to pull out an English book
which she displays with pride. Now she steps down from the
bus and, as she walks TOWARD CAMERA, narration begins. The
voice is of a girl eleven years older than the child we see.
NARRATOR
To Princeton University's Director
of Admissions: In considering me
for a scholarship you have asked
for, and have every reason to
expect, an essay from me about
myself. And, as a clever high
school graduate, I of course
realize the subtext of this essay
about who I am and why I want to
enter Princeton, is actually to
make clear to you why you should
have me. I have gotten tips, from
friends who have preceded me to
college, that being a Latina, with
my grades, list of activities and
relative poverty, I am as good as
in if I simply do the dance and
work in a word like
""bipolarization"" every so often.
And while I love dances -- this
dance of self is one I am afraid to
master.
(young girl looks off and
lights up)
I prefer to write about my mother.
4   INT. / EXT. HOUSE - SCHOOL GIRL'S POV - MOM                   4
A drop-dead gorgeous Latin woman in her early 20's. As mother
and daughter move inside, a car pulls up with an ominous man
getting out. He nods in another direction calling our
attention to a police car parked off the street. The woman
does not notice - instead shepherding the child to her
father. The woman makes a big fuss over the text books the
child has..this is one supportive mom..again she is
disbelieving that her husband shows no interest, especially
when the child seems briefly hurt. The woman's husband looks
from the window and sees the ominous man coming. The woman
now does everything humanly possible to distract the child so
she does not see what is transpiring.
NARRATOR
For my mother, that afternoon
eleven years ago was a watershed
not because of my father's

imprisonment but because it was my
first day at school....
5   INT. KITCHEN / HUSBAND'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                5
This room is directly across from the husband's room. The
woman looks up to see her husband open the suitcase to show
the man a huge store of Mont Blanc pens and high-end watches.
The man gives her husband some money..all the time the woman
is chattering to distract the girl. Looking off --the woman
grows wide-eyed as she sees her husband count some money. The
undercover cop begins shouting orders. The woman raises her
voice to cover the argument in the next room which puzzles
her daughter.
NARRATOR
There was never any pretense that
the gorgeous, vital, clever,
temperamental animal that was my
mother ever for a heartbeat
considered having any life of her
own. She ignored all her needs and
was alive only for me. It was
terrific.
(a long beat)
At the time.
ON MOM.
As she watches her daughter chew a cookie. Her daughter
begins to tell about her day, her young mother taking on a
glow we have not yet seen. And all the while she eyes the
action in the next room. Her husband makes a break for the
window. The other man points a gun at the ceiling preparing
to fire a warning shot. The woman moves ever so quickly to a
shelf of her favorite dishes, all the while talking to her
daughter, making much over the kid's new school books. It is
an impressive charade.
FULL SHOT - TAKING IN BOTH ROOMS.
And just as the cop shoots at the ceiling, in perfect timing,
she upsets the dishes, the resulting noise covering the
shot.. The woman asks her daughter what she learned
today..the daughter says she was taught a little English.
Mother is impressed as she watches the cop move her husband
toward the front door where other police await. Her daughter
starts to follow her gaze and she distracts her..brandishing
the Spanish/English book and asking her to say something.
6   INT. / EXT. KITCHEN - ON GIRL.                                6
Standing proudly, smoothing her skirt.
CLOSE UP GIRL.
4.
As she clears her throat and says directly into camera.
GIRL
Hi.
The girl and woman are enormously excited over this word even
though, outside, her life's mate is being loaded into the
back of a police car.(Note: Mexican police DO NOT duck the
perpetrator's head WHEN LOADING THEM IN THE BACK SEAT..they
just allow the concussion.) It seems the mother will save her
child the trauma of her father being carted off; but the
police turn on their siren and the girl turns to see her
father as the car pulls away. The child is stricken. A tear
starts to form in her eye. Her mother acts quickly. We are
about to see powerful emotion reversed by sheer force of
will..the mother leans down, gives three quick kisses - power
pecks - to the girl's cheeks and then an admonition in
Spanish.
MOTHER
Una lágrima...sola una sola...Haz
la mejor possible.
NARRATOR
""One tear..only one...so make it a
good one."" This was my mother's
instruction to me.
ON CHILD.
Baffled by the edict..
ON MOTHER.
Holding up one finger. That's it..one tear..she means it.
ON CHILD..
As she complies..one great tear forming and falling..Her
mother's thumb wipes it away..But now her eyes well with more
tears..her mother gestures she must have strength and
resolve..and so she does..a toss of her pretty little
head...the eyes clear.
7   INT. MOTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     7
As the mother, lying in bed with her daughter loses her own
fight with tears..managing with difficulty to keep her
convulsive sobs silent since her daughter and she are
intertwined like pretzels.

nearing 12 years of age..dancing with her mother and some
other smaller children.. The mother eyes the muscular back of

sex appeal. She is turned on..They talk in Spanish...him
saying something hushed like, ""I have been afraid to talk to

interested in... Before the mom can do anything about it, he
asks Cristina to dance and she readily accepts.
ON CRISTINA..
Satellite virginities falling with alarming speed..the first
time held by a male, the first time held close, the first
sexy (albeit touchingly awkward) gaze from half-closed male
eyes which utterly confuses Cristina. He begins to grind his
hips into his dancing partner.

DEBORAH NORWICH CLASKY, a cool beauty in her mid 30's, sits
dominating this three generation portrait of the Good Life.
She is wearing a straw hat and killer Hawaiian shirt..She is
a perfect dresser; meaning her clothes seem to say she
doesn't care, while every article is a true and gifted find.
She is drinking from a tumbler which is also of the ""don't
hold your breath while you try to find something as terrific""
variety. She is flanked by her mother, EVELYN, 60, who is
drinking from a stemmed glass with two olives and her 14 year
old overweight daughter, BERNICE..who is reading, her
grandmother idly holding her hand..In the immediate area more
rolls of sod wait to be laid.

Spanish and Cristina will not only translate but render her
mother's emotion, sometimes including body language. It is
not only a translation but a reenactment.

No..not a name for the stones..a

FLOR
EngreÌdo.

Oh, no..engreÌdo's going to be

deliver the word.

John gets up and takes a conciliatory step toward Flor so
that now Cristina is in the middle looking up at them as she
translates for John
JOHN
I had no idea it would amount to
that kind of money..I thought ---
sort of tops fifty dollars.
CRISTINA AS FLOR
Fifty dollars is a lot of money..
JOHN
Okay. Right.
He has no idea where to take it from here -- the two females
look as he searches for the right thing to say..

upset. It might not look it but I

money..but maybe I should have
checked before I started the whole
thing."|stage direction||

enough to be helped by some little
apology, I would be a fool to bring
it up..I need to say more no matter
what the result. I need to be
impolite. You leave someone else's
child alone. It's simple, no? It
is too easy for children to feel
contradictions..It encourages
questioning their parents..and that
makes them less safe. Your wife
takes her for rides and changes her
hair..You give her money. Here.."|stage direction||

you are complaining about?"|stage direction||

John..
JOHN
I've got to get out of
here..because you keep talking.

him)
Stay put!
She does. Just before he exits.
DEBORAH
You've got to say something.
JOHN
You are a terrible wife.
He exits.
156   INT. MAID'S ROOM - NIGHT...                              156
Evelyn stands in the doorway with Flor..they are looking at
Cristina and her two friends sleeping together.
EVELYN
I don't think you want to wake her
when you're this upset and the
other kids are right there and...
Flor makes a noise of frustration and retreats from the room.
157   INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT                               157
As they arrive at the interior entrance, John comes down the
stairs just as Flor opens the front door.
JOHN
Where you going?
FLOR
I'm leaving....I have finally..
JOHN
Me too..I'll drive you.
FLOR
No.
JOHN
Yes..come on...it's past midnight
here.
FLOR
If you truly don't know why I say
""no"" let me at last say the reason.
At least that will be a relief.
Have you no idea that I....
104.
Before she can there is the sound of scratching toes on the
floor and a ball comes into lower frame with a dog's
snout..Flor loses her thought and tosses the ball.
OTHER ANGLE.
As Chum, now the only happy creature in the house, fetches it
and returns.
JOHN
Look I have to get out of here
right now..
FLOR
Go..
John exits to driveway...Flor makes one last toss..these
tosses have not made a dent in her anger and frustration.
FLOR (CONT'D)
Goodbye, Chum.
Another toss and Flor follows John out the door.
ON CHUM.
No longer happy. He has lost his only easy mark. He stares at
the closed door..the ball drops from his mouth to the floor.
158   EXT. CLASKY DRIVEWAY - NIGHT...                             158
John is at the car but Flor heads for the gate.
JOHN
(as decisive as we've seen
him)
I'm taking you.
FLOR
(with anger)
Why?!?
JOHN
Because if I don't -- I'll worry
about you and I can't handle that
right now, okay?
Flor emits a crooning sound.
FLOR
Ahhhhh.
(stunned and worried)
I never made that sound over a man
before..
105.
Flor shudders at her own sappiness as John opens the
passenger door for her...very much into his own torture he
nonetheless grabs her arm and guides her up and in..she
catches and appreciates his automatic gracious manners while
he is clearly fucked up...She is impatient with his
solicitousness almost slapping his hands away as he makes
sure her skirt doesn't get crushed in the door..The
frustration roiling in her.
FLOR (CONT'D)
Please!?! Mandilón.
OTHER ANGLE..
Deborah watching them...
HER POV.
Her cuckolded husband closing the door behind her gorgeous,
soon-to-be ex-housekeeper.
CLOSE ON DEBORAH..
She trembles under the force of imminent justice.
159   INT. JOHN'S CAR - LATE NIGHT                                159
Two pissed-off people..jaws set...breathing labored..As the
car starts and Flor looks back, she lets out a guttural and
explosive shout...
FLOR
(a quick and mighty vent)
Arrchhhhhyeeeeiii!
For John, the first clear thing he has heard in a while..
JOHN
Yes! Exactly! Well put! Teach me
that word sometime. I can really
use it.
She nods..there is almost a moment of relaxation..then the
anger fires an immediate need..She leans across the seat to
deliver an urgent message to him. The words come out
exponentially too forcefully.
FLOR
I quit this job!
His spontaneous and forceful reaction surprises her..
JOHN
I quit this job!!!!!

As she leaves the car and goes into a drug store. John, sober

toward an Hispanic market. This could be where it hits him
that he's on a date...If so..it's too late to duck..

As they enter the main restaurant...
FLOR
I've never seen your place. Very
perfect.
He heads for the kitchen.
JOHN
I'm going to cook, Beautiful.
(on a dime correction)
I'm going to cook beautifully.
FLOR
Hey..please..
He turns.
FLOR (CONT'D)
We both were not normal because we
are angry and we act like we are
angry with each other and we are
not..I am not. I am glad to be with
you. It feels comfortable to be
with you. If I just left the job
and never spoke with you it would
have been sin. You understand?
JOHN
Ummmmmmmmm...Yes.
He stands next to her and, for want of a better physical
expression, pats her on her back..She eyes him, almost
critical about the lame extent of his aggression....He can't
quite look at her...He pats her again..
REAR ANGLE..THE PAT ON THE BACK.
The pat is becoming a rub..he cups her back..slides his
hand..she responds just a bit..
JOHN (CONT'D)
I think I'm inventing a horrible
new way of making out..
FLOR
Not so horrible.....
His hand keeps going..he now hugs her to him even though they
both still face front.. like a loving couple on a walk to the
market. His hand squeezes her shoulder.
JOHN
My hand is the only sane part of my
body..every other part wants to
jump off a cliff.

As John starts cooking up a storm...there is some velocity to
his cooking...he still seethes. Then reacts as Spanish Music
starts to play. He clears his throat as if he must make a
