by
Larry Cohen"|unknown|||
1||"FADE IN:
NEW YORK CITY - AERIAL VIEW OF DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - DAY
MULTIPLE STREET SCENES - DAY
The sidewalks crowded as usual.  A sea of humanity.  People
come and go -- always in a hurry.  Oblivious of one another.
A TRAFFIC JAM -- A STREET being torn up by construction
workers; A SANITATION TRUCK loading up refuse; VENDORS
PEDDLING nuts and salted pretzels; PANHANDLERS blocking a
passerby.  Intimidating.  Demanding.  Almost mocking.
We're surrounded by the teeming life of the city as we've
come to expect it -- complete with a cacophony of sound.
MULTIPLE CUTS -- Phone kiosks and phone booths on the East
Side and West Side -- uptown and down.
One frustrated caller has lost his money in the slot and he
takes it out on the equipment -- smashing the receiver
violently against the coin box until the instrument splinters
into a dozen pieces."|stage direction|||
2|NARRATOR|"There are 237,911 pay telephones in
the five burroughs of the city of
New York.  Many of them are still
in working order."|speech|NARRATOR|?|
3||"DOZENS OF QUICK CUTS --
NEW YORKERS on the phone in extreme close up.  We don't hear
the words.  Only the facial expressions inform us that these
are human beings under tremendous pressure.  Life in the city
is wearing them down.
MULTIPLE SHOTS - JUST MOUTHS
Lips jabbering into receivers.  Cross-cut against one
another."|stage direction|||
4|NARRATOR|"Despite increased usage of cellular
devices, an estimated four and a
half million New Yorkers and two
million visitors still utilize pay
telephones on a regular basis.  At
thirty-five cents a pop... for the
first three minutes."|speech|NARRATOR|?|
5||"ANGLE ON CORNER IN MID-MANHATTAN - DAY
There's a phone booth situated on the southeast side of the
street."|stage direction|||
6|NARRATOR|"You're looking at the telephone
booth at the corner of 45th Street
and 8th Avenue in the heart of the
Manhattan theatrical district.  It
has been scheduled to be removed
and replaced by a kiosk.  It's one
of the few remaining phone booths
left in the city."|speech|NARRATOR|?|
7||"CAMERA MOVES IN on the irate caller in the booth -- a very
well-dressed gray-haired lady -- totally conservative in
appearance."|stage direction|||

9|WOMAN IN BOOTH|"You have lied to me for the last
time, you lowlife prick bastard!  I
don't ever want to hear the sound
of your fucking voice again."|speech|WOMAN IN BOOTH|?|
10||(listens)|location|||
11|WOMAN IN BOOTH|Yes, well fuck you, too!|speech|WOMAN IN BOOTH|?|
12||"She slams down the receiver and exits.  The booth remains
vacant for a brief interval."|stage direction|||
13|NARRATOR|"At least three hundred calls daily
originate from this booth.  The
coins are collected twice a day.
This booth has been burglarized
forty-one times in the last six
months."|speech|NARRATOR|?|
14||"Someone is approaching the booth, fishing in his pocket for
coins.  This is STUART SHEPARD, snappily dressed, his hair
styled and his nails manicured.  Here is a man who clearly
takes excellent care of himself.  He sports a Donna Karen
suit and silk Armani tie.
He's about to step into the booth when he's accosted by a
middle-aged man in a soiled apron who's run out of a nearby
restaurant and has finally caught up with him."|stage direction|||
15|MARIO|Stu, we got to talk.|speech|MARIO|M|True
16|STU|"Wish I could accommodate you,
Mario, but this is my busy time of
day."|speech|STU|M|True
17|MARIO|"How come you cross the street every
time you go past the restaurant?"|speech|MARIO|M|True
18|STU|"Why don't I stop in later for some
lunch?"|speech|STU|M|True
19|MARIO|"There's no more drinks or free
meals until the restaurant starts
showing up in the columns like you
said."|speech|MARIO|M|True
20|STU|"I'm doing my level best for you
people."|speech|STU|M|True
21|MARIO|"One lousy mention in the Post and
you expect to eat for six months!"|speech|MARIO|M|True
22|STU|"I got the food critic from the
Village Voice all lined up to give
you a review."|speech|STU|M|True
23|MARIO|"That's what you tell me last July.
And he never shows."|speech|MARIO|M|True
24|STU|"I was allowing you time to expand
the menu.  Wallpaper the bathrooms,
for God sakes.  You get only one
shot with these fucking critics and
I don't want you to blow a rare
opportunity."|speech|STU|M|True
25|MARIO|"You the one blowing it.  How long
you think you can fuck everybody?"|speech|MARIO|M|True
26|STU|"Hold on right there.  I've got a
very excellent reputation around
this town."|speech|STU|M|True
27|MARIO|"So how come you take two nice suits
of clothes from Harry and never get
his daughter on David Letterman?"|speech|MARIO|M|True
28|STU|"Hell, I'm not an agent.  I'm a
publicist."|speech|STU|M|True
29|MARIO|Mister, you're nothing!|speech|MARIO|M|True
30|STU|"Believe me, Valerie's on the
waiting list to audition.  Harry's
got no complaints.  He just let me
pick out this tie the other day."|speech|STU|M|True
31|MARIO|That Harry's a damn fool!|speech|MARIO|M|True
32|STU|"Mario, please let me make this up
to you.  How about I arrange for
the opening night party for this
new off-Broadway show I'm handling
-- to be held at your place with
local TV coverage on nine and
eleven?  I mean I had it promised
to another client -- who actually
pays me money.  But it isn't firmed
up yet.  And I could throw it your
way.  Maybe."|speech|STU|M|True
33|MARIO|What is involved?|speech|MARIO|M|True
34|STU|"You'd toss in the buffet for say
seventy or eighty.  The producers
would supply their own vino, of
course.  I'd deliver you a
truckload of celebrities.  And if
they like the food, they'll all
come back, naturally."|speech|STU|M|True
35|MARIO|What celebrities?|speech|MARIO|M|True
36|STU|"You want Liza Minelli?  An Oscar
winner.  Or Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.?"|speech|STU|M|True
37|MARIO|Is he still alive?|speech|MARIO|M|True
38|STU|"I saw him last night going into the
Four Seasons.  I'll bring you over
a whole VIP list when we come by
for dinner."|speech|STU|M|True
39|MARIO|"How come everybody wants to eat but
nobody wants to pay?"|speech|MARIO|M|True
40|STU|"You can't think small like that.
Hey, you still feature musicians
Fridays and Saturdays?"|speech|STU|M|True
41|MARIO|At least they work for their meals.|speech|MARIO|M|True
42|STU|"What about Harry's daughter as an
extra added attraction?  She'll
belt out five or six showtunes --
two sets a night -- and it won't
cost you a fucking nickel."|speech|STU|M|True
43|MARIO|How come?|speech|MARIO|M|True
44|STU|"Star Showcase!  Let me handle
setting that up.  And when she
eventually goes on Letterman,
she'll announce I'm currently
appearing over at Mario's fine
supper club.  Right over CBS she'll
say that, Mario."|speech|STU|M|True
45|MARIO|"You're full of shit.  You know
that?  All bullshit!"|speech|MARIO|M|True
46|STU|That's just a vulgar word for PR.|speech|STU|M|True
47||"(placing an arm around
him)"|location|||
48|STU|"Mario, you can't hurt my feelings.
Even when I was a kid and they
hurled certain invectives my way,
it never bothered me.  Other kids
would fall apart if anybody called
them a fucking name.  Me, I just
loved the attention!  'Shit-for-
brains' -- that's what the bigger
kids named me.  And I answered to
it.  Hey, 'shit-for brains'
reporting for duty.  Everybody
loved me for that.  I could take
abuse.  After a while, I kind of
wore them down.  There was nothing
more they could say to me.  So they
stopped.  I kind of missed it."|speech|STU|M|True
49|MARIO|I'm sorry I even talked to you.|speech|MARIO|M|True
50|STU|"I'll bet your loving wife put you
up to this.  She saw me pass by and
she sent you out in the street.
But I don't hold it against you
personally -- you still serve up
superior veal chop."|speech|STU|M|True
51||(entering phone booth)|location|||
52|STU|"Now I got urgent business to
conduct, Mario."|speech|STU|M|True
53||"He slides the booth closed in Mario's face.
The frustrated restaurateur glares at him through the glass
before giving up and walking off -- talking to himself as he
goes up the block.
INSIDE THE BOOTH, Stu inserts his thirty-five cents and
dials."|stage direction|||
54|STU|Hello, Mavis, sweet creature.|speech|STU|M|True
55|MAVIS' VOICE|"Where have you been?  Do you think
I have nothing to do but wait
around for you to call?"|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M|True
56|STU|"I'm only a few minutes late,
loveliest individual on earth."|speech|STU|M|True
57|MAVIS' VOICE|"Stu, I'm so lonely.  When can I see
you?"|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M|True
58|STU|"Good news in that arena.  Kelly
goes into rehearsal as of Monday.
You know how dedicated she is.  By
the time she gets back from dancing
her ass off, she goes right to
sleep.  We'll have both our days
and certain nights.  Not to mention
when they take the show on the
road."|speech|STU|M|True
59|MAVIS' VOICE|How long is that for?|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M|True
60|STU|Four to five weeks -- minimum.|speech|STU|M|True
61|MAVIS' VOICE|"Maybe I should quit my job so we
can be together full time."|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M|True
62|STU|I wouldn't do that.|speech|STU|M|True
63|MAVIS' VOICE|"Sometimes I think if I have to give
one more fucking manicure..."|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M|True
64|STU|That's how you met me.|speech|STU|M|True
65|MAVIS' VOICE|"I never saw a worse set of nails.
Bit right down to the quick."|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M|True
66|STU|"I'm much better groomed since
you've been looking after me."|speech|STU|M|True
67|MAVIS' VOICE|I'm glad you admit it.|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M|True
68|STU|"Even Kelly remarked on it when I
first met her."|speech|STU|M|True
69|MAVIS' VOICE|"She could care less how you look.
She's only interested in pushing
her own career.  Some wife you're
stuck with!"|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M|True
70|STU|"The marriage is not without its
compensations.  Do you imagine I
could afford that apartment on what
I'm earning?  Not with everybody
cutting back on the publicity.  Not
to mention a million college
graduates coming into the
profession trying to cut me out.
And one thing you can't expect from
your clients is loyalty.  They get
a couple of bad notices, they dump
you.  Goodbye."|speech|STU|M|True
71|MAVIS' VOICE|Don't go.|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M|True
72|STU|"I wasn't saying goodbye to you.  I
was saying how the clients try to
give you the wave off without even
a month's notice."|speech|STU|M|True
73||"A conservative businessman now stands outside the booth
waiting to use it.  He deliberately glances at his watch a
few times to demonstrate his impatience.  This bothers Stu
who slides the booth open a crack."|stage direction|||

75|STU|"What?  Is your watch busted?  It's
twenty after eleven and I'm gonna
be occupied indefinitely with my
transaction.  So get out of my
face!"|speech|STU|M|True

gentleman who gives up and departs."|stage direction|||
77|STU|"Sorry, honey.  There will be no
further interruption."|speech|STU|M|True
78|MAVIS' VOICE|"Why must you always be calling me
from some booth?"|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M|True
79|STU|"On account of that phone records
are regularly subpoenaed in divorce
proceedings.  And I don't want some
entry showing up on my cellular
bill either.  She gets the mail.
She looks these items over.
Sometimes she even dials up a
strange number to see who it is."|speech|STU|M|True
80|MAVIS' VOICE|Then she suspects something.|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M|True
81|STU|"It's only because her last husband,
the choreographer, ran around on
her.  She can't get that out of her
head.  That's how she caught onto
him.  The phone bills."|speech|STU|M|True
82|MAVIS' VOICE|"She hasn't developed much skill at
holding a man."|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M|True
83|STU|"You know what a self-fulfilling
prophecy is?  She was so sure I was
going to find me a woman that she
finally drove me back to you.  I
thought I'd feel all guilty about
it -- but I guess it hasn't kicked
in yet."|speech|STU|M|True

85|STU|"Still, I wouldn't do anything to
hurt her.  Basically, Kelly's a
decent individual."|speech|STU|M|True

time?"|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M|True
87|STU|"Hurt?  You were glad to be rid of
me."|speech|STU|M|True
88|MAVIS' VOICE|"For a while I was, 'til I took
stock of what was around.  You're
the lesser of many evils."|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M|True
89|STU|"That's about the nicest thing you
ever said."|speech|STU|M|True
90|MAVIS' VOICE|I'll have it engraved.|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M|True
91|STU|"We've been up front with each other
from the beginning.  Let's keep it
that way.  How about a drink?  Say
seven o'clock?  The Monkey Bar?"|speech|STU|M|True
92|MAVIS' VOICE|"Meet me in front.  I don't like
walking in there unescorted."|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M|True
93|STU|"Yeah, you're great enough looking
to be mistaken for one of those
thousand dollar a night girls."|speech|STU|M|True
94|MAVIS' VOICE|It happens all the time lately.|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M|True
95|STU|"And wear that short black number I
bought you from Bendel's."|speech|STU|M|True

that dress you like."|speech|MAVIS' VOICE|M|True
