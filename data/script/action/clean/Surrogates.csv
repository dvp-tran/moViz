RESIDENTIAL BUILDING. The rider, clad in black leather,
climbs off his machine. We'll call him the ASSASSIN.
He flips up his VISOR. His face is scarred, stubbly. He
conceals himself in an alcove, eyes never leaving the
building's entrance.
A uniformed DOORMAN opens the high-rise's lobby door for
a HANDSOME YOUNG MAN in a TUXEDO and TRENCHCOAT.
THE ASSASSIN has been waiting for this. He removes what
looks like a rifle scope from his jacket, aims it at
TUXEDO.

digital readout: ""SCANNING..."" Then a long SERIAL
NUMBER reads out and the name, ""LIONEL ALEXANDER CANTER,""

THE ASSASSIN puts away the scanner scope, satisfied. He
reaches a hand into a pocket, withdraws a mysterious
DEVICE. The size of a first generation cellphone, it has
a military look, with a clear sliding panel over safety
switches and buttons.

A HARD-CORE BAND plays on an elevated stage. The

TUXEDO sits by himself. He raises a GLASS TUBE attached
to a CORD, one of a few leading into an ELECTRONIC DEVICE
