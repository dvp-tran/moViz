in the wind, towards the shore. Winter rain slices the air.
Ahead, the port of Toulon, home of the French navy. A forest
of tall masted warships.
The great ships heave at anchor, the wind whipping their
rigging.
Through the sea spray we see the great ribs of warships
under construction, and warships being refitted.

6||"Storm-lashed sea and driving rain. A great wave rises up
and hammers down. As it recedes we see the figures of men
heaving on great ropes, the sea water streaming down over
their faces. The harsh storm light catches glints of metal:
these men are CONVICTS, chained by manacles, heads shaved,
wearing red shirts with prison numbers crudely stitched
onto them.
Now we see that the ropes run up to a ship that is being
hauled ashore - a storm-damaged man-of-war, its masts
broken, rising and falling on the surge.
As yet another great wave rolls over the convicts, we
follow the straining ropes down into the base of the
slipway, and find the convict JEAN VALJEAN, up to his waist
in water, chained by two sets of manacles, as the rain and
spray and wind scream round him. A great brute of a man, he
seems to feel nothing.

steep steps of the dock wall.
Behind Javert, through the storm rain we glimpse a forest of
half-built ships, their ribbed frames like great skeletons in

FOREGROUND convicts are at work on another ship that is

24||"With a last great heave the lines of convicts haul the
damaged ship onto the slipway.
CRACK! The stern flagpole of the ship snaps in a vicious gust
of wind and crashes down into the shallow water near Valjean.
Javert sees and points his stick at Valjean in silent
command. Valjean stares back for a beat, defying him. Then he
drops down into the seething water and re-emerges with the
great mast in his hands, held over his head. His head breaks
water with his bitter gaze still on Javert, as he throws the
mast ashore in a deliberate display of strength.
Javert nods to the guards, and they begin to form the
chained men into lines to return to their prison. The storm
is passing now, blown by the driving wind.
Javert approaches Jean Valjean."|location

33||"Valjean makes his way up a rising track, a worn knapsack on
his back. He comes to a stop at the top of the hill, and
there before him, lit by the rising sun, spreads a wide
vista of fields and towns and villages, stretching into the
distance, with the snow capped Alps beyond. Behind and
below him lies Toulon at the sea's edge. As we hear the
musical theme ('Freedom is Mine'), we see for the first
time the darkness in his face give way to a new hope.
VALJEAN
Freedom at last -
How strange the taste!
Never forget the years - the waste,
Nor forgive them for what they've
done.
They are the guilty - Everyone!

Passing the uncurtained window of a cottage, he comes to a

heart: a father at a table by lamplight, his young wife
before him, his children on either side. Nothing special,

Valjean lies on the bed, fully dressed, deeply asleep.
Outside a dog barks.
Valjean's eyes snap open. The first thing he sees by the
light of the moon is an image of God the Father gazing down
on him from the painted ceiling. In panic, fearing
judgement, he sits bolt upright. Then he looks round, and
remembers. He gets out of bed, and opens the door.
There, across the narrow passage, the door stands open to
the Bishop's bedroom. In the moonlight, he sees the Bishop
lying asleep. Above his bed, the cupboard where the silver
is kept.
Valjean moves silently into the Bishop's room, holding a
metal miner's spike which he pulls from his bag. The floor
boards creak. He looks down at the old man, holding his
breath, but the bishop is peacefully and innocently asleep.
He reaches up to the cupboard. It is unlocked. The cupboard
door opens with a sharp cracking sound. The Bishop,
disturbed in his sleep, moves a little. At once Valjean is
over him, like a wild animal, spike raised to strike should
he wake. The Bishop sleeps on. The moon comes out and
lights up his beautific, smiling face. Valjean is thrown.
He turns back and opens the cupboard door fully: there is
the silver.

Carefully he picks it out, fearful of every clink. One last
look at the sleeping old man, and he makes a run for the

My life was a war that could
never be won.
They gave me a number and
murdered Valjean
When they chained me and left me
for dead
Just for stealing a mouthful of
bread!
Yet why did I allow this man
To touch my soul and teach me
love?
He treated me like any other
He gave me his trust
He called me brother.
My life he claims for God
above...
Can such things be?
For I had come to hate the world -
This world that always hated me!
Take an eye for an eye!
Turn your heart into stone!

Fauchelevent deeper into the mud that will soon bury him.

himself under the cart at this higher end, and braces
himself to lift it from beneath.

determination.

Tenement by a passing carriage. Once it passes Marius sees
two people in the street outside. One is an old gentleman,
Valjean. The other is a beautiful young girl, Cosette. The
two are giving alms to beggars as they walk back from
evening church service.
Marius can't take his eyes off Cosette. He's never seen
anyone so lovely in his life. We hear the instrumental
foreshadowing of `A Heart Full of Love'.
As if drawn by Marius's gaze, Cosette looks up and meets
his eyes. She too is amazed: he's looking at her as if he
already knows her. A second carriage breaks their held
gaze.
Marius continues on down the street and when he looks back,
at that precise moment Cosette looks at him again.
Valjean instinctively puts his arm round her, guarding her
jealously from this distant boy's gaze.
We cut further down the street to an alleyway where the
Thenardiers, heavily disguised, are waiting for Valjean's
approach with their gang of crooks, Babet, Brujon,
Clacquesous, Montparnasse.

between the backs of tall houses. The alley turns a corner -
and there ahead is a dead end. Behind him, the stamp of
soldiers' boots. Ahead, no way out.
Then his searching gaze falls on an iron grating in the
ground. A storm drain.
ON THE SOLDIERS - As they come round the corner into the
end of the alley. They look round. It's empty.
SOLDIER
Nothing here!
The soldiers depart. A moment of silence.
Then into the alley's end steps Javert. Not so easily
fooled. He walks all the way to the end, and looks round.
He sees the drain at his feet. He sees the signs that the
grating has been lifted.
He stoops, and tries to lift it. It's far too heavy for
him.
He straightens up and looks round, calculating. Where does
the drain lead?"|unknown

pipe, where dark water races. Suddenly they start to slide,
then drop through a vent into a wide sewage tunnel. Faint
light reflecting off the slime of curving tunnel walls. The
skitter of rats. Sodden forms floating by: dead bodies.
Valjean carries Marius down the tunnel, moving as fast as
he can, losing strength all the time. He reaches an
intersection where four sewers meet. Light falls through
distant gratings. One of the four sewers is dry. Here he
lets his burden down, and himself sinks to the slimy ground
to rest. He lets his eyes close.
A voice echoes in the shadows.

A man who only learned to love
When you were in his keeping."|speech

the candles burn in the silver candlesticks. There he sees
three ghosts waiting for him. The ghost of the Bishop. The
ghost of Fantine. And beyond her, watching Marius with
love, the ghost of Eponine.
Fantine comes towards him, reaching out her hands."|location

Cosette embraces Valjean, weeping.
Valjean reaches up his hands, and lets the ghost of Fantine
take them.
FANTINE/EPONINE
Take my hand
I'll lead you to salvation
Take my love
For love is everlasting...
VALJEAN/FANTINE/EPONINE/BISHOP
And remember
The truth that once was spoken:
To love another person
Is to see the face of God...
Led by Fantine, Valjean walks out of the Chapel towards the
cloister.
What remains is Cosette, her head cradled in the lap of the
man who has just died.
The walls of the cloisters are covered in votive candles.
The Bishop of Digne waits in front of the candles. Now
Valjean's strong and young again. Before they reach the
wall of candles, all three are gone.
As they disappear we CRANE UP, high over the cloister, high
over the walls of the Convent and we see the Paris streets
outside. Fires are burning and debris is scattered in the
streets. Dawn is breaking.
From far away, the sound of an approaching crowd -"|unknown

rising sun reveals the devastation left by a bitter street
battle. Past the remains of a barricade.
The distant sound of an approaching march.
SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:
Sixteen years later
Paris, 1848.
From far off, the swelling sounds of the approaching march
become the words of a song.
MARCHERS
Do you hear the people sing
Lost in the valley of the night?
It is the music of a people
Who are climbing to the light
For the wretched of the earth

Bastille. The triumphal column has long been completed, but
the great elephant is sadly dilapidated and has become
incorporated into an immense barricade - three stories
high, seven hundred feet long. Down all the streets that
converge on the square we now see the multiple victory
marches approaching. They cheer and beat drums as they
climb up to the top of the barricade.

there are: thousand upon thousand. And there marching among
them we see ghosts from the past - Enjolras and the
students who died - and Fantine - and Eponine -
And out of the crumbling elephant peers another ghost: the
grinning face of Gavroche. He climbs out to dance on the
elephant, as the crowd fill the square."|location
