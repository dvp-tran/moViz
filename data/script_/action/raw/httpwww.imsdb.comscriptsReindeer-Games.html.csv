where a handful of paper-cut snowflakes have been pasted.
The sounds of YELLING INMATES and GATES slamming shut echo
through the fortress. Rudy watches a spider scurry across
the paper snow. It's his excitement for the day.
He turns to the wall, where there's a photo of his teenage
self with some co-workers at an auto body shop. And a family
photo, cheery Midwesterners, with Rudy a scowling Artful
Dodger.
A WALL CALENDAR
Shows the dates have been crossed off up to December 18th.
December 22nd is circled again and again.
Rudy muses at the calendar, then hops out of his bunk. Drops
to the floor, crosses to a desk, finds a chewed-on pen.
Turning back to the beds we reveal --
THE LOWER BUNK
where Rudy's cellmate, NICK MASON (32), rugged, mustached
and well-built, sleeps soundly. In contrast, his bed-wall is
a COLLAGE OF PHOTOGRAPHS, twenty, maybe thirty of them. Almost
a mural.
All of them photos of A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL, mid-twenties,
smiling out from beaches, parties and snowy scenes. Gorgeous
brown hair, heartbreaking smile. Effortlessly sexy.
RUDY
stares at the pictures for a moment, wistful. Nick snores,
turns over. Rudy climbs atop his bunk again, with the pen
this time. And crosses December 18th off the calendar."|stage direction

Aboard the bus, the seats fill up. Ex-cons are feeling up
their wives, kids are climbing on their absent daddies,

ON SCENE
Rudy crouches behind the pickup, slips around the other side.
Merlin and Jumpy walk right by him.
Rudy criss-crosses through the parking lot, hidden by cars,
heading away from his room's window. His window. Rudy glances
back to see if the truckers notice that, but they don't seem
to. They stand at the Nova, talking.
Rudy shivers, waiting. They're not leaving. When their backs
turn, Rudy dashes twenty feet to the cover of the building.
He slips around the corner, out of sight.
AROUND THE SIDE OF THE HOTEL
Rudy hops through snowdrifts, pressed to the wall, moving
toward a side entry --
-- when he stops, hearing a woman's LAUGHTER.
Above his head are a row of windows. Reflections of rippling
water on the ceiling inside. It's the hotel pool behind this
wall.
Sounds of SPLASHES. Murmured VOICES.

steps further into the trailer, to the back of the Nova.
IN THE CAR
Rudy immediately wriggles his hands, trying to touch his
wrists together. Trying to press together the white cuffs of
his Santa suit. Trying to get the right pressure point --
-- as a BLADE suddenly springs out of the cuff! The
switchblade he'd stolen from the Blazer -- it's lashed to
his right wrist!
Rudy starts sawing his wrist back and forth, cutting through
the Santa belt --
-- his hands at the bottom of the wheel, too low for either
Ashley or Nick to see --
IN THE TRAILER
Ashley is at the hood of the car, LIGHTING her match. Nick
is at the back bumper, ready to push it down the ramp --"|stage direction

with you!"|speech

The belt breaks! Rudy snaps his hands free! But instead of
trying to escape, he reaches under the steering column,
RIPPING its panel away and pulling wires free!
As Ashley tosses her match onto the hood, and FIRE races
over the body of the car, TONGUES racing inside, over the
dash, over the seats, lapping at Rudy --
-- who ducks his head beneath the wheel, frantic to locate
the right leads --
IN THE TRAILER
Ashley jumps out of the way, to the snow. Nick pushes the
flaming car to the trailer's edge --
-- starting on down the ramp, the ravine ahead --
-- and as gravity starts to take the metal bonfire --
IN THE CAR
Rudy sparks two wires together, FLAMES eating at him --"|stage direction

legs between metal and metal!"|stage direction

She grabs her handgun, OPENS FIRE --

-- while the burning Nova COLLIDES with Ashley, throwing her
onto the hood, and sending the tandem inferno speeding off
the ridgetop --
-- arcing slowly as it PLUMMETS into the ravine, a smoking,
blazing shooting star with a woman's figure hanging on.
The shooting star hits Earth and explodes."|stage direction

the snowy night. Two sacks over his shoulder. walking empty
roads and highways. And passing a roadsign that reads ""Sidnaw --
35 Miles.""
He passes rural roads and driveways, and every time he comes
across a mailbox... he puts a stack of cash inside. On the
soundtrack, the STRINGS and RUM-PUM-PUM-PUMS of ""The Little
Drummer Boy"" start to rise --
With snow falling, he passes a new sign: ""Sidnaw -- 27 Miles.""
With the sun rising, a PAIR OF CHILDREN huddle at a window,
seeing the man in the Santa suit at the end of their driveway.
Giving them something from his sack and ambling on.

The Santa Claus sleepwalks straight for the dining room,
finding a dozen RELATIVES, laughing and eating. A table laden
with turkey and stuffing, gravy and cranberry, wassail and
wine.
The relatives stop still. The room goes silent.
The Santa Claus sits down at the head of the table.
Yes, it's Rudy.
Without a word, he stares at the food before him. And takes
a plate. He stacks it with meat and dressing and trimmings,
and sets it in front of him.
And digs in. Stuffing his face in silence.
His Mother and Father return to the dining room, gaping. The
other relatives look likewise.
All staring at Rudy.
Then, while he eats, without another sound...
...the Mother takes her seat at the table...
...and the Father pulls up another chair.
They touch hands privately, and turn back to their plates.
There's a CLANK of silverware, a SCRAPE of china, a CLINK of
glass, and one-by-one, the relatives resume their meals.
CONVERSATION picks up where it left off, SMILES return to
the table, LAUGHTER slowly rises in the room.
There is Mr. Duncan and Mrs. Duncan, Aunt Lisbeth and Uncle
Ray, Aunt Mary and Uncle Pete, toddler Sasha and teenage
Sam, brother Mike and his girlfriend Jill, sister Stacy and
