WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.)
Doug?...
We see DOUG MATTHEWS, 40's, sitting across the table,
staring at his son, Billy. Doug is handsome in that
honest, sincere way. A guy you would call to help you
move a couch. He watches Billy scoop up his hashbrowns
with a frosted pop-tart. Billy catches his Dad's look
and grins with his mouth full. Doug smiles back, then
looks down at his own plate. He has scrambled egg whites
and sliced tomatoes. His smile fades away.
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
Doug?
Doug snaps out of it and looks up at his wife, KELLY
MATTHEWS. She's attractive, with a patient smile."|speech|FADE IN:|?

be fancy, is it? Just some friends and a
wing platter from Costco?"|speech|DOUG|M
5|KELLY|"It's a our 10th anniversary, Doug. Its
going to be a nice party with nice food
and nice music. And wings have carbs, so
you can't eat them anyway."|speech|KELLY|M

Billy, now pouring lucky charms into a bowl, looks up."|speech|DOUG|M

(MOUTH FULL)"|"The battery ith gone in that thing. You
took them out for the TV clicker.
Doug gives Billy a look."|speech|BILLY|M
16|DOUG|"I did do that. I forgot about that. I
need to get some batteries in there.
Because dentists do have emergencies. We
are doctors, you know? We take the same
oath. The oath of saving lives.
Doug goes to take some of Billy's discarded Lucky Charms.
Billy swats his hand away."|speech|DOUG|M
17|"BILLY

backwards. Billy's friends laugh a little. Doug
notices."|speech|DOUG|M
126|DOUG (CONT'D)|"Well, that's not really my shot. I

Doug swivels, jumps up and releases the ball. It heads
towards the basket, then falls down five feet before it.
It looks more like a pass than a shot. Billy hangs his
head, humiliated."|speech|DOUG|M
