2|1    EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY|"Cars are at a standstill. It's a horrific traffic jam.
Morning rush hour. Sun beating down, asphalt shimmering in the
heat. The blown-out downtown L.A. skyline hovers in the
distance.
We DRIFT past more CARS. Hear one snippet of audio after
another...
One driver taps his steering wheel to PROG ROCK. Another
sings to OPERA. A third raps along to a HIP-HOP track. We
move from a RADIO INTERVIEW to a FRENCH BALLAD to TECHNO,
until finally we begin to hear...
...a new, original piece of music... [ANOTHER DAY OF SUN]
We settle on the CAR from which this new tune is playing.
The driver is a YOUNG WOMAN. She hums along to the riff on
her radio -- then starts SINGING.
Then -- she EXITS her car. Then -- she starts MOVING down the
lane.
One by one, more DRIVERS join her -- SINGING and DANCING
along. Without a single cut, we've found ourselves in a FULL-
FLEDGED MUSICAL NUMBER...
Drivers leap on car-tops, dance Jerome Robbins-style, making
use of the road and the hot gleam of the automobiles. Arms
swaying, feet banging, dancers darting, as the MUSIC blasts.
We WEAVE and SWIRL and DART between and around the cars,
taking the magic in...
Finally -- all the drivers swing back into their vehicles --
and the song comes to a dramatic stop.

She hands the coffee to the Customer. We follow the Customer

don't see the Woman's face, but we see all the eyes in the

another, discreetly pointing as the WOMAN passes by...
WOMAN
Cappuccino, please.
Mia nods. Gets it made. The Manager takes it from her.
MANAGER
On us.
WOMAN
No, I insist.
She pays. Then smiles at Mia and drops a bill in the tip jar.
Mia watches as the Woman walks off, is joined by a STUDIO
EMPLOYEE on a golf cart outside -- we realize this coffee shop
is on a STUDIO LOT -- and is driven away...

""IGNORE"" and the time pops up on the phone's screen: 4:07.

Her nerves are practically visible. As she talks, we PULL
BACK -- to see that she's auditioning for a CASTING DIRECTOR.
MIA (CONT'D)
No, no, Turner's fine. So you -- are you
waiting `til Denver to tell her...?
(as her smile contracts)
Oh. I see...

No, you're right. I understand.

Mia, waving to the Casting Director: Yoohoo. Can I come in?

No, I'm happy for you... I -- I just --

One second.
Mia stops. The Casting Director waves the Assistant in. The
Assistant scurries in, shows her boss a post-it. Mia stands
there, trying to hold onto the tears, hold onto the emotion, as
the Casting Director reads the post-it and thinks.
CASTING DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
...I'll call her back. Tell her I'm almost
done in here.
The Assistant nods. Walks out. Mia waits, trying to maintain...

Old movie posters hang on the walls, including a big Ingrid

trinkets: an old globe, an old blue-and-red suitcase. Mia
takes off her shoe. A blister on her sole."|unknown

The mirror is fogged up. She turns off the vent. The mist on
the glass thickens. She dabs some of it away. Dims the
lights. Looks...
With the fog in place, her reflection looks like one of those
soft-focus old Hollywood close-ups. She hums as she brushes
her hair...
Then -- the door SWINGS open -- and the spell is broken.
TRACY

Mia snaps out of it. Turns. Fog is enveloping TRACY, 27.

then, as the movie's credits start up, Sebastian spots, out of
the corner of his eye, a figure in the aisle...
He looks. The figure turns. Looks at him. It's Mia.
And, caught like a freeze-frame in the projector   light, her
green dress incandescent, the giant movie screen   behind her
like a great piece of back-projection, she looks   more beautiful
than ever right now. A true old-fashioned screen   siren.

Inch by inch, their bodies grow closer. Hands approaching,
breaths quickening, hearts pounding...

And then, suddenly -- just as James Dean and Natalie Wood
arrive at Griffith Observatory, and Mia and Sebastian seem
about to kiss --

their spirits likewise soar -- JOYOUS, EXUBERANT -- until,
finally...

Mia and Sebastian drift back to the floor like feathers. They
land on a pair of seats.
There, once again seated like audience members at a movie, they
turn and look into each other's eyes. The music picks back up
for the big finish, as the lovers lean in and -- in true movie-
movie old-Hollywood big-musical fashion --
-- LOCK LIPS.
It's their first kiss, and it's a kiss to remember -- full of

worried. Closes his eyes, breathes out. We MOVE CLOSE on him.
He breathes in and out again...
He opens his eyes. 8:10. The door's still closed. Resigned,
he starts his car up, BEGINS TO PULL AWAY, when --

paint a portrait of all the dreamers in the world -- all the
