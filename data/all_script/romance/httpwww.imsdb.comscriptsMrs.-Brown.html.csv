Something wipes frame and we are suddenly hurtling through
a forest on the shoulders of a wild-eyed, kilted JOHN
BROWN.  Drenched hair streaming, head swivelling left and
right, as he searches the lightening-dark.  A crack to his
left.  He spins round, raises his pistol, smacks past
saplings and plunges on."|stage direction

4||"Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree and heaves for
air.  A face in its fifties, mad-fierce eyes, handsome,
bruised lips, liverish.  He goes on searching the dark.
Stops.  Listens through the rain.  A beat.  Thinking he
hears a faint thump in the distance, he swings round and
races on."|stage direction

6||"BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's
length, breath coming harder and harder.  But even now
there's a ghost grace, a born hunter's grace.  He leaps
fallen branches, swerves through turns in the path, eyes
forward, never stumbling once."|stage direction

8||"BROWN bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and
stops.  With his pistol raised, he turns one full slow
circle.  His eyes take in every swerve and kick of the
wildly swaying trees.
There's a crack and a branch snaps behind him.  He spins
round, bellows deep from his heart:"|stage direction
9|BROWN|God save the Queen!!|speech
10||"And fires.
Nothing happens.  The trees go on swaying, the storm goes
on screaming and BROWN just stands there, staring into
empty space.  A pause.
Slowly, he starts to frown as the fact begins to dawn on
him that he is alone.  He stares at the thrashing trees,
waving their mocking arms at him.  His hand lets the pistol
drop to his side.  He feels the rain drench down his face.
And now, for the first time, we see that his socks have
fallen to his ankles and his knees are cut to shreds.  He
shifts a foot.  His dress-shoes are covered in mud.  He
goes on staring into the dark.  Nothing.
Just the wind and rain.  Gradually, we pull back, higher
and higher.  As we do, we hear the quiet cultivated voice:"|stage direction
