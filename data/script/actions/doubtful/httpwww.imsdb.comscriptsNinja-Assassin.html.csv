Written by
Matthew Sand & J. Michael Straczynski
REVISED 2nd DRAFT   6/4/08
FADE IN:
CLOSE ON a Horimono Tattoo as it is being drawn into
flesh. The ink is needled into the surface of the skin,
raw and bloody, the needled brush tapped with the
precision of ritual.
The tattoo is in the style of a Kuniyoshi print: Miyamoto
Musashi thrusting his spear into the writhing dragon.
The image has beauty but retains the violence required to
saturate flesh with art.
The skin canvas shifts uncomfortably with the needle-
work.
HOLLYWOOD
Fuck!   Fucking-shit-fuck-fucking-
fuck!
PULL BACK to reveal that we're in...
1   INT. TATTOO PARLOR - NIGHT                                      1
A place of designer furniture, beautiful girls carrying
towels, tea and cigarettes. Dozens of Yakuza look on as
the process continues, sleeves rolled up or shirts off to
expose the lavish tattoos that cover their torsos.
HOLLYWOOD, the young Yakuza member, is getting his first
tattoo, a relatively small one on his back.
He grabs a bottle of sake and suckles it like a baby.
HOLLYWOOD
Watch it, old man!
The old tattoo artist continues tapping his brush.       Maybe
a little harder.
HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)
What the fuck?     You're doing it
wrong.
TATTOO ARTIST
The needle is doing what the
needle does.
HOLLYWOOD
What's that supposed to mean?

TATTOO MASTER
The irezumi does not hide the
skin, the tattoo reveals the
nature of the man and illuminates
the four noble professions in the
Book of Five Rings: the Warrior,
the Artist, the Merchant, and the
farmer. If there is a conflict
between the needle and the skin,
between the mark and the man, then
perhaps the path you have chosen
is not the path for which you are
suited.
HOLLYWOOD
What did you just say, old man?
Hollywood whips his gun out and jams it under the old
man's jaw.
HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)
I know you didn't just disrespect
me, did you? You that fucking
stupid? You disrespect me, and
I'll tattoo this ceiling with your
fucking brains!
The old man speaks with a kind of deference honed through
years of service to men like Hollywood.
TATTOO MASTER
No disrespect.
Hollywood smiles.
HOLLYWOOD
You're lucky. I can't kill you
'til you finish this thing. Gimme
that mirror! How's it looking?
Goons and girls all cluck their tongues in chorus.
Hollywood peers at the new tat through the mirror.         He
whistles approval as Yakuza One enters carrying an
origami envelope.
HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)
Not bad. Not bad. For an old fuck.
YAKUZA ONE
Hey, boss. This just came for you.
HOLLYWOOD
What is it?

YAKUZA ONE
A letter.
HOLLYWOOD
So open it, dumb ass.
He opens the origami envelope, then hesitates at what he
sees.
HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)
What?   What is it?
He pours the contents out into his hand.
YAKUZA ONE
Looks like sand.
He tastes it.
YAKUZA ONE (CONT'D)
Yup. Sand. Black Sand.
The tattoo master drops his brush.     It clatters to the
floor.
TATTOO MASTER
No...
HOLLYWOOD
You know what this is?
The artist barely nods.
HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)
Wanna let us in on the joke?
TATTOO MASTER
Years ago, I watched a man open an
envelope like that one.
His eyes pool with fury at the memory.
TATTOO MASTER (CONT'D)
There were many with him and they
laughed like you laugh now. Then
it came from the shadows and their
laughter was drowned in blood.
You cannot bargain with what is
coming. You cannot reason with it.
Because it is not a human being.
It is a demon sent straight from
hell that will never stop until
you are dead.

HOLLYWOOD
What came out of the shadows?
TATTOO MASTER
I cannot say the word.
HOLLYWOOD
What word?
He pulls open his robe, revealing a hauntingly beautiful
tattoo of a Shinobi demon thrusting its blade into a lump
of scar tissue at the center of his heart.
TATTOO ARTIST
That night, one of their blades
struck here. I should have died,
but for an accident of birth. My
heart is here, on the other side.
Hollywood peers closer at the dark figure of the demon.
HOLLYWOOD
What the fuck is that?
YAKUZA ONE
Looks like a Ninja, boss.
HOLLYWOOD
A ninja? Are you kidding me?
That's the word you're afraid to
say? Ninja?
As he starts to laugh.
HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)
Ninja-Ninja-Ninja!
His laughter is infectious.
HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)
You old fuck! You had me going!
Ninja. That's some good shit.
His Lieutenant laughs hard with him until the top of his
head disappears, sliced off from his jaw up, leaving his
tongue wagging in space.
Lights shatter around the room.
Chaos ensues. The panicked screams of the fleeing
entourage co-mingle in chorus with gruesome death rattles
of Hollywood's foot soldiers as one by one, they are
eviscerated.

There's a RUSH of movement, more felt than seen. The
whistle of swords through the air. Cries and screams.
Guns that fire suddenly and are just as suddenly stilled.
STAY on the face of the Tattoo Master, barely visible in
the thin trace of moonlight from a nearby window.
Frozen. Immobile. As the killing continues around him.
Then: silence, broken by the sound of heavy, desperate
BREATHING, and a MATCH being struck by Hollywood who
looks up --
-- and sees a dark figures standing before him. Everyone
else is dead. Only he and the Tattoo Master remain. The
figure regards him with still silence. For perhaps the
first time in his life, Hollywood is terrified.
HOLLYWOOD (CONT'D)
Listen... you don't have to do
this! Whatever you're getting
paid, I'll triple it! You hear me!
I'll pay you whatever you want!
Just name your price!
Their answer is silence. Hollywood sees his guns nearby.
With a desperate scream, he THROWS the match in the air
as he DIVES for his guns, grabbing one in each hand.
There is a whistle of metal and suddenly his severed
hands are tumbling gracefully through the air.
The blade swings again, slicing through his body as if it
were barely there, coming out the other side as --
-- Hollywood's body erupts as it falls in two pieces,
splattering the artist with blood.
The match touches the floor and goes out.
The Tattoo Master does not move, has not moved.    Frozen.
TATTOO ARTIST
But you are real, aren't you?
After a moment, the ninja emerges into the moonlight, the
way a shadow coalesces into a panther gliding from the
dark to inspect its kill.
The artist doesn't move, but his eyes widen, his heart
pounding in his ears.
TATTOO ARTIST (CONT'D)
For fifty-seven-years, I've told
your story...

TATTOO ARTIST (CONT'D)
No one ever believed
me.
The ninja walks towards him, his steps soundless. He
crouches down, his eyes taking in the old man's tattoo.
TATTOO ARTIST (CONT'D)
But you are real, aren't you?
There's the shing of a sword being unsheathed.    The
artist closes his eyes, anticipating death.
Silence. He waits for the death blow. It does not come.
He finally forces himself to open his eyes.
The ninja is gone, having departed as silently as he
came, leaving death and blood in his wake.
CUT TO:
2   INT. ISTANBUL SUPERMARKET AISLE - DAY                      2
A roll of toilet paper drops into a cart. PULL BACK to
REVEAL RAIZO, 20s, slim and sinewy, his expression
distant, almost haunted. He considers the toothpaste
options for a moment, then drops in one of those too.
Moves on to food.
Turkish Muzak plays in the background, a Beatles song,
""Helter Skelter"" by way of Turkish musicians. Other
SHOPPERS cruise past in their own private quests.
Raizo gets quick, easy bachelor food: six eggs, a single
stick of butter, several handfuls of noodle packages.
3   INT. ISTANBUL SUPERMARKET - CHECK-OUT - MOMENTS LATER      3
Raizo waits while the CHECKER - a pretty young woman -
tallies up his groceries.
CHECKER
That's a lot of noodles.
(beat)
Are you a student? Tourist?   Here
on business?
Raizo shakes his head to all three.
CHECKER (CONT'D)
When was the last time someone
cooked you a real meal?

I get off at seven.

a proper dinner!
She winks at him.       Very cute.
RAIZO
I don't think so. Sorry.
No smile. No emotion in Raizo's face. He pays in cash.
He picks up the bag and starts away when --
CHECKER
So if you're not a student, and
you're not a tourist, and you're
not here to work... what are you
doing?
RAIZO
Waiting.
CHECKER
For what?
RAIZO
For the wheel to turn.
And he exits.
4   EXT. ISTANBUL, STREET - DAY                                  4
Ancient gateway between Asia and Europe. Minarets thrust
up from the tangled streets into the bright Aegean sky.
The street is crowded with bicycles, cars and motorcycles
as Raizo makes his way down a narrow sidewalk.
OZUNU (V.O.)
Wherever you are, wherever you may
go....
5   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE - NIGHT               5
We're in a heavily shadowed room, lit with flickering
candles as an older man, OZUNU -- hard-edged and
unforgiving -- talks to his clan.
OZUNU
...you must never, ever forget who
you are, how you came to be. You
are Ozunu. You are a part of me

7   INT. ISTANBUL RAIZO'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS               7
He stands on the other side of the door, surveying the
room for a moment with severe, unforgiving eyes. The
place is monastic, nothing decorative, or comfortable.
Then, in a quick series of cuts, he checks all of the
secret places he hides things.
A drawer is flipped over and a hidden bottom opens
revealing weapons. A panel in the oven reveals his chain
and blade. A hidden compartment in his suitcase exposes
inky folds of fabric. He sifts through them as we hear-
OZUNU (V.O.)
You should have died.
8   FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE DOJO - DAY                      8
Raizo, breathing hard, stands over another young boy that
he has just defeated in a fight. Both are sweaty, dirty,
scarred. The other children are lined up in perfect
rows, watching silently. Most are boys, but a few are
girls. One of them is KIRIKO, lithe and supple, a
child's eyes haunted by an adult's sorrows and knowledge.
Ozunu circles Raizo as he regards his fallen opponent.
OZUNU
On the street. Abandoned by your
parents. Without a home. Without
people to care for you. You
should have done as most children
do, and gone quietly from this
world, to the next.
(beat)
But, instead you fought. As you
did here today. You fought. And
you won.
As we TRACK with Ozunu, we see that Raizo's body is
covered in scars.
OZUNU (CONT'D)
Scars are the calligraphy of
violence, Raizo. They inscribe
the story of one's life.

Look, no one's denying the

whole idea just doesn't fit in
with a modern world. It's like
one of those questions on an IQ

ninjas.
MIKA
They're real Ryan. You can call
them spooks, or assassins, or
whatever you want if it makes you
feel better, but they're out

nobody is doing a damn thing to
stop them.

Images of the orphanage, of the children training and

There is a scroll that she unrolls revealing the lineage

Also in the box is a single VHS tape.
She pushes the tape into the player.
It's a recording of a surveillance camera staring at the
front of the Sabatin house.
A man walks up to the house and rings's the bell. We
cannot see his face. Sabatin opens the door. They
exchange words. Sabatin seems wary but invites the man
in.
Mika doesn't understand why this is significant.
She hits fast forward until she sees a flash as the man
exits. She stops, rewinds and plays it again.                   *
As he steps out of the shadow of the house, she sees his
face-
It is Raizo.
She is startled when someone pounds on the door. It

A reinforced military Humvee crashes through the cloud of
splintering timber with a roar and an explosion of
blinding lights.
The Ozunu Clan scatters as the massive vehicle heaves
into the courtyard, revealing behind it still more
vehicles, all equipped with brilliant lights.

the shadows are gone. There's no place for the ninjas to
hide anymore. We FIND Mika and Maslow in one of the lead

over Raizo's helpless form.
Maslow takes aim with his submachine gun and squeezes off
a long burst.
Takeshi blocks some of the slugs with his sword and
