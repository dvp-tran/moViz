6||"MOVE THROUGH the doorway to reveal a master bedroom furnish-
ed with exquisite simplicity, revelatory of its sleeping
occupant, WILLIAM PARRISH, 64, a warm but commanding face, a
man of maturity yet who exudes a glow of enthusiasm.
Although asleep, there is an uncommon restlessness to him.
Parrish grips his upper arm as if in pain.  Now the severity
of the pain wakes him, he squeezes his arm.  The wind comes
up, through the wind a VOICE is heard distantly, or is it the
wind itself:"|stage direction
7|VOICE (V.O.)|... Yes.|speech
8||"Parrish blinks, has he heard something, has he not, he is
not sure, he releases his arm, his grimace of pain fades,
the discomfort seems momentarily to have subsided.
He rises now, crosses to the bathroom.  As he pees, a breeze
outside the window, the wind again, but then the Voice comes
up:"|stage direction
9|VOICE (V.O.)|Yes...|speech
10||"It is unmistakably a Voice, it is not the wind, Parrish has
heard something, he looks around, but no one is there.  He
can't finish peeing, turns back to his bedroom.  All beweild-
ered, Parrish looks around once more, climbs back into bed,
trying to trace the source of what he has heard or hasn't
heard; he is not sure.
He pulls the covers up now, not a SOUND, tries to close his
eyes."|stage direction
11|VOICE (V.O.)|Yes.|speech
12||"Parrish sits up again, frightened, but still there is no one
there, he seems fraught with indecision, should he get up,
should he not, what is happening?  He looks out: absolute
stillness and silence, CRICKETS chirp down by the river, a
light FLICKERS from a shadboat, Parrish closes his eyes but
then they flutter open, he glances up at the ceiling and
finally, exhausted, falls back asleep."|stage direction

14||"The great lawn infested with workmen, planting stakes, un-
rolling a huge canvas tent, gardeners fashioning topiary and

older daughter, foremen competing for her attention and she
relishing every moment.
A Painter approaches."|stage direction

dance twenties."|speech
22||EXT. GREAT HALL, COUNTRY ESTATE - MORNING|location
23||"Parrish, groomed for the day, trots down the stairs, observ-

watch, strides down the hall, encounters MAY, 50, a family
retainer who is opening the doors to the terrace as Parrish
passes."|stage direction

34|ALLISON|"Fireworks.  Update -- we're con-
structing the number '65' on the
barge, archers from the State
College at New Paltz will shoot
flaming arrows at it, when it
catches fire it will give us the
effect of a Viking funeral with none

Authority says, for you, they'll
make a special dispensation - of
course there'll be an overtime bill
for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept..."|speech

of them Quince and Susan opposite each other in single seats.
Just as Drew removes color-coded folders from his attache
case and spreads them out for Parrish on his tray table, the
pilot waves to Drew, indicating 'phone call'.  Drew gets up
and heads for the cockpit, Parrish scans the folders, glances
over at Susan who is making some notes on a file of her own.
He motions to her to please come sit beside him, she checks
that Drew is still busy in the cockpit, tucks her papers into
her carryall, and crosses over to Parrish who folds away the
work that Drew set before him into his tray table, locks it."|stage direction

will ever be good enough for me."|speech
134|PARRISH|Well, I wasn't going to say that --|speech
135|SUSAN|What were you going to say?|speech
136|PARRISH|"Listen, I'm crazy about the guy --
He's smart, he's aggressive, he
could carry Parrish Communications
into the 21st century and me along
with it."|speech
137|SUSAN|So what's wrong with that?|speech
138|PARRISH|"That's for me.  I'm talking about
you.  It's not so much what you say
about Drew, it's what you don't say."|speech
139|SUSAN|You're not listening --|speech
140|PARRISH|"Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of
excitement, not a whisper of a
thrill, this relationship has all
the passion of a pair of titmice."|speech
141|SUSAN|Don't get dirty, Dad --|speech
142|PARRISH|"Well, it worries me.  I want you
to get swept away.  I want you to
levitate.  I want you to sing with
rapture and dance like a dervish."|speech

144|PARRISH|"Be deliriously happy.  Or at least
leave yourself open to be."|speech
145|SUSAN|"'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going
to do my upmost --"|speech
146||He smiles.|stage direction
147|PARRISH|"I know it's a cornball thing but
love is passion, obsession, someone
you can't live without.  If you
don't start with that, what are you
going to end up with?  I say fall
head over heels.  Find someone you
can love like crazy and who'll love
you the same way back.  And how do
you find him?  Forget your head and
listen to your heart.  I'm not
hearing any heart."|speech
148||(a moment)|location
149|PARRISH|"Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll
come back.  Because, the truth is
there is no sense living your life
without this.  To make the journey
and not fall deeply in love -- well,
you haven't lived a life at all.
You have to try.  Because if you
haven't tried, you haven't lived."|speech
150|SUSAN|Bravo.|speech
151|PARRISH|Aw, you're tough.|speech

156|SUSAN|"I won't.  And when I tell Drew about
it, he won't either."|speech

did, he'd clock it and punch it into
his laptop in order to pull out some
key phrases when he gives the
Commencement Speech at Wharton."|speech
158|SUSAN|You're terrible.|speech
159|PARRISH|"I know.  But I'm the only father
you've got."|speech

Susan has squeezed into a seat in the corner.  A counterman,
with a smile and a greeting, places a cup of coffee in front
of her.  A sense this is a daily ritual, arming herself for

flinches with a spasm of pain in his shoulder.  It is sharp
but brief, he notices it but what it does not continue, he
ignores it.
Parrish resumes looking at the folder when suddenly the
pain comes again.  He reaches for his shoulder, tries to
massage the pain, it does not subside.  Parrish stands,

clutches at his shoulder and arm, the pain has violently

But it did get me to thinking.  I
started in this business because
this is what I wanted to do.  I knew
I wasn't going to write the Great
American Novel, but I also knew
there was more to life than buying
something for a dollar and selling
it for two.  I wanted to give the
news to the world, and I wanted to
give it unvarnished.  The more we
all know about each other, the
greater the chance we will survive.
Sure, I want to make a profit, you
can't exist without one but John
Bontecou is all profit.  If we give
him license to absorb Parrish
Communications, and he has his eye
on a few others after us, we'll be
appointing him to the position he
craves -- Gatekeeper.  In order to
reach the world you will have to go
through John Bontecou.  And not only
will you have to pay him to do this,
far more expensive, you'll have to
agree with him.  Reporting the news
is a privilege and a responsibility
and it is not exploitable.  Parrish
Communications has earned this priv-
ilege, John Bontecou wants to buy
it.  As your chairman, I urge you to
agree this company is not for sale."|speech

table as I am to be meeting without
Bill, but I got a call last night
from John Bontecou.  Not only is he
still interested, he is sweetening
his offer."|speech
1489||(a moment)|location
1490|DREW|"Although it pains me to say it, in
my opinion Bill Parrish dealt with
us peremptorily in dismissing any
deal with Bontecou.  Therefore, I'm
sorry to say that if we are to exam-
ine this new offer responsibly as
the Board of Directors of Parrish
Communications, we must do so with-
out its Chairman."|speech
1491||(another moment)|location
1492|DREW|"Oh yes, there is one additional
element: Bontecou is so anxious to
get us, he said he'd take Parrish
Communications with our Chairman or
without."|speech

fidgets.  Drew milks the moment."|stage direction
1494|DREW (cont'D)|"It's no surprise if I suggest to you
that the Bill Parrish we know is not
the Bill Parrish you saw yesterday.
You heard that speech -- some strange
emotional rationale to buttress a
knee-jerk rejection of a legitimate
offer.  Does it not strike you that
something is possibly affecting this
man's judgement?  More specifically
-- his judgement to make a critical
business decision?"|speech
1495||Silence, the Board clocking Drew's argument.|stage direction
1496|DREW (cont'D)|"It's not pleasant to say the follow-
ing, but I would be remiss, in this
crisis, if I did not.  When we pre-
sent Bill with the improved Bontecou
offer, and if he refuses to let us
consider it -- once more makes an
adamant or emotional rejection -- we
will have no choice but to seek an
alternative."|speech

-- Bill Parrish, crisis -- his com-
pany, crisis for us.  I came about
with the arrival on the scene of --
Mr. Joe Black.  Mr. Joe who?  Joe
Black.  He attends our Board meet-
int, he sleeps at Bill's house, re-
sides in his office.  Never leaves
his side.  And, in my opinion, is
always in his ear.  Telling him what
to do and Bill is listening.  Who is
Joe Black?  What is his relationship
to Bill Parrish?  And most important,
what is behind his influence on our
Chairman?"|speech

much, Drew.  He's had advisors be-
fore.  Nobody tells Bill what to do."|speech

What we're trying to do here is
gather our thoughts -- in light of
Bill's rejection of Bontecou's offer
-- and make an appropriate presenta-
tion to him as to how we think the
company might proceed.  Won't you
share with our Board the information
you gave me last night?"|speech

He nods confidently to Drew, then turns importantly to the
Board."|stage direction

good news.  As I was telling Drew,
I've been making a little hay while
the Bontecou sun was shining -- two,
possibly three new and boiling hot
prospects for merger."|speech

you've developed?"|speech

1812||"She gets up, closes the door, sits back down again next to
Joe.  A warm, awkward silence, they move closer to each
other, now they fall into a foreplay which Susan recognizes
as such, Joe, on the other hand, participates hungrily but
has no knowledge where it is leading.  His movements are
instinctive, the smell of her hair, the shape of her fin-
gers, odd things about her seem to interest him.  This
excites her because she senses his untutoredness and the
very sense of that stirs her, their reactions to each other
are intuitive and spontaneous; even though Joe has no know-
ledge of how to make love to a woman, ironically his actions
are such that they never beg the question -- has he done it
before.
Strange territory for Joe, not to be 'in control' and exert-
ing his power, but his inventions and responses in lovemak-
ing are so real that an emotional exchange between he and
Susan builds.  Joe has found himself in an unexplored land
of feeling and passion, he loves what is happening and yet
at the same time, is terrified by it.  He feels himself being
lured by some power he has not only never been aware of, but
is deeply dangerous to partake of; he knows what he is doing
is putting who he is at great risk, yet he goes right on.
The powerful contradiction is transmitted to Susan, and in
the end there is the knowledge they have together made a
journey, they both have been swept away in a stream of events
they have created; and they don't care about the consequences.
Spent, they lie in silence.  Finally Susan speaks:"|stage direction

you.  It's like making love to some-
one who has never made love before."|speech

kinds and degrees of deception in my
time, but Bill Parrish has been on
the receiving end of machinations so
Machiavellian that it has rarely
been my experience to encounter.  And
yet he has combatted them stoically,
and selflessly, without revealing my
identity.  Had he violated the vow
of secrecy he took, his task would
have been far easier, he could have
turned defeat into victory, but he
is too honorable a man to have done
that.  And now I must release him
from that vow.  Because of me, he
has lost his work, his company, his
reputation -- and now he's going to

from the party, up a meadow that leads to a hill overlooking
the river.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Down below, the party guests' faces are lit by the initial
fireworks display.  Among them is Susan, but her interest
isn't there.  Not something pulls her attention, an over-
powering feeling that compels her to turn and see, at a
distance, Parrish and Joe walking away up the meadow.  Some-
thing about the sight saddens and at the same time frightens
her, she turns back to the party, dazed, tracing on the
fireworks.

out again, Joe right with him.  In tandem they continue
on and disappear over the crest of the hill.  A barrage
of fireworks lights up the sky.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Down below, Susan, in a pained reflex, again turns and looks
up towards the hill.  There is nobody there.  She hesitates,
now glides away from the party, her step quickens as she
walks up towards the hill.
Susan halts, in the distance a figure is approaching from
over the crest of the hill where Joe and Parrish disappeared.
He is heading straight for her, she tries to make him out,
seems to recognize him, starts to walk towards him as if
pulled by a magnet.  Now she stops again.  It is a man, he
keeps coming, and now that he is close and recognizes him."|stage direction
2474|SUSAN|Joe...?|speech

thing here."|speech
2491||"Susan blinks, a long silence, she touches the sleeve of his
jacket, now her hand traces the outline of his face, she
regards him intently and the dilemma she has been struggling
with the last moments fades away.
Susan slowly realizes this is the Young Man. She is shaken,
a sudden intake of breath."|stage direction
