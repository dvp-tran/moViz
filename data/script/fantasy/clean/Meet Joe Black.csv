FARTHER TO REVEAL an expanse of river, up the bank to
massive lawn running up to a great, classic Hudson River
manor house; the country estate of William Parrish."|stage direction||
3||INT. PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - 4:00 AM|location||
4||"MOVE THROUGH French doors that lead from a wide terrace into
an expansive living room, DOWN wide corridors lined with
Bierstadt and Cole paintings, the Hudson River School, mists

5||INT. PARRISH BEDROOM - 4:00 AM|location||
6||"MOVE THROUGH the doorway to reveal a master bedroom furnish-
ed with exquisite simplicity, revelatory of its sleeping
occupant, WILLIAM PARRISH, 64, a warm but commanding face, a
man of maturity yet who exudes a glow of enthusiasm.
Although asleep, there is an uncommon restlessness to him.
Parrish grips his upper arm as if in pain.  Now the severity
of the pain wakes him, he squeezes his arm.  The wind comes
up, through the wind a VOICE is heard distantly, or is it the
wind itself:"|stage direction||
7|VOICE (V.O.)|... Yes.|speech|VOICE|M
8||"Parrish blinks, has he heard something, has he not, he is
not sure, he releases his arm, his grimace of pain fades,
the discomfort seems momentarily to have subsided.
He rises now, crosses to the bathroom.  As he pees, a breeze
outside the window, the wind again, but then the Voice comes
up:"|stage direction||
9|VOICE (V.O.)|Yes...|speech|VOICE|M
10||"It is unmistakably a Voice, it is not the wind, Parrish has
heard something, he looks around, but no one is there.  He
can't finish peeing, turns back to his bedroom.  All beweild-
ered, Parrish looks around once more, climbs back into bed,
trying to trace the source of what he has heard or hasn't
heard; he is not sure.
He pulls the covers up now, not a SOUND, tries to close his
eyes."|stage direction||
11|VOICE (V.O.)|Yes.|speech|VOICE|M
12||"Parrish sits up again, frightened, but still there is no one
there, he seems fraught with indecision, should he get up,
should he not, what is happening?  He looks out: absolute
stillness and silence, CRICKETS chirp down by the river, a
light FLICKERS from a shadboat, Parrish closes his eyes but
then they flutter open, he glances up at the ceiling and
finally, exhausted, falls back asleep."|stage direction||
13||EXT. REAR TERRACE, PARRISH COUNTRY ESTATE - NEXT MORNING|location||
14||"The great lawn infested with workmen, planting stakes, un-
rolling a huge canvas tent, gardeners fashioning topiary and
adding landscaping of their own, crews setting up platforms,

older daughter, foremen competing for her attention and she
relishing every moment.

structing the number '65' on the
barge, archers from the State
College at New Paltz will shoot
flaming arrows at it, when it
catches fire it will give us the
effect of a Viking funeral with none

pilot waves to Drew, indicating 'phone call'.  Drew gets up
and heads for the cockpit, Parrish scans the folders, glances
over at Susan who is making some notes on a file of her own.
He motions to her to please come sit beside him, she checks
that Drew is still busy in the cockpit, tucks her papers into
her carryall, and crosses over to Parrish who folds away the
work that Drew set before him into his tray table, locks it."|stage direction||

about Drew, it's what you don't say."|speech|PARRISH|M

147|PARRISH|"I know it's a cornball thing but
love is passion, obsession, someone
you can't live without.  If you
don't start with that, what are you
going to end up with?  I say fall
head over heels.  Find someone you
can love like crazy and who'll love
you the same way back.  And how do
you find him?  Forget your head and
listen to your heart.  I'm not
hearing any heart."|speech|PARRISH|M
148||(a moment)|location||
149|PARRISH|"Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll
come back.  Because, the truth is
there is no sense living your life
without this.  To make the journey
and not fall deeply in love -- well,
you haven't lived a life at all.
You have to try.  Because if you
haven't tried, you haven't lived."|speech|PARRISH|M

his laptop in order to pull out some
key phrases when he gives the
Commencement Speech at Wharton."|speech|PARRISH|M

Susan has squeezed into a seat in the corner.  A counterman,
with a smile and a greeting, places a cup of coffee in front
of her.  A sense this is a daily ritual, arming herself for

flinches with a spasm of pain in his shoulder.  It is sharp

ignores it.

pain comes again.  He reaches for his shoulder, tries to

But it did get me to thinking.  I
started in this business because
this is what I wanted to do.  I knew
I wasn't going to write the Great
American Novel, but I also knew
there was more to life than buying
something for a dollar and selling
it for two.  I wanted to give the
news to the world, and I wanted to
give it unvarnished.  The more we
all know about each other, the
greater the chance we will survive.
Sure, I want to make a profit, you
can't exist without one but John
Bontecou is all profit.  If we give
him license to absorb Parrish
Communications, and he has his eye
on a few others after us, we'll be
appointing him to the position he
craves -- Gatekeeper.  In order to
reach the world you will have to go
through John Bontecou.  And not only
will you have to pay him to do this,
far more expensive, you'll have to
agree with him.  Reporting the news
is a privilege and a responsibility
and it is not exploitable.  Parrish
Communications has earned this priv-
ilege, John Bontecou wants to buy
it.  As your chairman, I urge you to
agree this company is not for sale."|speech|PARRISH|M

bygones be bygones.  But can I tell
you something else, it'd be nice to

1697|PARRISH|"I'm not interested in the details.
And I'm not interested in the big
picture either.  What I am inter-

further proposal from a man whom it

appropriate.  We are your Board, we
have a right to know how you are

1812||"She gets up, closes the door, sits back down again next to
Joe.  A warm, awkward silence, they move closer to each
other, now they fall into a foreplay which Susan recognizes
as such, Joe, on the other hand, participates hungrily but
has no knowledge where it is leading.  His movements are
instinctive, the smell of her hair, the shape of her fin-
gers, odd things about her seem to interest him.  This
excites her because she senses his untutoredness and the
very sense of that stirs her, their reactions to each other
are intuitive and spontaneous; even though Joe has no know-
ledge of how to make love to a woman, ironically his actions
are such that they never beg the question -- has he done it
before.
Strange territory for Joe, not to be 'in control' and exert-
ing his power, but his inventions and responses in lovemak-
ing are so real that an emotional exchange between he and
Susan builds.  Joe has found himself in an unexplored land
of feeling and passion, he loves what is happening and yet
at the same time, is terrified by it.  He feels himself being
lured by some power he has not only never been aware of, but
is deeply dangerous to partake of; he knows what he is doing
is putting who he is at great risk, yet he goes right on.
The powerful contradiction is transmitted to Susan, and in
the end there is the knowledge they have together made a
journey, they both have been swept away in a stream of events
they have created; and they don't care about the consequences.
Spent, they lie in silence.  Finally Susan speaks:"|stage direction||

Machiavellian that it has rarely

of secrecy he took, his task would
have been far easier, he could have
turned defeat into victory, but he
is too honorable a man to have done

fireworks display.  Among them is Susan, but her interest
isn't there.  Not something pulls her attention, an over-
powering feeling that compels her to turn and see, at a

Down below, Susan, in a pained reflex, again turns and looks
up towards the hill.  There is nobody there.  She hesitates,
now glides away from the party, her step quickens as she
walks up towards the hill.
Susan halts, in the distance a figure is approaching from
over the crest of the hill where Joe and Parrish disappeared.
He is heading straight for her, she tries to make him out,
seems to recognize him, starts to walk towards him as if
pulled by a magnet.  Now she stops again.  It is a man, he
keeps coming, and now that he is close and recognizes him."|stage direction||
