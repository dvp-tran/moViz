speaking.  HELEN is a forensic psychologist.  Behind her is
a projected diagram: PREDISPOSITION, DISSOCIATION, TRAUMA,
FANTASY, VIOLENT FANTASY, FACILITATORS, MURDER, and
TRAUMA-REINFORCEMENT which she can point to with a laser
pointing device.  We see her from a considerable
distance... the back of the balcony.  Her voice is crisp and
assured."|stage direction|||
2|HELEN|"Our society creates these socially
and psychically disenfranchised
men, and their revenge on society
is terrible.  They are hard to
catch.  They are ""the nice guy next
door,"" their employers -- if they
work at all -- find them quiet and
uncomplaining.  Early abuse and
rejection have taught them
passivity.  Only in their violent
fantasies do they feel alive.  What
they seek in their frenzied
assaults on their victims is relief
from passivity.  For these men, ten
minutes relief is worth far more
than the life of another human
being.  Torture, the pain they
inflict, the screams of the victim,
are all part of the ritual that
gives them a brief respite from
their own psychic pain.  And then
the depression, the forgetting, the
feeling of sadness and despair
begins the cycle all over again.
Like addicts seeking their drug,
Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono,
Berkowitz, Dahmer, Bundy -- they
seek out their next victim."|speech|HELEN|M|True

HELEN'S POV:
Sitting in the front row of the balcony, a YOUNG RED-HEADED
MAN (DARYLL LEE CULLUM) leans forward, resting his tattooed
arms on the railing.  He smiles intimately at HELEN.
HELEN cuts her eyes to the left.  She sees:
Backstage, an overweight COP in plain clothes.  Instantly
alert to HELEN'S alarm, he jumps up, comes within an inch of
exposing his presence to the audience.  A SECOND COP, in the
wings on the other side of the stage, also springs to
attention.  FIRST COP'S eyes follow HELEN'S...
