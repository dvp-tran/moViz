2||INT. VICTORIAN ESTATE - 1895 - DAY|location
3||"CLOSE UP: Ornate antique GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes 2:15.
The credits begin to roll.
Calligraphy place cards are painstakingly hand-written in
preparation for a formal reception.
Servants meticulously clean an elaborate crystal chandelier.
Hands rapidly shine silver cutlery.
Fresh flowers arranged in several enormous vases."|stage direction
4||INT. KITCHEN - DAY|location
5||"Kitchen clock strikes 2:15.
Poultry plucked. Feathers everywhere.
Steaming copper pots boiling over. Platters prepared with
decorative garnish.
Extravagant tiered cake is lavishly iced. A glob of frosting
enters a pair of puckered lips. The perpetrator, a fey,
pompous, HEAD VALET, seriously considers the texture and
flavor of the icing, then gives the PASTRY CHEF a withering,
sour look.
The valet, oblivious to the chef's fury, gathers a prepared
silver breakfast tray and checks his pocket watch. 2:15."|stage direction
6||INT. BEDROOM - DAY|location
7||"Antique bedside table clock -- just past 2:15. The valet
throws open velvet drapes, sunlight FLOODS the room revealing
a figure sleeping soundly in a massive oak framed bed. The
valet puts down the tray, pulls back the quilt.
The dozing figure gives the valet a deliberate, angry KICK.
Flinching infinitesimally, the valet crosses to the closet,
selects three suits and holds them up for inspection. From
beneath the puffiest of pillows, AN EYE reluctantly opens. A
weary arm points decisively to the riding outfit."|stage direction
8||EXT. ESTATE - DAY|location
9||"The riding outfit is adorned by LEOPOLD, Duke of Albany, a
dashing, virile man in his 30's. GALLOPING with great abandon,
he expertly leads his horse up hills and over hedges. He
sends gardeners shaping the grounds fleeing from his path.
In the background, lanterns are being strung throughout the
estate. Rugs are beaten out of open windows."|stage direction
10||INT. HALLWAY - EVENING|location
11||"Large hallway clock -- 6:15. A pair of boots track a freshly
scrubbed floor as Leopold heads carelessly up the stairway.
Three steps behind, the valet snaps his fingers signaling
the staff to clean up the mess.
SERIES OF CLOSE UPS
Gaudily framed portraits of somber relations.
A bird sits listless in a gilded cage.
Hot water is poured into a bath.
Carriages begin to arrive.
Orchestra leader signals the musicians to play.
Guests fill the ballroom in formal attire."|stage direction
12||INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT|location
13||"Leopold stares haughtily into a full length mirror.
He wears only dotted linen drawers and a black silk top hat
of the period. He flexes slightly. The valet hastily fastens
a corset around his mid-section from behind.
Leopold eyes his reflection seductively. He becomes bored.
He turns to his right. The valet spoons sorbet from a silver
saucer into his mouth. He turns back to the mirror to watch
himself eat. The valet pats his mouth dry.
He affects a pampered STRUT, crossing the room as the valet
sprays a mixture of perfume and powder into the air. Leopold
thrusts out his arms walking through the mist, turns and
saunters back to his favorite place, in front of the mirror.
Finally, as if weighing a great decision, Leopold hands his
hat to his valet and nods firmly into the mirror.
CLOSE UP
Fine linen undervest slides over his head.
Black twilled worsted trousers pulled up to his waist.
The buttoning of his hard, white, roll collar.
A cream suede glove stitched in black slides over his hand.
A perfect tight bow tie is tied around his neck.
An elegant black tuxedo jacket with silk facings and tails
to the knees is fitted to his torso.
His hair is sleeked with oil and centrally parted.
His eyebrows are brushed with a tiny silver comb.
His cheeks are pinched.
A red silk handkerchief is placed in the bosom of his lapel.
Leopold stares into the mirror. The effect is DAZZLING. He
raises one eyebrow. Then, in a voice you could pour over a
waffle:"|stage direction
14|LEOPOLD|"You dance like a herd of cattle,
Miss Fairchild. You are a rare woman
who lights up the room... simply by
leaving it."|speech
15||"He bows. As he rises, the reflection of Leopold's UNCLE OTTO,
a pampered, effectual man in his 60's, appears behind Leopold
in the looking glass."|stage direction
16|UNCLE OTTO|"Tell me Leopold, do you plan to join
us downstairs after completing this
one-sided flash of wit?"|speech
17|LEOPOLD|"I despise affairs of this sort, Uncle
Otto. No one really listens to anyone
else. If you attempt it, you will
see why."|speech
18|UNCLE OTTO|"You judge everything too severely. I
wonder what would happen if you were
to cast that critical eye inward?"|speech
19|LEOPOLD|"You do not wonder at all. You merely
ask in order to state your own
opinion."|speech
20|UNCLE OTTO|We are all concerned about you.|speech
21|LEOPOLD|Ahh, here it comes.|speech
22|UNCLE OTTO|"Your life does not seem to have any
direction. At the age of 25 a man is
too young to do anything well. At 35
he is too old. Now is your time to
take action. Tell me, what is it you
want to DO with your life?"|speech
23||(wearily)|location
24|LEOPOLD|I do not know.|speech
25||(just as weary)|location
26|UNCLE OTTO|Your ignorance cramps my conversation.|speech
27||"(he slaps Leopold's
face twice rather
quickly)"|location
28|UNCLE OTTO|"Wake up! This is your one and only
life. Every man has the chance to
make a difference. DO something!"|speech
29||Leopold, stung, takes a moment to compose himself.|stage direction
30|LEOPOLD|"I am most grateful for your
surveillance and for your sympathy.
I assure you there is no need for
concern. I am as effectual and
attentive... as my position allows."|speech
31|UNCLE OTTO|"Life is not position, Leopold. It is
action."|speech
32||"(he straightens
Leopold's tie)"|location
33|UNCLE OTTO|"I will see you downstairs promptly.
In the appropriate frame of mind."|speech
34||"He leaves. Leopold stares into the mirror, snaps his fingers.
The valet hands him a glass and pours a small shot of brandy.
Leopold shoots him a look. The valet fills the glass higher.
Leopold drains the glass and heads to the doorway. He
hesitates, taking a deep breath and a long pause. Finally..."|stage direction
35||(grandly)|location
36|THE VALET|Go spread joy.|speech
37||Without looking back, Leopold leaves the room.|stage direction
38||INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT|location
39||"Music fills the air as the creme de la creme of Victorian
society gather inside. Leopold holds a prearranged dance
card. He looks at the names and finds his first partner is
MISS TREE. Leopold looks upward helplessly at an unrelenting
God."|stage direction
40||INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT|location
41||"A profoundly self-conscious Leopold dances energetically
into frame with MISS TREE, an ancient, elfin, yet amazingly
SPRY woman who gapes up at him searchingly, unblinking.
Leopold opens his mouth to speak, can think of nothing
suitable to say, and clamps his mouth shut. They dance out
of frame."|stage direction
42||INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT|location
43||"Leopold dances into frame with CLARA, a BEAUTIFUL girl of
19. He glances at her and smiles. She titters, turning away
shyly. They whirl around the dance floor. His smile grows
into a broad grin. Caught up in the excitement, Clara beams
up at him... happily revealing a mouth full of missing, inky
teeth.
Leopold, face frozen in a formal smile, dances on."|stage direction
44||INT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT|location
45||"Leopold lumbers into frame with MISS FAIRCHILD, a woman of
immense girth. With great dignity and extreme difficulty he
maneuvers her around the floor, looking everywhere except
her enormous bosom."|stage direction
46|LEOPOLD|"You dance like an angel, Miss
Fairchild. You light up the room. I
thank you."|speech
47||"Miss Fairchild curtseys heavily. Leopold glances at his card,
sees the name Miss Serena Clacket and shudders.
He spots a VERY LOVELY WOMAN hidden amongst the guests. She
scribbles in a small note pad, occasionally glancing around.
Hiding his dance card, he saunters over."|stage direction
48|LEOPOLD|"Good evening. I do not believe I
have had the pleasure."|speech
49||"The young woman stares vacantly at Leopold until she realizes
he is addressing her. She puts her pad away."|stage direction
50|CARLSON|...Julia Carlson.|speech
51||Leopold takes her hand and kisses it gently.|stage direction
52|CARLSON|I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?|speech
53||(slightly tipsy)|location

her head ""No"")"|location
56|CARLSON|Are you?|speech
57|LEOPOLD|This is my estate.|speech
58|CARLSON|Really?|speech
59||"(looking around the
room)"|location
60|CARLSON|Well it's not home but it's much...|speech
61||"Leopold regards her curiously. The orchestra starts up. There
is a hubbub amongst the guests."|stage direction
62|LEOPOLD|Shocking! The TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY.|speech
63|CARLSON|"The? Oh, that's from Paris, isn't
it?"|speech
64|LEOPOLD|It is a scandal nonetheless.|speech
65||Leopold spots Uncle Otto observing him from across the room.|stage direction
66|LEOPOLD|Miss Carlson, do me the honor?|speech
67|CARLSON|I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer.|speech
68||(smiling seductively)|location
69|LEOPOLD|"Truly I would be in your debt. Any
admonition would be erased simply by
presenting a partner as lovely as
yourself."|speech
70|CARLSON|No, no. Really, I...|speech
71||"Leopold stiffly holds out his arm. A beat. Carlson, stuck,
takes it WITH HESITATION and is escorted to the dance floor.
They dance. ALL but Leopold and Carlson gaily sing ""TA-RA-RA-
BOOM-DE-AY."" Leopold, flushed, looks quite smitten. Carlson,
shy at first, eventually smiles brightly."|stage direction
72|LEOPOLD|"I suppose we really ought to sing
along."|speech
73||(embarrassed)|location
74|CARLSON|Oh, golly.|speech
75||"They half sing, half speak the TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY, their
emphasis on ""BOOM."" Laughing giddily, their dancing becomes
freer, picking up speed. The room SPINS. Finally:"|stage direction
76||(breathless)|location
77|CARLSON|"Thank you for the dance. It was
lovely. I hope it wasn't too awful
for you."|speech
78|LEOPOLD|Not at all. It was most enlightening.|speech
79||"There is a slight pause. The Grandfather CLOCK strikes
midnight."|stage direction
80|CARLSON|I really must be going.|speech
81|LEOPOLD|I won't hear of it.|speech
82||(moving away from him)|location
83|CARLSON|No, I'm quite late as it is.|speech
84|LEOPOLD|I shall see you to the door...|speech
85||"(stopping him
resolutely)"|location
86|CARLSON|"You're very sweet. I had a wonderful
time."|speech
87||"(she watches him,
memorizing his face.
Then firmly)"|location
88|CARLSON|Goodbye.|speech
89||"Leopold takes a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. He
watches Carlson pass through the crowd and out the courtyard
door. He surveys the room. After a moment he follows her."|stage direction
90||EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT|location
91||"Leopold makes his way through the manicured garden in the
dark. He hears an EERIE METALLIC SOUND. He slows down, brushes
back the thicket. The silhouette of a woman is revealed. She
is once again writing in her notebook."|stage direction
92|LEOPOLD|Miss Carlson?|speech
93||"Carlson spins around quickly, panicked. Leopold STOPS.
Partially hidden in the brush, a sleek, oddly shaped,
MECHANICAL device. It's door open, lit from within, casting
a weird glow."|stage direction
94|LEOPOLD|Good God...|speech
95|CARLSON|What are you...? You frightened me.|speech
96||"Leopold moves toward the contraption and is about to touch
it..."|stage direction
97|LEOPOLD|What sort of mechanism is this?|speech
98||Carlson shakes her head, unsure of how to proceed.|stage direction
99|LEOPOLD|Answer me!|speech
100|CARLSON|It's perfectly all right. It's...|speech

Carlson FREEZES."|stage direction

deliberately)"|location
103|CARLSON|"Listen to me. Please. Move very
slowly. Step out of the machine.
Step out and I'll explain whatever
you want to know."|speech
104|LEOPOLD|What is this? Who are you?|speech
105||His hand comes to rest on a glowing red lever.|stage direction
106|CARLSON|Oh, God.|speech
107||"She YANKS on his arm. Instinctively he pulls away,
accidentally thrusting the lever into action. Carlson falls
from the machine."|stage direction
108||(suddenly frantic)|location
109|CARLSON|Get out of there! Get out now!|speech

door."|speech

The consequences could be
catastrophic."|speech
129|DR. KAU|He could be hurt, or even dead.|speech

145||"(using her middle
finger she pushes up
her glasses)"|location

Take care or good luck or whatever

from a printout)"|location
158|KATE|"...of Albany. He was the... IS the
son of Emery and Eliza. He was of no
actual importance until he vanished
at the turn of the century without a
trace. It was a sensation. In the
30's they even made a movie about
him. ""The Tenuous Duke"" with Ronald
Coleman."|speech
159||(absently)|location
160|DR. DRAKE|I love Ronald Coleman.|speech

165|DR. KAU|We never should have started this...|speech
166|KATE|Calm down.|speech
167|DR. PLODDER|"What are we going to do? We can't
keep him here. Imagine if anyone
found out!"|speech
168|KATE|"Think. Just, think. Rationally. Now,
no one would believe such a stupid
mistake could be made because no one
would believe any of this is possible.
So. We fix this. We keep this to
ourselves and we fix it. Fast."|speech
169||They all nod in agreement.|stage direction
170|KATE|"Dr. Kau, research all our data. 1st
priority: Locate Carlson. Drake,
determine the reciprocal correlation's

take charge of him."|speech
171||"She forces back panic. Only the tremor in her voice gives
her away."|stage direction
172|KATE|"This is a major scientific
opportunity. It doesn't get any better

behavior, the physical and emotional
characteristics of a century ago!
Utilizing technology available to us
today... He's a gold mine!"|speech
173|DR. PLODDER|He's a man, Kate. Not a guinea pig.|speech
174|KATE|"And while he's here, he's ours. Any
volunteers?"|speech
175||No one moves.|stage direction
176|DR. DRAKE|"We'll draw names. Whoever is is picked
will be responsible. Agreed?"|speech
177||"They nod reluctantly. Drake writes out names and throws them
in a cup. The silence becomes deafening. Finally:"|stage direction
178|DR. KAU|I'll do it.|speech
179||All the scientists face her.|stage direction
180|DR. PLODDER|You'll look after him?|speech

the government of the United States."|speech

appearance with
distaste)"|location
189|LEOPOLD|Oh. Americans. I see...|speech
190|KATE|"Yes, um... For the past six and a
half years we've been conducting
scientific experiments on density
and flexibility in the dimensions of
time and space."|speech
191|DR. DRAKE|"Yes, uh... Quite by accident we came
upon a formula utilizing Tachyons...
particles traveling faster than the
speed of light, which allowed us
to... fold time so to speak."|speech
192|DR. PLODDER|"Yes. Bend it between the cracks of
the dimensions."|speech
193|DR. KAU|Yes.|speech
194||They all laugh nervously. Leopold does not.|stage direction
195|DR. DRAKE|"Now, while that wasn't the original
purpose of our experiment, we opted
to pursue it, well, privately, on
our own."|speech
196|DR. KAU|Borrowing funds already provided.|speech
197|KATE|"We journeyed to your time because it
was the quickest path to follow. We
debated long and hard whether we
should use this knowledge at all.
Believe me, it was never our intent
to disturb the past..."|speech
198|DR. DRAKE|"Merely to discover if the expedition
were possible. As your presence here
confirms... we are very disturbed."|speech
199||Leopold nods at them as if they are insane.|stage direction
200|DR. PLODDER|"The problem facing us is not only
HOW to get you back, but WHEN, you
see?"|speech

miscalculate. Send you to a different
era entirely."|speech
202||Leopold starts to speak.|stage direction

you. You'll be well looked after by
Dr. Coles."|speech
204|LEOPOLD|"Dr. Coles...? I do not follow. What
do you mean, get me back home?...
Where am I?"|speech
205||"Awkward pause. Leopold looks carefully around the room for
the first time: modern mechanical equipment, data shifting
and changing, giant cooling devices, bright neon lighting.
The doctors are silent."|stage direction

take me for? Did you bring me here

His stomach sinks as he realizes THIS IS NO DREAM. He slowly
rises to his full stature, moving to the window he looks out

his way to the bedroom door and tentatively touches the knob.
There is a KNOCK on the door.
Leopold JUMPS back and runs to the bed: The picture of
dignity."|stage direction

261|LEOPOLD|A WOMAN of science?|speech

1783||"The music changes: A LIVELY CHARLESTON. Leopold heaves a
sigh of relief and makes his way through the crowd, up the
staircase.
The dancers become an intricate maze, a dead end at every
turn as Kate searches each male face.
In the foreground, Leopold is stopped by a woman midway up
the stairs. As they chat, Leopold reaches down and picks up
the muddy slipper, offering it to her. She turns in a huff,
flouncing down the stairs.
Simultaneously, in the background, Kate desperately looks
for Leopold.
Leopold studies the slipper as he makes his way up the stairs.
He slows down, hesitates and STOPS. Very slowly he turns
around. He becomes very still. TEARS well up in his eyes.
The ballroom clock strikes MIDNIGHT.
Kate climbs an opposite staircase to get a better view then
STOPS. In her heart SHE KNOWS. Slowly she turns. Leopold
stands quietly at the bottom of the stairs, gazing up at
her. He extends his arm, showing her THE RING. He offers her
his hand.
The crowd, the room, THE WORLD AROUND THEM, DISAPPEAR. Their
eyes lock. As she descends the staircase, THE YEARS MELT
AWAY. Kate's short hair grows long, cascading around her
shoulders. The fine lines around Leopold's face are gone.
They see themselves through each other's eyes, at the moment
of youth, when they fell in love.
Leopold bends down, places the slipper on Kate's foot. He
rises, looks down at his hands and then up at Kate. His hands
are caked with mud. She smiles helplessly. Not caring, he
wraps his arms tightly around her.
MUSIC begins to play, a slow waltz. He nods to her. She takes
a deep breath. Her head bobs in rhythm. She begins to count
silently. Leopold smiles, counting along.
THEY DANCE...
An elderly couple watch Leopold with interest."|stage direction

1786||"Kate and Leopold dance past. They are older. As they gaze
into each other's eyes, they twirl. THE LOOK OF YOUTH RETURNS.
At the center of the floor they stop dancing. THEY KISS. The
rest of the world dances around them.
Over this background... THE SCRAPBOOK PICTURES BLEED ONTO
SCREEN.
The old formal wedding photo becomes a photograph of Kate
and Leopold the perfect bride and groom, both discreetly
point to their rings.
Kate stands with Leopold as he establishes a scholarship for
studies in physics.
The old photograph of Leopold and Albert Einstein changes to
include Kate, waving and smiling broadly for the camera.
The professional photograph becomes a double portrait. It
shows the two in their 70's, sitting regally in matching
chairs. They hold hands and smile serenely. Staring directly
into the camera, they show off their rings.
SLOWLY the scrapbook closes...
Kate and Leopold dance, the music swells as they become lost
in the crowd. The clock CHIMES. Slowly we..."|stage direction
