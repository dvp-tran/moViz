3|Todd Farmer & Patrick Lussier|"Half a dozen abandoned shacks and a boarded up gas station
make up the central hub of Laughter, Colorado. She'd be a
ghost town ‘cept the ghosts considered her a shithole ages
ago and baled. The buck ten for leaded sign gives us an idea
how long ago this place went dry.
Suddenly an old Chevy RIPS around the corner, wheels sending
PLUMES of dust skyward."|speech

the main road in the distance when they round a corner --

TITLE CARD appears--"|speech

words right at us!"|speech
14|ANOTHER ANGLE|"...EXPLODING into the hood of the Chevy! The hood RIPS up,
SLAMS the windshield.
Truck CAREENS out of control!
Milton GUNS the Roadrunner away from truck...but...
KRAACK - The Truck nails the Roadrunner's rear quarter panel.
Roadrunner and truck go into a spin. A tornado of dust
SWIRLS around the two vehicles.
The Roadrunner SPLINTERS into a boarded store front!
The Truck HITS a ditch and UPENDS. Flips. SLAMS into the
dirt on its roof, wheels SPINNING."|speech
15|ANOTHER ANGLE|"Smoke HISSES from the totalled Roadrunner. Door creeks open.
Milton emerges slow and sure. He crosses toward the Chevy.
Fucking Passenger rises from behind the truck and rushes
Milton, tire iron held high over his head!
Milton spins and KUH-FOOM!
--blows Fucking Passenger's hand clean off! Passenger
screams as Milton snatches the iron out of the air and --
KER-ACK!

Milton stoops, removes Passenger's wallet, digs the cash out.
OVER MILTON'S SHOULDER
Fucking Driver scrambles from behind the wheel, springs to
his feet and runs.

Milton spins, BLOWS his knee apart from 20 paces. Driver
SCREAMS and face-firsts the cracked pavement."|speech
16|ANOTHER ANGLE|"As Fucking Middle drags himself from the passenger side. He
got the worst of it. Looks like his face went through the
windshield. He looks up --
-- into the barrel of Milton's shotgun. A beat."|speech
17|FUCKING MIDDLE|"I'll never tell you where they've
taken her...NEVER."|speech
18|MILTON|"I know.
The EXPLOSION vaporizes what's left of his face.
ON FUCKING DRIVER
As he tries to stand but his lower leg dangles from a piece
of cartilage. He falls, WRITHES on the ground. He looks up
at Milton standing over him."|speech
19|FUCKING DRIVER|"You...you took my leg you fuck!
Milton presses the shotgun barrel into the man's good knee."|speech
20|FUCKING DRIVER|Wait. Wait!|speech
21|MILTON|Where is she?|speech
22|FUCKING DRIVER|"I...I don't...
Suddenly Fucking Passenger, flattened by the tire iron, sits
up, dazed. Sees Milton. Spots the iron. Goes for it.
Milton spins and KAFOOM!
Blows Fucking Passenger to hell."|speech
23|FUCKING DRIVER|"Stillwater! Stillwater Marsh! I

Milton digs Driver's cell phone out...stares at it for a
moment, drops it, finds wallet, takes cash."|speech
24|FUCKING DRIVER|"But you're too late. You gotta
know that. Next full moon she's
dead. Nothing you can do. She's
dead and hell will walk the earth--
WHAM!
Milton shoves the barrel of his shotgun into the man's mouth,
breaking a couple teeth in the process.
Milton hisses, his throat dry, like a man who hasn't quenched
his thirst in a decade."|speech
25|MILTON|"You tell him I'm coming. You got
that? I'm coming to get her back.
You tell him. Tell him I'm gonna

those diners where white trash goes to die. Half a dozen
PATRONS sit at bar and booth as a young American Indian
couple, MARY and DALE, enter with their children 2, 4 and 7.
Two waitresses, PIPER (25) and NORMAJEAN (57) stand at the
kitchen pick-up window. Through which we can see the
joint's owner, FAT LOU, dripping sweat into a pile of
scrambled eggs. Fat Lou is fat. Holy fuck fat."|speech
30|PIPER|"So I tell him, I says, “Frank,
that's it. No more free milk. You
gonna have to buy the cow you son
of a bitch.”

32|PIPER|"Wha? No, NormaJean, “buy the cow.”
Marry me? He's got to marry me.
I'm sayin I cut him off."|speech
33|NORMAJEAN|You cut him off?|speech
34|PIPER|"Not just yes but hell yes! No
tits, no ass. And I told him if I
see that big ol' dick of his
anywhere near my face I'm gonna
bite it in half.
Normajean giggles with embarrassment."|speech
35|NORMAJEAN|"You said that? How long's it been?
Piper frowns."|speech
36|PIPER|"Well, it's only been two days but
that's like a decade in horny
fucker years."|speech
37|NORMAJEAN|So he bought you a diamond?|speech
38|PIPER|"A diamond? God no. If Frank had
money for a diamond I would have
jacked his sorry ass ages ago and
put this shithole life in the rear
view. But he did get down on his
knees and ask me to be his bride."|speech
39|NORMAJEAN|No way.|speech
40|PIPER|"Yes way!
NormaJean grabs Piper in a great big hug."|speech
41|NORMAJEAN|"Oh! Piper!

FF-FF-FFUMP!
Something yellow peppers them both. The girls look up as --
Fat Lou SLAMS two plates of food into the window."|speech
43|PIPER|"Did...did you just throw scrambled
eggs at us?"|speech
44|FAT LOU|"I don't pay you bitches to stand
around. Now get the fuck back to work!
Piper snatches one of the plates.
She delivers it to a Patron sitting at the bar, then turns
toward the newly arrived customers.
The American Indian couple scans a menu...
...and Milton (the old guy from our opening) scans her...he
quickly looks down at an unfolded map of Colorado as --
NormaJean steps up to Milton."|speech
45|NORMAJEAN|Hello beautiful, coffee?|speech
46|MILTON|"That'd be great. Tell me,
Stillwater Marsh around here?"|speech
47|NORMAJEAN|"(shrugs) Stillwater...doesn't ring
a bell. I'll get that coffee.
But Milton makes eye contact with Mary, the Indian mother.
She quickly looks away. She knows something...
Milton opens his mouth to speak as--
--Piper approaches the American Indian couple."|speech
48|PIPER|"Hi guys, I'm Piper. Can I bring
you something to drink?"|speech
49|MOTHER MARY|"We'll take this.
7.
Mary points to the menu, Piper leans in, reads."|speech

Ten monster flapjacks for 4.99."|speech
51|MOTHER MARY|And five waters.|speech
52|PIPER|"Five waters. And what can I get for...
Father averts his eyes. He's embarrassed."|speech
53|MOTHER MARY|"That's it. Just the pancakes. If
that's okay?
Piper stares at them as if for the first time. Shit...
they're hungry. And broke."|speech
54|PIPER|"Oh. Of course. Coming right up.
Piper shoots Milton a look as she crosses to the kitchen.
Milton rises slightly. He's clearly trying to get Mary's
attention. She's ignoring him.
Piper calls through the window to Fat Lou."|speech
55|PIPER|"One brickhouse.
She turns and stops suddenly. Stares at a pile of muffins
kept fresh within a glass cake stand."|speech
56|ANOTHER ANGLE|Mary can no longer avoid Milton's stare.|speech
57|MILTON|"Stillwater Marsh? You know it?
Dale, the father, keeps his back to Milton as he speaks."|speech
58|DALE|No. We don't.|speech

8."|speech
60|MOTHER MARY|You're in the wrong state.|speech
61|DALE|Mary!|speech
62|MILTON|"And what state Should I be in?
Dale turns, glares at Milton."|speech
63|DALE|"Nevada. Catch the 50 and cut across.
It's a two day drive from here."|speech
64|MILTON|And Wolf Deer Run?|speech
65|DALE|"Never heard of it.
The 7 year old LITTLE GIRL'S eyes brighten."|speech
66|LITTLE GIRL|"Yes you have daddy. Wolf Deer Run,
that's where The Smiling Man takes
the wicked children to see the
Mother of all things.
Mary SHUSHES her Little Girl and pulls her close."|speech
67|MILTON|"Mother of all things, that sounds
very interesting."|speech
68|LITTLE GIRL|"Oh it is! The Mother of all things
bleeds black tears unto those who"|speech
69|CUT HER--|Mother places her hand over her daughter's mouth.|speech
70|MOTHER MARY|"It's nothing. Just a story parents
tell to their children. Like the
boogey-man or the tooth-fairy.
A plate filled with muffins thumps down before them. Piper
leans in with three kiddie cups."|speech
71|PIPER|"And three milks.
9."|speech
72|MOTHER MARY|But we didn't order--|speech
73|PIPER|"(whispers) --On the house.
She winks and moves away...eyeing the kitchen window. She
doesn't notice..."|speech
74|MILTON|"staring at her again. An impressed smirk on his face.
Suddenly NormaJean steps in front of him."|speech
75|NORMAJEAN|"So, aren't you gonna ask what time
my shift ends? Full moon tonight.
I'm always a little ‘randy' during
full moon."|speech
76|MILTON|Full moon's three days off.|speech

His fat fingers tighten around her shoulder."|speech

them for those muff...
Piper strikes. Like a snake. Her hand reaches beneath the
fat of his belly and vice grips his balls. Hell, we even
hear the CRUNCH.
Fat Lou GASPS and doubles over allowing Piper to SLAM her
forehead into the bridge of his nose!
KER-RACK!"|speech

His nose seeps blood."|speech

She SLAPS him across the face with her free hand.
11."|speech

She takes a step backwards, but keeps her hand clamped to his
nuts. He has no choice but follow.
She pulls him up to the American Indian family."|speech
97|PIPER|Tell'em.|speech

We see it in her face. She squeezes. Lou's eyes go
wide...flutter...he's about to pass out."|speech
99|PIPER|"Tell them...the muffins...are on
the house."|speech
100|FAT LOU|"On. The. House.
She lets go. Lou drops to his knees, then timbers to the
floor as Piper turns to the family.
The children are huddled, terrified against their parents."|speech
101|PIPER|"I'm sorry your kids had to see
that. Put some honey butter on
those bran muffins and they taste
an awful lot better.
