The Tall Men move slowly towards the big cell, somewhat
cautious. They see the Bodyguard a second too late, for he
sticks the shotgun between the bars, and shoots one of them

the blue truck, one handing Azul a guitar case. Azul tosses
it onto the hood. The Bodyguards wave as they drive away.
Azul waves back. He opens the case, revealing an arsenal of
weaponry. Azul notices one piece is missing. One Rat quickly
pulls the missing weapon from his jacket and replaces it in
the case. Azul is unamused. He grabs his MAC-10 machine gun
from the guitar case and aims it at the thieving Rat's head.
Suddenly, the Guard bolts out the jail waving the wad of
money, as if complaining.
Azul turns his MAC-10 onto the Guard instead. A few blasts

helplessly on the ground, still clutching the money in his

The Young Men gently taps one switch and the keyboard sounds
like an accordion, pulsing out a beat. He then presses
another switch and a horn section swells to a crescendo and
