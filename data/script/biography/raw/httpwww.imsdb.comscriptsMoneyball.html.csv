Cinder-block tunnels lit with wire-encased lamps like in
a coal mine. THREE SECURITY GUARDS watch a game on a TV.
LEGEND: October 15, 2001
We begin to hear disembodied cheering crowds and the
faint voice of an announcer -
BRENNAMAN V/O

has just three at bats in the series, and
none of them hits - as he settles back in"|speech

diamond. Just a couple of the floodlights are on.
BRENNAMAN V/O
- Rivera looks in for the sign, he has
it, the pitch, Saenz swings and -
The announcer's voice and excited crowd abruptly cut
off. In silence, we regard the 60,000 empty seats that
wrap around the playing field ... but then see that, in
fact, it's 59,999 empty seats. There's a lone figure
seated in one of them. The sound snaps back on:
STEVE LYONS V/O
- a ground out to second, Thom, is not
what the A's were looking for from Saenz -
down by two in the ninth -
The lone man in the stadium has a radio and a bag of
peanuts. He seems at peace as he looks down on the empty
diamond - a peace only slightly belied, perhaps, by the
baseball he absently turns in a hand. He switches the
radio back on -
BRENNAMAN V/O
Eric Byrnes has emerged from the dugout
to bat for Menechino -

He turns it off again. Calmly eats a peanut. Waits.
Switches the radio back on -
BRENNAMAN V/O
- the A's are down to their last strike
and this Yankee crowd is on its feet -
Rivera squints for the sign, he has it,
delivers and -
Again, at the crucial moment, he cuts the radio. Waits
just a few moments. Turns the radio back on -
BRENNAMAN V/O
It is bedlam in New York. The Yankees -
down two games to none - have come back
to win three, and the Division Series.
The outcome of the series seems to have no effect on
Billy. He simply gets up, switches off the radio, and
climbs the steps to leave. But somehow we still faintly
hear, as he comes past shuttered concession stands toward
an exit, the voice of one of the announcers -
STEVE LYONS V/O
This is an exceptional feat not only for
New York, Thom, but for Oakland - though
not the kind you can be proud of: Only
once before has a team lost a Division
Series after winning the first two games -"|speech

see Chad Bradford out of the pen tonight
when we're in, let's say, just to make it
easier for you, any situation.

The camera pans down the huge scoreboard. It's

Durham as we hear the venerable voice of ESPN's Joe
Morgan, who's speaking post-game.
JOE MORGAN V/O
The flaw in the A's thinking, and this
comes from the top of their organization--
is their failure to comprehend you have
to manufacture runs in the post season.
Durham fouls off a pitch. Strike two.
JOE MORGAN V/O
You have to steal. You have to bunt. You
have to sacrifice. You have to trust in
small ball, not Billy Ball.
Durham swings at the fastball and connects, but it's a
pop fly to second which a TWINS INFIELDER easily nabs.
The PITCHER throws his glove in the air and the CATCHER
runs out to the mound as the rest of the Twins run to the
middle of the field to begin their victory celebration.
Durham turns away and heads back to the dugout.
The A's have lost the series.
