Silent and endless.  The stars shine like the love of
God...cold and remote.  Against them drifts a tiny chip
of technology.
CLOSER SHOT  It is the NARCISSUS, lifeboat of the
ill-fated star-freighter Nostromo.  Without interior
or running lights it seems devoid of life.  The PING
of a RANGING RADAR grows louder, closer.  A shadow
engulfs the Narcissus.  Searchlights flash on, playing
over the tiny ship, as a MASSIVE DARK HULL descends
toward it."|stage direction

in the dusty windows.  Outside, massive metal forms can
BE SEEN descending around the shuttle.  Like the tolling
of a bell, a BASSO PROFUNDO CLANG reverberates through
the hull.
CLOSE ON THE AIRLOCK DOOR  Light glares as a cutting
torch bursts through the metal.  Sparks shower into the
room.
A second torch cuts through.  They move with machine
precision, cutting a rectangular path, converging.  The
torches meet.  Cut off.  The door falls inward REVEALING
a bizarre multi-armed figure.  A ROBOT WELDER.
FIGURES ENTER, backlit and ominous.  THREE MEN in
bio-isolation suits, carrying lights and equipment.  They
approach a sarcophaguslike HYPERSLEEP CAPSULE, f.g."|stage direction

TIGHT ON RIPLEY  screaming, snapping up INTO FRAME.
Alone in the darkened hospital room.  She gasps for
breath, clutching pathetically at her chest.  There is
no demented horror rigging itself out of her.  Her eyes
snap about wildly, slowly focusing on the reality of
her safety.  Shuddering, bathed in sweat, she kneads her
breastbone with the heel of her hand and sobs.

CLANG.  PULL BACK as the rack of tactical missiles is
lifted, REVEALING two powerful hydraulic arms.
Spunkmeyer, seated inside a POWER LOADER, swings the
ordnance up into a belly nacelle of the DROP-SHIP where
it locks into place.  As he exerts pressure with his
hands against the servo-controls the hydraulic arms
move correspondingly...but with a thousandfold increase
in power.  The forklift-style CLAWS on each arm can
crush with tons of pressure.  The loader has an open
ROLL CAGE to protect the operator, and is supported
by squat HYDRAULIC LEGS which also move correspondingly
with the driver's movements.
You have never seen anything like this before.
Advanced as it is to us, it's only an old forklift
to them...battered and well used.  Covered with grease.
Repainted many times.  Across the back is stencilled
""CATERPILLAR.""

of multiple legs across the polished floor, for example.
There is only the droning HUM of the little space heater.
Ripley reaches up and, clutching the springs of the
underside of the cot, begins to inch it away from the
wall.
The SQUEAL OF METAL as the legs scrape across the floor
is jarringly loud in the stillness.
When the space is wide enough she cautiously slides
herself up between the wall and the edge of the cot,
reaching for the rifle she left lying on top of the
mattress.  Here yes clear the edge of the bed.  The rifle
is GONE.

above her face.  Its legs and tail writhe with
incredible ferocity and it emits a demented, piercing
SQUEAL.
Ripley heaves Newt across the polished floor and in a
frenzied scramble rolls from beneath the cot.  She
flips it over, trapping the creature underneath.
They back away, gasping.  Ripley's eyes flash around

happens.  Disabled from outside.  She tries the lights.

eye level with a complex surgical MULTILIGHT.  She
looks into its tangle of arms and cables, inches away.
Looks away.  Her eyes snap back.  SOMETHING LEAPS AT
HER FACE.  She SCREAMS and topples off the table,
splashing to the floor.  Newt shrieks and scrambles
away as Ripley hurls the CHITTERING creature off of
her.  It slams against a wall of cabinets, clings
for a moment, then leaps back as if driven by a
steel spring.  Ripley scrambles desperately, pulling
equipment over on top of herself, clawing across the
floor in a frenzy of motion.  In a blurr of
multijointed legs the creature scuttles up her body.
She tears at it, but it is incredibly powerful for
its size.  It moves like lightning toward her head,
avoiding her fumbling hands.  Newt screams abjectly,
backing away, until she is pressed up against a
desk in one corner.
Ripley has both hands up, forcing the pulsing body
back from her face.  The thing's tail whips around
her throat and begins to tighten, forcing the underside
of its body close to her.  Ripley thrashes about,
knocking over equipment, sending instruments CLATTERING.
Water streams over her, into her eyes, blinding her

body.
ANGLE ON NEWT  as crablike legs appear from behind the
desk, right behind her.  She sees it and, thinking
fast, jams the desk against the wall, pinning the
writhing thing.  The desk jumps and shudders against
all the pressure her tiny body can bring to bear on it.
She wails between gritted teeth as the second creature
gets one leg free, then another and another.  Squeezing
itself inexorably onto the desk top...toward her.
The legs of the chittering thing claw at Ripley's
head, getting a surer grip even as she whips her head
from side to side.  The obscene TUBULE extrudes wetly
from the sheath on the creature's underside, forcing
itself between the arms she has crossed tightly over
her face.
A figure appears at the observation window, a silhouette
behind the misted-over glass.  A hand wipes a clear spot.
Hick's eyes appear.  He steps back.  WHAM!  A burst of
pulse-rifle fire shatters the tempered glass.  Hicks
dives into the crazed spider web pattern and explodes
into the room in a shower of fragments.  He hits
rolling, his armor grinding through the shards, and
slides across to Ripley.  He gets his fingers around the
thrashing legs of the vicious beast and pulls.  Between
the two of them they force is away from her face,
though Ripley is losing strength as the tail tightens
sickeningly around her throat.  Hudson leaps into the
room, flings Newt away from the desk to go skidding
across the wet floor, and blasts the second creature
against the wall.  Point-blank.  Acid and smoke.

glowing cherry-red pass by.  Steam hisses and billows.
The lift clatters in a steady beat.  Hypnotic.
Ripley removes her jacket and dons a battle harness
directly over her T-shirt.  Her hair is matted, and
she glistens with sweat.  Her eyes burn with a
determination that holds the gut-panic in check.
The elevator descends.  She checks her weapon.  Attaches
a BANDOLIER OF GRENADES to her harness.  Primes the
flamethrower.  Checks the rifle's magazine.  Racks the
bolt, chambering the first round.  She checks the
MARKING FLARES jammed in the thigh pockets of her
jump pants.  She drops an unprimed grenade, trembling,
forcing herself to be strong.  We SEE she doesn't
know doodley about grenades.
This is the most terrifying thing she has ever done.  She
begins to hyperventilate, soaking with sweat.  Her fingers
slick and slippery on the rifle.  The elevator descends.
The lift motors whine, slowing.  It hits bottom with a
bump.  The safety cage retracts.  Slowly, expectantly,
the doors open.
HER P.O.V.  THROUGH the parting doors...an empty
corridor.  Dark, swirling with steam, a ruddy glow
VISIBLE here and there.  It seems to have been a descent

fill the chamber.  She turns.  And there it is.

glowers over her eggs like a great, glistening black
insect-Buddha.  What's bigger and meaner than the
Alien?  His momma.  Her fanged head is an unimaginable
horror.  Her six limbs, the four arms and two
powerful legs, are folded grotesquely over her
distended abdomen.  The egg-filled abdomen swells
and swells into a great pulsing tubular sac, suspended
from a lattice of pipes and conduits by a weblike
membrane as if some vast coil of intestine were draped
carelessly among the machinery.  Ripley realizes
she ducked under part of it a moment before.  Inside
the abdominal sac can be SEEN the forms of countless
eggs, churning their way toward the pulsating ovipositor

DRONES.  The drones are tiny scuttling albino versions
of the ""warrior"" aliens we have already seen.
Ripley pumps the slide on her grenade launcher.  She
fires.  Pumps and fires again.  Four times.  The
grenades punch deep into the egg sac and EXPLODE,
ripping it open from within.  Eggs are tons of gelatinous
matter pour across the chamber floor.  The Queen goes
berserk, SCREECHING like some psychotic steam whistle.
Ripley lays about her with the flamethrower, igniting
everything in sight with an insane fury.  Eggs shrivel
in the inferno, and figures of warriors and drones
vanish in frenzied thrashing.  Over all is the Queen's
shrieking as she struggles in the flames.  Two
warriors emerge from the boiling smoke, closing on
her.  She pulls the trigger...an empty click.  DIGITAL
COUNTER flashing crimson zeroes.  She drops the
magazine, grabs another from her belt, rams it home
